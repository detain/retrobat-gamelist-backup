		<name>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1988)</name>
		<desc>The game is based on an idea by Jules Verne.

In 5th July 1867 the government has decided on the departure of the famous ship the ''Abraham Lincoln'', which will leave on the trail of the sea monster. The great French professor Mr. Arronax will also take part in the expedition. The weeks passed without any sign of the monster's presence in the area, when, one day, 300 miles from the shores of Queen Charlotte's Island... three members of the expedition will set on board the Nautilus, submarine navigated by Captain Nemo. The player takes the Anorax' role to find out more.

The most part of the game is spent on the Nautilus which consists of three rooms: the living room, the control room and the library. There the player can manipulate objects and talk to people to receive hints what to do next and the state of the Nautilus. With the map he influences the route. Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to explore other locations respectively solves puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action sequences, e.g. fighting against a shark.

The game is played in real-time which means the key to success is being at the right location in the right time. This also results in various possibilities to render the game unwinnable and regular waiting times. The player also needs to watch Nemo's mood, if he angers Nemo, e.g. by manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the player into his room and valuable time passes. The game is played completely in point &amp; click and has no function to save progress.</desc>

		<desc>Some would call it Impossible Pinball.  Not that it is difficult to play, rather that you could never build a pinball machine that could do the type of things that this game does.  But it seems as though that's the point.  As like any pinball game, there is an underlying plot in which you must achieve certain goals on each of the three pinball tables (you can warp between them).This takes you off into the fantasy pinball world, where anything can happen.  Tanks can attack your ball, comets can fly in and create a crater in the middle of the board.  Who knows what will happen next.</desc>

You make Ace walk around by clicking on the screen, and tell him to interact with objects by clicking on them. At any time, Ace can access his watch, where settings can be changed and the game saved. Some puzzles are classic ''use item on item'' adventure fare, but there are lots of action mini-games.</desc>

		<desc>After Dark was a series of computer screensaver software introduced in 1989 by Berkeley Systems for the Apple Macintosh, and for Microsoft Windows in 1991.

Following the original, new editions were introduced including More After Dark and Before Dark, as well as editions themed around licensed properties such as Star Trek, The Simpsons, Looney Tunes and Walt Disney Company characters.[2] The screensaver modules were often noted for their intertextuality, such as the flying toasters appearing in the Fish screensaver, and the cat from Boris screensaver appearing in the Bad Dog screensaver.

As well as the included animated screensavers, it allowed the development and use of third-party modules, of which many hundreds were created by the height of After Dark's popularity</desc>

Age of Sail is a real time combat game. You control a tall ship and engage in cannon battles with enemy fleets. Gameplay centers around tactical decisions like selection of ordinance for the cannons, using the wind and maneuvering into position to fire at the enemy. In the campaign mode you start as an Ensign for one of four countries - Britain, Spain, France or the United States - and work your way up through the ranks. There are also about one hundred historical scenarios you can play, most of them taking place during the Napoleonic wars and the War of 1812. Scenarios give you control of multiple ships per battle.</desc>

There is no ''winning'' in this game; you play rounds of varying difficulty in which you must direct planes through waypoints, clear planes for takeoff, change altitude, etc. without them crashing or colliding in mid-air. You can select your difficulty from a series of pre-defined options or make your custom rounds by selecting parameters such as numbers of planes, time available, etc.The game screen is divided in two, with the upper half being your view from the tower, and where animations for different events happen (crashes, etc.) and the lower half the being the main game interface where you have your radar and communications interfaces.In addition to the main game, the CD includes a series of complementary materials regarding planes and other reference info.</desc>

		<desc>The player searches through a museum of twelve rooms for a deck of 53 cards, upon which are clues which will lead to the last room and the end game. Those cards are hidden among artwork inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice novels - to find them the player has to solve puzzles of varying complexity. The art is very interactive, but those hot spots are not marked when touching them with the mouse. Finding them might result in bizarre results like turning the room upside-down. This game knows no save feature and doesn't track how many cards are found. The player needs to write down the clues he already found until he can puzzle together how to find the exit.</desc>

As with the classic Space Invaders game the player has a canon which they can move to the right and left along the base of the game window. The canon fires upwards at the descending alien ships. This game varies from the original game in a number of ways:  Here there are no buildings to hide behind.  In another variation from the original game the alien ships land and steal the planets resources, these ships must be destroyed once they take-off as if they reach the top of the screen the players score is reduced.  Finally, the player must protect defending craft as they take-off. Shooting these down by mistake also reduces the player's scoreThe game is entirely keyboard controlled. The player's score is displayed in the game's title bar as the game progresses, there is no high score feature.</desc>

		<name>Allied General</name>
		<desc>Allied General is the sequel to Panzer General and uses the same turn-based gameplay mechanics. This time the player experiences World War II from the Allied point of view during two British, one U.S. and one Russian campaign. The settings are Europe, Russia and Northern Africa.The most important thing to have are prestige points. These are earned by solving scenarios (more for a little amount of turns) and used to buy replacement units. But this is not the only reason to be concerned about the detailed mission results: surviving units are transferred to the next mission and receive experience points. The campaign is also not completely linear, and the next mission depends on the result of the last - this means a lost scenario does not necessarily result in a game over, and a scarce victory can have devastating results. Of course a great victory has positive effects on the next missions.Every turn the player plans the actions of his units and tries to defeat his enemy. The complexity of the game mostly comes from the many different units and weapons - everything has their use and weaknesses. It is vital to use the resources in the correct order and combination. There are also other factors to think about, e.g. fuel. Allied General tries to be player friendly by giving feedback during turns, e.g. by showing the probable combat result before the player issues the attack. He can also undo a turn as long as no new enemy units are scouted. Other extras are historical film material and optional combat animations.</desc>

Special fruits give the power to kill all enemies within a short amount of time. Some differences exist from other Pac-Man variants. Each maze is larger than a single screen and slightly more complex in design. The game also offers multiple types of enemies: plasma-rookies, death-hunters, ant-lipus, and plasma-pros, each moving at a different speed. There are also stationary guns that shoot lasers the player has to watch out for. The player can shoot at the enemies on the other hand. For each ten fruits he collects he gets one shot. He has to be careful about the hunters though, since they become faster when respawning after being shot.</desc>

Each level consists of a couple of smaller micro-levels and is set in an iconic location within the States, such as Alcatraz or Las Vegas, and has its own specific enemies. The goal on each level is to rescue one of the monsters.While moving between levels, you take part in a crazy minigame where you control Joey's car as he drives towards the next area.

		<desc>ArtRageous! is a series of games and other interactive learning activities centered around art history. The learning adventure begins in a virtual plaza where the player/student can choose from a number of destinations to visit. Among the destinations are sizable, cross-referenced databases of both paintings and painter biographies.The main attraction of Artrageous! is the rich variety of activities present. The activities cover 5 categories of understanding and appreciating art: Color, light, perspective, composition, and the life of art. The color category includes a color mixing game in which you must use varying amounts of red, blue, and yellow components to build a hue/saturation color wheel. Another activity demonstrates the effect of adjusting the brightness or contrast of a picture. These and other activities are supplemented with narrated explanations of color concepts.The activities covering light include a sphere with lights placed around it-- click on one of the lights to understand the visual effects of different light sources. Also, a game that explains light demonstrates how outlines create shape. The player's goal is to match a number of outlines to their respective images within a mish-mash painting.One of the perspective category games is to arrange a roomful of floating objects where they would fit more appropriately on the painting backdrop. Both the painting and the objects are drawn with a 3D perspective which gives the player clues about placement. Further, the player can elect to bring up a vanishing point line grid for help.The composition section demonstrates how elements of paintings convey meaning. One game that illustrates this concept asks the player to match which shape or concept (circle, triangle, balanced scale, or unbalanced scale) best represents each of a selection of paintings.The life of art category features a jigsaw puzzle game using square pieces. The player must re-assemble the puzzle in a given period of time.</desc>

		<desc>Awesome Animated Monster Maker is a children's creative play computer video game program on CD-ROM, produced by ImaginEngine and published by Houghton-Mifflin's interactive Division in 1994. It was one of the first pieces of software made for young children, especially in the 2-5 age range. In Monster Maker, users create a monster by sticking together animated parts. Each part has several states to it: happy, sad, angry, etc. When a monster is happy or sad, all of its various parts animate together in the new state. Once a monster is created, one can play a variety of games and activities with it, such as making music, getting clothing and accessories, or printing it out. Monster Maker was designed for creative play, like a paint program. There were no overarching goals other than to have fun. Shortly after the first version, ImaginEngine released a follow-up called the Ultra Edition. It added four mini-games one can play with a monster, including judo and a water skiing race.</desc>

There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation.

The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels.

		<desc>Not much can be said about this game, really.
It is a two-player battle to the finish with hamsters. There are no endings, no other backgrounds besides the one pictured, and only one character (the other shown is just a recolor). One repetitive song is all there is for background music. A few cheesy sound effects make up the voice portion of the game. Special moves are few in number and only involve holding the down key and pressing an attack button. The only thing this game is really good for is its cuteness. If you like 'cutesy' fighting games, this one's for you. Otherwise, I recommend you keep looking.</desc>

		<name>Battle Sat</name>
		<desc>Battle Sat is a shareware clone of the classic Battleship board game. However, here the conflict has left the oceans and has instead gone to the skies above.The player takes turns against the computer's AI in a race to destroy the opponent's Sats (or Satellites). Gameplay is very similar to the classic Battleship - There are three grids on the screen: The left grid shows your opponent's playfield and tells you if you've hit one of his Sats, or if you missed. The middle grid allows you to choose what area you will attack during your turn. The right grid displays your own Sats, their status, and the places where the opponent has already attacked. This continues until one side loses all their Sats.The main difference between the Battleship board game and this Windows-based implementation is that there are five Sat pieces in play, all different sizes. While the board game has two pieces that are two blocks in size, this version contains one piece that's two blocks in size, and one piece that's one block in size.</desc>

		<desc>This is a shareware version of the classic board game Battleship by Milton Bradley.

Two players have a grid of boxes. You use your mouse to decide where your ships should go, and compete to try to find and sink your opponents ships.

There is a win record menu that tells how many time you won and lost or drew. Options include whether the game has a 10 x 10 or 15 x 15 board, and allow you to choose between a single shot or salvo shooting, and whether you can use Cluster bombs, Cruise missiles and Smart Bombs, and you can use Ship resources or Fleet resources. There are Beginner, Intermediate or Expert skill levels, and you can decide who goes first, with the option of this being decided randomly.</desc>

		<desc>BattleStar is basically a Battleship-variant for one player. The player controls a space ship which needs to kill all Zilog ships on the 8x8x8 game field. The game shows only one perspective at the time but by using one of the three scanners the perspective shifts and it also says how many enemy ships are on he chosen axis. Just like in Battleship he doesn't know where these ships exactly are. He has to aim his airship's gun to a certain coordinate - if he hits an enemy ship, it gets destroyed. The position also gets marked so he doesn't shoot the same field twice. The Zilog ships don't shoot back - the difficulty are the limited fuel and rocket reserves which are reduced with every movement respectively shot. There are overall three difficulty settings.</desc>

		<name>Beauty and the Beast: Memorex Children's Series</name>
		<desc>Improve your child's reading and vocabulary skills with Memorex Classic Tales, designed by child development experts. Journey back to a story retold in the classic tradition of Charles Perrault and the Brother's Grimm. Carry on the tradition of the highly valued, original tales passed from generation to generation. The story is told in considerably greater depth than the Disney version of a few years back, primarily because there's so much text and (therefore) so many more details. It is this preponderance of text – whether you're reading while listening to narration in "storybook mode", or just listening to narration in "movie" mode – that is the disc's greatest strength and fatal weakness. The simple, mostly black-and-white drawings and the pathetic excuses for animation (a flag that moves back and forth between two positions, to simulate waving in a breeze, is by no means a "movie") are disposable fluff. This storybook is really about using the computer, very straightforwardly, to read the story aloud while letting kids follow along. There's also some hypertext, offering words that will be briefly defined when clicked on.</desc>

In each cell are pieces of road or track which the player can rotate by clicking on them. The contents of the cells changes with each replaying of a level. The game starts with the beetle being positioned in one cell, from that point the player has six seconds before the game starts. The objective of the game is to keep the beetle moving for as long as possible. Points are scored for each cell the beetle passes over, specific cells that score bonus points and, in later levels, there are special bonus paths. The player must attain a predefined level in order to progress to the next. The game can be speeded up and the when that happens the point scores are doubled.</desc>

		<name>Betrayal in Antara</name>
		<desc>Betrayal in Antara uses an updated version of the game engine from Betrayal at Krondor. However, it does not continue the Raymond E. Feist's Riftwar saga, but instead starts a new tale set in a different fantasy world, known as Ramar.The story begins with William Escobar, the son of the governor of Pianda, sailing home to meet his fiancee. The ship is attacked by pirates, and William escapes in a life boat with a mortally wounded traveler. Before he dies, the stranger gives William a medallion, warning him of a conspiracy against the Empire. William meets a young magician named Aren, who has just discovered devastating powers within himself, and the two decide to meet William's father and ask for his advice concerning the unsettling information.The game plays very similarly to Betrayal at Krondor. The player navigates a party of three characters through the 3D world. Enemy encounter triggers a separate battle screen, on which player-controlled party and the enemies engage in turn-based combat. Cities are usually displayed as still pictures, with various locations accessible via menu-based navigation. Like in Betrayal at Krondor, there are only two character classes in the game, warrior and mage. The skill system is also nearly identical; skills are improved by repeatedly using them, and marking them in the skill menu for faster learning. Elements like a day/night cycle, weapon and armor repairing, navigation on world map, the necessity to carry rations, etc. are also brought over from the earlier  Dynamix game.</desc>

Your PC deals the cards and arranges the game, making complex variations or draw and stud poker easy to learn and play. While anyone can learn to play poker, to play well requires a balance of wits and guts. That's why eight different characters are included with Bicycle Poker, all dying to separate you from your chips.

Draw Poker:
This familiar form of poker offers beginners and experts alike a chance to hone their skills in the basics. On line rules list the priority of hands and a handy table displays the play for each player in each hand of the game. Once you have mastered the five-card draw, add some wild cards and see how they affect the odds, or try your hand at Stud Poker.

Stud Poker:
In contrast to Draw Poker, Stud Poker is the game that truly tests the mettle of players. Available in five, six, and seven-card variations, Stud Poker allows you to gauge the strength of your opponents' hands, but also leaves the game open to bluffing. With only one ''Hole-Card,'' five-card stud involves more skill, bluffing and guile than five-card draw.</desc>

		<name>Brain Games For Windows</name>
		<desc>Brain Games For Windows contains seven puzzle games bundled together. The games included are: Achi - You play against the CPU. The game is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe; however, if a stalemate occurs, each player can move one of their tiles and possibly get a game-winning line. Bastille - The object of the game is to remove buttons from the game board. You do so by moving one button over another; you can only jump over one button at a time, and the place where you land has to be empty. The game includes five different button patterns, each one more difficult than the last. Battle Sat - Originally released as a standalone game, this is a Battleship clone where you must shoot down your opponents Satellites before he shoots down your own. The game plays exactly like Battleship - you select points in a grid and fire at them. If you land a hit, the point will turn red, and you'll have a clue as to where the enemy's Satellites are located. The player who destroys the enemy's Satellites first wins. Double Block - This is a simple Memory game. You have to uncover tiles and match them before your opponent does so you can win the game. You can change the opponent's skill level and the colors used in the grid; a single player mode is also available. Jumper - A simple puzzle game, you have to move the red blocks on the right side to the left side of the screen. The blocks will only move if there is an empty space next to it, or if you've moved a block right next to it. Knight - The object of the game is to swap the position of the Red Knights (on top) with the Blue Knights (below) in 16 moves by using nothing but knight moves. Tic-Tac-Toe - The classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Place Xs or Os in a line across, down or diagonally before your opponent does the same.</desc>

It also has two choices of boards &amp; pegs, several types of music and a range of in-game sounds.The second game is 3-D Hex which is a two player strategy game played on a hexagonal grid.

		<name>BrainWave</name>
		<desc>Brainwave is a single player shareware game that is a sort of cross between  Space Invaders  and Galaxian.Though it looks like a space shoot 'em up the premise for the game is  much closer to home. Nanobots have been surgically implanted into the player's brain to repair damage caused by watching too much television.  However as they went about their work the nanobots achieved intelligence of their own and in order to survive they are now feeding on the player's brain.  The good news is that the player's imagination has created a ship that will destroy the nanobots and so the battle commences.There are nine scenarios in the full game with three being made available in the shareware release. This is a keyboard controlled game with the arrows moving the ship left / right  and the space bar firing the ship's weapon. These is no up/down movement. Once a wave of nanobots has been cleared the game displays the player's score before presenting the next wave which the game claims to configure by analysing  the player's game style.  Some nanobots leave a power crystal behind that, if captured, upgrades the players weapons.The game has sound, music, a high score table and re-definable keys.</desc>

It is a sequel to Dexterity Software's  BrainWave.Once again nanobots are attacking the player's brain and the player's imagination has created a ship with which to fight them.  Like its predecessor this is a keyboard controlled game with the arrows moving the ship left / right  and the space bar firing the ship's weapon. These is no up/down movement.When a wave of nanobots has been cleared the game displays the player's score before presenting the next wave. Destroyed enemy ships leave behind power crystals which, if collected, can be used to buy power ups such as more effective weapons, shields and special features before the next wave commences.  With each successive level the enemy ships also evolve, getting power ups of their own making them harder to hit and giving them better weapons. The player starts with three lives, new lives are added for every 300,000 points scored. When a life is lost all the crystals that have been collected are lost. The full game has three scenarios, only one of which is available in the shareware release. Some weapons and features are also available only in the registered release.</desc>

		<name>Capitalist Pig</name>
		<desc>Capitalist Pig is one of the most fun - and the most obscure - business simulations released in the early 1990s. In this innovative game that foreshadows Capitalism Plus years later, your job is to start a company from scratch and build it to a conglomerate.
The game is more focused on the operational level of running a business, similar to Free Enterpri$e, than the strategic level of Capitalism Plus. The first thing you need to do is fill an empty building space with various departments: administration, marketing, and so on. Then, hire employees, launch the products, and watch the cash roll in. Of course, like real life, things do not always go as planned, and there are many random events to keep things interesting. These events range from macroeconomic news and world events, to company-specific accidents like a break-in and fire (for which you can buy insurance). You will also face the risk of embezzlements by employees you thought were worthy, grueling tax audits, and even terrorist attacks. One of the nicest touches are the historically accurate world events from 1901 and 1991 that are built into the model. Colorful animation, crisp cartoony graphics, and realistic sound effects add to the fun. The mouse-driven interface is also a breeze to learn, and the difficulty is about right. Definitely one of the most underrated games of its kind, Capitalist Pig is recommended to all business game enthusiasts. Two thumbs up!</desc>

		<name>Caribbean Stud Poker</name>
		<desc>Masque Caribbean Stud Poker is an officially licensed simulation of a casino card game for 1 - 4 players where either the computer or real people can take the role of players 2,3 &amp; 4.  The game starts with each player placing a bet or "Ante" in the treasure chest lid area of the table. The cards are then dealt, all the player(s) cards are dealt face down but the top card of the dealers hand is placed face up. Each player in turn decides whether their hand will beat the dealers. If the player thinks there's a chance of beating the dealer they choose to bet on their hand which causes chips to the value of the original bet to be transferred from their stack to the table. If the player does not think they can beat the dealer then they fold and lose their original bet. The dealer then reveals their cards and players who have beaten the dealer are paid.  A feature of this version of poker is that the dealer must have an Ace and a King or better in their hand in order to qualify, if they do not have this minimum requirement in their hand then the dealer loses and anyone still in the game, regardless of what is in their hand, will win.  Winnings are based the strength of a players hand with two pairs paying out double the bet and four of a kind paying twenty times the bet. In addition there is a progressive bonus payout for hands that contain a flush or better.The game allows the player to change various settings such as the speed of the deal, the minimum &amp; maximum bet and to set automatic reminders for the progressive bet and other gaming situations. It also includes a CD player so that the player can listen to their own music during the game.The game can be played entirely with the mouse, bets being made by dragging &amp; dropping chips onto the table or by clicking on the stack. Alternatively the game can be played entirely via the keyboard or by a combination of the two.  There are no save game feature or network play features in this game.</desc>

Forty-nine cards are dealt into seven stacks of seven cards. The first four stacks are dealt face up, the remainder have three cards face down and four cards face up. Cards can be moved between the stacks either singly or on blocks, the only rule being that the card selected must be placed on a card of the opposite colour and one higher in rank - so a seven of hearts could be placed on the eight of spades for example. An empty stack can only be filled by moving a king into it.The object is to transfer all the cards to the foundations building from ace to the king, the author states that with practice this can be achieved in around one hand in three.The game has no undo feature, no hint feature, and is played entirely with the mouse</desc>

		<name>Chuck Jones: Peter and the Wolf</name>
		<desc>Letting legendary Warner Bros. animator Chuck Jones try his hand at CD-ROM animation is a little like asking Eric Clapton to let rip on a ukulele. The genius who helped create the Road Runner and some of Daffy Duck’s career highs here illustrates the Prokofiev kiddie classic, with voices provided by Kirstie Alley and Lloyd Bridges. But while Jones’ Chuck Jones’ Peter and the Wolf has a certain paranoid Wile E. Coyote charm, the limits of computer memory make for jerky movement and overly long pauses. An excellent learn-about-the-orchestra section is marred by kludgy text-scrolling, and I’m not sure what Prokofiev would have made of the ”Log Jam Game,” in which the user helps Peter cross a river by moving him from log to log (has Jones been watching Ren &amp; Stimpy?). This is a fine amusement for kids, but you’ll want them to listen to the audio CD that comes with it, if only so they can experience this music unfettered by technology.</desc>

		<name>Cinema Volta</name>
		<desc>Cinema Volta is a memoir, a quirky performance piece, an ear-popping and eye-grabbing reverie about electricity and its transforming power. In twelve stories that pulsate and migrate across the screen, narrator Jim Petrillo considers the strange lives of great inventors of the nineteenth century: Alessandro Volta, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Samuel Morse, and Nicola Tesla. But don't expect a dry treatise on the history of science. Petrillo's idiosyncratic perspective takes in the history of Sicily; Shelley and Byron's shenanigans during the summer of 1816 (Byron's daughter, Ada, wrote the first computer program); Joyce's X-rated love letters to Nora (the program takes its name from a movie theater opened by Joyce in Trieste in 1909); the cave paintings of Lascaux; Frankenstein; naked people; vampires; big noise; and the artist's own childhood memories. Often ironic (electricity was first used, he notes, to make dead frogs twitch), Petrillo's commentary weaves together an arresting collage of images and text. The subtitle promises ''Weird Science and Childhood Memories.'' Weird it is, and not for everyone. But like any cult favorite, it has its fans.</desc>

		<name>Clue</name>
		<desc>Clue is a full-motion video adaptation of the popular board game of the same name. It is an amalgamation of two earlier CD-i titles where (up to six) players take turns investigating a mansion where a murder happened, uncovering clues and evidence to reveal the assassin. There are three storylines with four difficulty levels, each with a unique solution making it altogether twelve different mysteries:Deadly PatentMr.Boddy steals a formula to produce artificial rubies from Professor Plumm.The Road to DamascusMr.Boddy almost dies in a car accident. He is rescued by the monks of the Order of Silence. Upon his return, he decides to join the order and give his fortune to it.BlackmailMr.Boddy convinces all his acquaintances to invest on Bolders Brewery.The movement system, where the player moves the cursor to a portion of the screen and clicks on it to move or turn to that direction is similar to the one found in the The 7th Guest. Inside the rooms the screen switches to a 360? panorama that can be scrolled by moving the cursor to its edges. Clicking on clocks starts a flashback video of what happened on the room before the crime was committed. Clicking on suspects brings up the interrogation screen, where they can be inquired about weapons, their alibis, etc. Clicking on secret passages transports the player to another room. Clicking on the bell calls the butler and the accusation menu, where the player chooses the weapon and the murderer. Afterwards, the butler informs if the player made the right choice. A notebook keeps track of all the information collected, and can be accessed at any time.Each of the four difficulty levels have a different number of accusations available (3 on the easiest level, 1 on the hardest one). In the easier levels the room positions are fixed, while in the tougher levels they are random.In each player's turn they can perform two moves, two actions or a action and a move. A move is defined by entering and leaving a room. A action is defined by examining items, interrogating suspects or watching a flashback.</desc>

		<desc>Comic books finally get the respect they deserve. Combining interviews, historical footage, animation, and montages of comic book art, Comic Book Confidential traces the development of the comic book from the very first (Funnies on Parade), in 1933, through counterculture favorites (Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers) to the hippest representatives of the 1980s comic book revival (The Dark Knight returns). Ron Mann's witty, incisive movie in QuickTime contains interviews with influential authors and artists of commercial, alternative, and underground comics. Many read from their works: Marvel master Stan Lee brings Spiderman's money worries to life; Charles Burnes becomes Big Baby; Jack Kirby reenacts the birth of Caption America. The CD-ROM adds over 120 pages of comics by the film's featured artists. Scott McCloud, author of ''Understanding Comics'', provides new introductions. Also included are biographies of all the artists, and checklists of their published works. It all adds up to a new way to explore America's only purely indigenous art form.</desc>

		<name>Congo: The Movie - Descent into Zinj</name>
		<desc>Congo is an adventure game adapted from the 1995 movie of the same name. The plot revolves around a search for a diamond that presumably have power enough to change the world of telecommunications as we know it. On a mission issued by Travis, the head of TraviCom, you are sent in contemporary Congo in order to recover the diamond and find out what has happened to another expedition led by Dr. Karen Ross.  As you arrive at the place of you destination more and more pieces of the puzzle begin to fit together in a wholesome picture as even more  questions arise. Who are the monster gorillas populating the area? What is the meaning of all the Egyptian writings found throughout the place? What drives Amy -- a sentient gorilla capable of speech, to help you? And most importantly -- how to survive and get hold of the precious diamond and, perhaps, save the unfortunate souls of the first expedition in the process.The gameplay is that of a classical inventory-based adventure. Although occasionally the game does depart from the formula. It mostly concerns the sequences where player should operate a multi-functional device resembling a laptop. With it's use player is able to analyze visual images to gain clues, record audio, track homing signals on the map and examine additional info from the  files downloaded from the TraviCom network. Other notable gameplay features include navigating a river by boat and a maze-like sequence in the middle of the game.Visually the game is similar to the first-person adventure games of it's era tracing its roots to Myst. It contains the same pre-rendered 3D backgrounds with the smoothly animated transition sequences and the characters done in live-action, except for Amy who is also executed in pre-rendered 3D. The game is supplied with the trailer of the afore-mentioned 1995 movie.</desc>

		<desc>The object of the game is to be the first player to reach 121 points. The current point totals are shown in two different ways. The values are shown in the ''''Computer's Score'''' and ''''Player's Score'''' score box. These same values are also represented as pegged values on the cribbage board. The computer's pegs are yellow and the player's pegs are blue. The pegs always go up the outside and down the inside. If the winner reaches 121 before the opponent gets 91, this is called a skunk and is considered as two games won (and double the money). If the opponent doesn't reach 61 this is considered a Double Skunk and is quadruple(four times the money). The players obtain points by forming various counting combinations as pairs, triplets, fours, sequences and fifteens. Combinations can be formed when playing the cards, or when counting the hands and crib in conjunction with the starter card.</desc>

You are wounded, so Kat is the only person who can find the missing part, and to do so she has to enter the building that crawls with madmen led by General Minh. From the Control Room where you are hiding you can help her, so you may have a chance to survive.Critical Path is an interactive movie with action-based sequences, in which the main character Kat has to shoot, fight, set traps etc. It also has puzzle-solving elements as you, as the wounded soldier in the Control Room, have to enter codes and push buttons to help her survive. Kat starts with nine lives. When she looses a life, the player can continue with one less life or reload an earlier part of the game (automatically saved; the game has no saving slots).

		<name>Crusader: Adventure Out of Time</name>
		<desc>An historical adventure game set in the Middle Ages at the time that the Franks were beginning to be driven out of Jerusalem. The player follows the adventure of Artaud, a disgraceful French Lord, who is sent to redeem himself by traveling to the Holy Lands to escort the True Cross back to safety. This is done through a series of scenes, with narration. The player has to complete certain tasks before Artaud can progress to the next scene. These tasks are generally of an educational nature, such as learning how sieges on castles were carried out, or who the main forces in the Holy Lands were at the time. Whilst Artaud's quest is fictional (with some added supernatural events), the setting is quite real, with actual locations visited and use of historic figures.Artaud's quest will see his home in Dun-le-Roy wasted in a siege, travel across the Mediterranean to the port of Acre, and eventually to the Holy City of Jerusalem. Along the way historical information is provided on events and lifestyles of the period.The game's style has a 3rd-person perspective and uses digital footage of real actors again photo-realistic (for the time) backdrops, which are partially animated. Intertwined with the scenes is an encyclopaedia, which it is necessary to interact with in order to complete the tasks and fully understand the narrative. The structure of most of the tasks involves collecting items from the scenes and the encyclopaedia by dragging them into your inventory, and then re-arranging them on to the task screen. The game is very similar in style to 1998's Vikings.</desc>

Curious George can't seen to stay out of trouble and is immediately thrust into the middle of the learning adventures. From the main circus selection menu, there are 6 activities to choose from:  Animal Acrobats: In this activity, 3 animals trot out at a time carrying pictures. A picture is shown on a banner overhead. The player's task is to choose the animal carrying a picture that rhymes with the overhead picture, in one variation. In another variation, the player must choose the picture whose word begins with the same letter as the picture from the banner.  Fun House: A picture is shown in the middle of the house. Random people pop out of windows holding letters. When the next letter in the word comes up, the player must click it and drag it to the top of the house to assemble the word.  Comedy Clowns: A pile of clowns get mixed up and the player will have to pair them back up. One clown gets up on stage and holds a banner of an ending letter. The task is to scan through the other clowns and find the one who is holding a picture whose word ends with the same letter seen on stage. Make a match and the 2 clowns exchange a joke.  Sammy The Musical Seal: Sammy the seal plays five horns. But they don't play music until the player chooses five pictures from among eight that have a particular vowel.  Peanut Pickup: This is somewhat of a Pac-Man clone. The peanut vendors are sloppy and Curious George, riding an elephant, must clean up after them. Along the way, a peanut vendor will appear, who is carrying a picture whose first letter begins with a certain goal letter. Capture that peanut vendor for more points.  Thea's Story Theater: Choose from a variety of stories to be read, and acted out by the characters involved. Upon exiting the game, Curious George presents the player with a printable certificate stating how you performed at the various educational tasks.</desc>

		<name>Daleks</name>
		<desc>Following in the footsteps of the early UNIX game Robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier BASIC game Chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be The Doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the Daleks. They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated!

Fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him. Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid. Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him. Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map. In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited. Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks.

Other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources; more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the ''drop'' in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision. Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death. (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however.)

Some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present The Doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon. Generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.</desc>

		<desc>Who can save the citizens of Compli City from the sinister threat of mind-numbing boredom? The Dazzeloids, of course! They are: Stinkabod Lame (daredevil, prankster, slamdancer), Yendor Talbneerg (technoid supreme), and Titan Rose (muscleman and poet). Their commander is Anne Dilly Whim, out to avenge her sister's death of boredom in front of the TV. Together, they battle the Mediogre, head of the Blando Corporation and power-mad capitalist worm, and his techno-weasel sidekick, Pin Bleeper. In ''A Child is Bored'' the Dazzeloids save little Jeremy Gerbilman from brainwashed zombification (too much Blando television!). Their mission in ''Banker, Spare that Petshop'' is to rescue the smelly but lovable Probe and Poke Petshop from the void of the Mediogre's Transglumifier. The story lines change depending on which character you send to the rescue, so learn what goes on inside their heads in the music-video-inspired ''Dazzeloid Dreams.'' Dazzeloids is crammed with brilliant animation, strange poems and infectious songs, narrated text with definitions of real and made-up words, crazy sound effects, and enough absurd surprises to entertain for hours. Boredom is banished when the Dazzeloids hit town!</desc>

		<name>Deflektor PC</name>
		<desc>This early, authorized freeware remake of the puzzle game from 1987 updates the graphics and sounds while maintaining the original gameplay. Each level is a puzzle room filled with obstacles and viewed from above, where the objective is to use a series of mirrors to guide a laser beam towards a receiver device and complete the stage. The mirrors are stationary, but can be rotated to deflect the light to several directions, with some turning automatically all the time. The player must configure the mirrors and carefully avoid the mines and walls that reflect the laser back to itself, causing the emitting device to overload and explode. Bomb detonators have to be activated and destroyed to open a passage to the receiver. Other features change the behavior of the laser: the prism bends the light in random 90? angles; the optical fiber nodes act as a portals, transporting the beam to another place of the board; logical doors have internal mirrors that absorb or deflect the laser when hit at the correct orientation. This remake received a new version in 2006.</desc>

		<desc>Adventures of the smart patrol is a game basically inspired by the late seventies/early eighties alternative band Devo, and which takes us to a world based on every little thing that is Devo. You control a Monkees-style group of musicians called the Smart Patrol who take it upon themselves to stop the mad schemes of the evil mutant ''Turkey Monkey'' who wants to unleash a virus all over Spudland. Gameplay consists of a myst-like game of ''slideshows'' but without puzzles to solve, most of the game progresses through dialogue and interaction, so you mission really consists of talking to the right person at the right times.The game features digitized actors as well as multiple endings plus, of course, millions of Devo-related jokes, characters etc.</desc>

Some bricks are colored, and can only be destroyed by a similar-colored ball. Hit color-changing bricks to make this happen. Other bricks are diamond bricks, and can only be destroyed once all the colored bricks have been destroyed. There are also key and lock bricks, which function as one might expect, and magic bricks, which have unusual effects. Finally, the paddle can hold the ball in place, by using energy which is recharged whenever the ball hits the paddle. 50 levels are included, and the game is saved every 5 levels.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2442 a comet throws earth out of its orbit. It drifts towards the sun which causes almost all humans to die. Just a few could save themselves into underground bunkers. One of these people is professor Oman Tempel which has a theory that an old African native tribe had contact with aliens. Now the player uses Tempel's time machine to get the alien's knowledge to save the earth.The game is played in a 360? view where the player investigates his surroundings. The graphics are displayed as rendered stills. The puzzles mostly are small thinking puzzles which can be solved right away, e.g. to power a machine. Sometimes a item has to found at point A and brought to point B. The whole controlling of the game is handled with a menu bar on the bottom of the game. When the player goes trough a corridor he can't turn back but has to go all the way to the end.</desc>

I'd describe this as being something of a non-linear interactive storybook. Rather than it being read in a linear fashion, the game's story is decided by the player as to which order of planets they want to explore. It also includes a number of interactive activities (or minigames) which aren't essential to advance the story, but are mostly there for the sake of livening up to the game's format. So it's a storybook with some adventure gaming elements in it.</desc>

		<name>Disney's Animated Storybook: Hercules</name>
		<desc>As in other animated storybook titles, the story has been considerably condensed in order to work as a software program. Crucial details are imbedded in click-on visuals. As with other software programs of this genre, Hercules includes the Disney story told in a series of interactive scenes. This is based on the Disney Studios version of Hercules. The story tells of Hercules being born to Zeus and Hera. Due to the animosity of Hades, Hercules is stolen from his immortal parents and made mortal, though still extremely strong. He is then raised on earth by a mortal couple. Troubled by his great strength, Hercules prays to Zeus for advice and finds out that he is god-born. But, he cannot come back to Olympus until he becomes a hero. A true Hero. So, he is sent to the Satyr Philoctetes, who agrees to train him (after a little convincing from Zeus). Can Hercules become a hero? Each scene features brief text, narrated by two jive-talking Muses. Screen animation and character dialog follow. At this point the screen becomes static and the user has the opportunity to explore, clicking on objects that cause the lightening bolt-medallion cursor to change. Five activities can be accessed, including a matching game; a checkers activity; maze game; a monster-creation activity; and our reviewers' favorite, a viewing of the night sky complete with constellation discovery and descriptions. Also included in the program is a 'Sing-A-Long' section which includes three songs from the Hercules movie that can be enjoyed as sing-a-longs, or sung alone Karoke-style.</desc>

		<name>Disney's Animated Storybook: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree</name>
		<desc>Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree is the second title in the Disney's Animated Storybook series, based on the classic story from A. A. Milne. The story follows Pooh, who is out of honey and out looking for more, who eventually ends up stuck inside of Rabbit's door. His friends must pull as hard as they can to try and get Pooh out. Each page has interactive things to click on, and others have mini-games or an interactive song to go along with it. There are four mini-games in total, all of which are very simple for the age market. In the first mini-game, you must listen to Piglet and find the right toy according to his description. The next mini-game is a puzzle where you must find honey on Rabbit's shelves in order to satisfy Pooh. In the third mini-game, you must clean up Rabbit's shelves after Pooh got himself stuck and wrecked all the objects in his house. The final mini-game stars Roo, where you must catch butterflies. Each mini-game is very easy and has no difficulty level to change, which is understandable considering the age demographic is 3-6. There is no end goal to the game, it is just a simple storybook with a few minigames placed here and there to keep young children interested.</desc>

		<name>Disney's Toy Story Activity Center</name>
		<desc>Toy Story Activity Center is an educational and entertaining title, not to be confused with the other Toy Story title, the Animated Storybook.
The hybrid CD-ROM features many classic mini-games such as Five-In-A-Row, or a memory challenging game a la Simon Says, with 4 green aliens popping up out of boxes or a math card game with an Etch-A-Sketch.
Other mini-games include a Code Breaker, and, in order stimulate creativity, a music activity aka Sid's Sonic Boom Box and a build-your-own-monster activity. The icon-driven interface, at the lower-right corner of each screen is quite simple. e.g. numbers 1 to 3 let kids choose from one of the three levels of difficulty, and the printer icon is self-explanatory. Needless to say, many video clips from the film are available.</desc>

She was reading a book, until you came to her and began the conversation. The next events move you both to her apartment for certain reasons.

In this game the dots are replaced by fruits (apple, strawberry and cherry) that the player has to eat in order to get a score and to go to the next level. The enemies are four mean laser machines in the sides of the levels and they attack the player by shooting lasers. When the character is hit, a life is lost. Unlike Pac-Man there are no special pills in the game. The board also contains skulls and they also make the character lose a life upon contact. After every level a password is provided to continue playing from that level immediately.</desc>

		<desc>Dogz: Your Computer Pet is the first game entirely based on caring for a virtual pet, even before the Tamagotchis became popular. From the title screen players can choose one of the five available puppies and interact with them using the mouse. The dog can be picked up and dragged around, and it lives on the player's desktop. The dog needs to be fed and you can play with them, scold them, and teach them tricks. It is also possible to take pictures and design a playpen for them. In other applications the dog can grab your attention by holding on to the cursor, or you can throw a ball to keep it busy while doing something else.When the dog is not fed or cared for, for a long time, it dies. This concept was also used as a business incentive. The game was distributed freely, but only came with five days of food. Because without food the dog would die in the demo version, this encouraged players to pay the $20 to get the full game and an unlimited amount of food.</desc>

		<desc>Dole 5 A Day Adventures is an educational title produced in conjunction with the Dole Food Company aimed at teaching children about nutrition. This is primarily an American title, all the examples and information are geared to which US stares grow this crop or which countries in the world supply the US with that crop. The game's installation creates a program group on the player's computer with two icons one of which is the game and the other, 'Support Materials', is a set of notes for teachers on getting the most out of the product. The game itself takes place on Banana Boulevard, a street which which has five buildings on it. Each building represents a set of informational hosted by an animated vegetable of fruit, for example Pamela Pineapple hosts the show in the Adventure Theater. The buildings are:  * Adventure Theater: here the player selects a piece of produce and can then view fun facts, where in the USA it is grown, which other countries supply the USA, pictures and a short video clip  * Salad Factory: is where the player combines ingredients to make a salad and can see just how much vitamin A &amp; C, fibre and fat their creation contains.  * H.B.'s Body Shop: In the body shop the player selects parts of H.B.'s body and learns which fruit and vegetables are beneficial say for muscle growth.    * The Cook's Kitchen: Here the player selects kitchen items and is given details of appropriate recipes such as 'Carrots in the Microwave' , 'Spunky Vegetable Pizza', 'Fruity Breakfast Parfait', and 'Trees in a Broccoli Forest'   * Leafy Green Travel: this is takes the player to 'The Land of 5 A Day' where there are five more game areas.: Information Land, Pyramid Land, Label Land, Serving Size Land, and Market Land.As the player exits any location they are asked if they wish to 'Take The Challenge' which tests the player's knowledge of the information in that section.  All challenges are earn tokens which are used to complete a game board. If the player scores the maximum number of points in a section then they are certified in that area. Challenges can be retaken but the questions change each time. When all challenges have been completed successfully the game board pathway is complete and the player becomes a certified '5 a Day Kid'.From the game's menu bar the player can access and play any of the game's songs, print recipes, certificates and access a glossary of key words.The game is played entirely with the mouse, speakers or headphones are essential as all instructions are spoken.</desc>

		<name>Don Quixote: A Multimedia Storybook</name>
		<desc>This is more than the story of a man on a quest. This is the story of what it is to be human, brought to life through humor and drama, vivid illustrations, lively music and colorful narration.
In an sumptuous edition of Cervantes’ masterpiece, the adventures of the brave and chivalrous Don Quixote are told with care and grace. The CD-ROM edition captures the language, irony, and character that gave the original its prized place in Western literature.
See Don Quixote set out to rid the world of evil with his passionate devotion to honor and truth. Hear Sancho Panza faithfully attempt to teach his master to see things for what they really are. With all of the humor and pathos of Cervantes' classic, Quixote follows his courageous heart as his friends seek to bring him home. The artwork in Don Quixote is filled with humor, vigor, and the colors of the Spanish landscape. With delicacy and strength, Manuel Boix depicts the characters of the visionary Quixote and the down-to-earth Sancho, as well as the architecture and countryside of medieval Spain. Never before has the story of Don Quixote been so vividly recounted.</desc>

		<desc>Here we have an expanded version of the author's earlier Dopefish Lives! featuring two- and four-player modes, but no single-player game.  In addition to the ''fishfest'' mode, which reproduces the original game's simple schoolfish-eating game (but makes it competitive -- who can eat the most the fastest?), this game also takes a nod from the FPS revolution its parent companies spawned and features two- and four-player deathmatches (aka ''dopematch''es) where the players must line themselves up properly to eat a schoolfish precisely at the moment when they're facing an opponent, as the food quickly gets converted and expelled back out as a kind of shot.  Four dopes enter. One dope leaves. That is the dopematch law in Dopefish Forever!</desc>

		<desc>Taking its name from a secret message in Rise of the Triad, this game takes the famous ravenous green burping fish antagonist of the underwater levels of Commander Keen 4, the Dopefish, and, for the first time, takes him out beyond the role of easter egg and puts the player in charge of him.  The player swims around the screen and opens the goofy fish's gaping maw by hitting the Ctrl key... hopefully timed appropriately for when a little schoolfish might just be swimming in.  (And then... indicating its appreciation with a resounding belch.)Upon consuming a certain allotment of fishies, levels proceed, first adding coral obstacles and then exploding mines.  Still later levels feature the Sprite actively harassing the Dopefish.  After sustaining three wounds, the meal is done!</desc>

Unlike those games, these puzzles come alive after your child successfully completes them. Through the magic of multimedia, Dr. Ditto himself appears on screen to provide fun and informative explanations of the game's theme.
Dr. Ditto contains two types of games: Lotto and Memory. Each game has over 100 colorful decks. The decks are divided into categories, as shown by nine buttons on the question mark screen. To go to each category and see what the deck contains, just click on one of the nine buttons. You will be given a fun multimedia tour of the subject you have chosen and given several deck options.
Lotto: Match the card at the bottom the screen with its mate up top by clicking and dragging it up. When all the cards are matched, you win!
Memory: To find the cards that match, click on the backs of the cards to turn them over. When you find one you have seen before, click on its mate to make them both disappear. When the board is clear, you win!
Dr. Ditto encourages participation with lively lessons on history, airplanes, trucks, animals, colors, language, and more. Its pictures, puzzles, and patterns will educate and entertain. The multiple game format will keep your child's interest, even on the rainiest of days. Dr. Ditto is designed to be used by children at home, so they can help their parents share the fun. It will be a delightful learning experience for all!</desc>

Designed by Alan Snow, creator of P.A.W.S, Duck City stars a talking cartoon duck who wanders around in his cartoon world, getting into one trouble after another. In one mini-game that is similar to basketball, you will see how a duck can pull off spectacular slam dunks. In the farm, you must fatten slugs by feeding them cabbages. The barber shop is the site of one of the game's most unique games: here, you cut and dry customers' hair to make cool haircuts. In the garage, you can participate in a fun cross-country racing. And finally in a lab, you can tinker with various gadgets and interact with RoboDuck, a cross between RoboCop and a duck. All the games are simple to learn and easy to use - you need to memorize only a few keys and mouse clicks. With attractive and creative cartoon graphics, fun mini-games, and a transparent and intuitive interface, Duck City is a fun ''interactive environment'' for everyone in the family. None of the game has lasting play value, but they are ideal for a 5-10 minute coffee break at the office... or a fun evening for the kids in your house.</desc>

Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</desc>

Now he has to find a way back to the surface and discover the real purpose of this apparent tomb.The puzzles are mostly Myst-style logic puzzles on a big scale. To solve these puzzles the player has to search the tomb and perceive and understand the engravings of this old civilization. This knowledge is mostly used to put old machines into operation or deactivate deadly traps. The player quickly finds a notice book of another archaeologist who apparently already explored most of the complex. This serves as a subtle ingame help system - it doesn't give the solutions but hints to the nature of the puzzles.In 1997 it got a complete overhaul and was re-released as Entombed Enhanced.</desc>

		<name>Eyewitness Virtual Reality: Earth Quest</name>
		<desc>Earth Quest teaches you about earth science, like how minerals are formed and what the tectonic plates are, and the museum is built inside a giant cavern. It feels like you’ve stumbled into an excavation site. The doorways are carved out of stone, and the exhibits about gemstones and ores are built into the rock walls. As you walk around, you can hear water dripping. Where an actual museum might have a famous sculpture or a dinosaur skeleton in the center of the room, this museum has the earth’s core, shrunken-down, sitting on a pedestal and lighting up its surroundings.
Owing to their art experience, all of Dorling Kindersley’s CD-ROMs look terrific, but Earth Quest is especially spectacular. The museum is monumental. Even though it has a small footprint, it thinks in terms of hulking earthworks and geography. There are a few side exhibits, like a Violent Earth pavilion about earthquakes and volcanoes, and they’re presented on the edge of cliffs overlooking giant expanses of the earth. The balcony of the Shaping the Earth exhibit overlooks a view that moves between mountains, deserts, valleys, and islands to illustrate land formation. This is a museum so enormous and grandiose that the planet itself is on display.</desc>

		<name>Fast Action Paq</name>
		<desc>This collection is a set of four ''retro games'' based on fondly remembered titles from the 1980's. BOT Your mission is to prevent the Mother CPU from completing its military conquest of the planet. To succeed you'll need to pass through 5 levels of BOT soldiers shooting them at will, including a larger BOT boss at the end of every level. Try to pick up extra grenades, armor protection, and more powerful weaponry along the way to assist you in accomplishing this task. Finding the experimental lightning gun is especially helpful, since it inflicts twice as much damage on enemies as your normal gun.BUBBLE TROUBLE You control a spaceship which you must use to clear the starlanes of subspace vortices (which look like terrestrial water bubbles). You must avoid contact with these vortices and shots by your own weapons, or your energy will slowly drain away. Your ship is armed with two weapons: guns, which are weak but use up little energy; and penetrators, which are strong but use up much more energy. Ship energy is used for thrusting, subspace jumping, and conducting repairs. Shields are used for defense only, and you lose shield power when you come in contact with vortices, bullets, penetrators, saucers, or stationary energy barbs.FLAK ATTACK A horde of robot commandos are attacking your base from the skies above. You control a single gun which you must aim and fire to stop the invaders, but don't run out of ammunition, or your base will certainly be destroyed. When a robot parachutes to the ground, it will walk towards your base and stand beside it.  When 4 robots gather on one side of the base, they will destroy it, and the game will be over. The enemy ships include satellites, jets, and helicopters.  Satellites fly past at high speeds, but they cannot harm your base directly. Jets fly overhead quickly, and the pilot will eject if you fire enough shots at it. Helicopters drop parachuting robots as they pass. Friendly UN Helicopters will drop extra ammo on your base if you let them fly peacefully overhead. MOLE'S QUEST As Monty the Mole, you must rescue your belongings which the miners have scattered throughout the mines after they destroyed your beautiful home. Jump from platform to platform from the left to the right, grab the belonging, and jump back to the left to safely pass each level. Each time you save ten belongings, you will see an animation of Monty taking the rescued belongings to his new home. Since the mines are covered with radioactive ooze, you must limit your exposure to no more than 5 minutes at a time. That should be sufficient time to rescue each of your belongings. Every time you save a belonging, you will be given a password, so you can continue from the level where you stopped, even if you shut off your computer.</desc>

		<desc>Some hardware companies often published their own games in order to bundle them with their hardware (when they couldn't get enough big-name games to sign with them). This is one such product.  Forever growing garden's gameplay consists of selecting seeds, etc. and taking care of them in order to later sell your crops on the market and flowershop (were you can also make flower-arrangements, etc.) the game is aimed at kids, so everything from the interface to the objectives are kept very simple and straight-forward. Also the game is filled with hot-spots that start animations or sound effects.</desc>

		<desc>Jack Fremont is an ordinary guy with just one unique talent: his knowledge of TV shows. Otherwise, his life isn't going too well, and he is about to be evicted from his place. However, one day, bragging about his encyclopedic abilities, Jack is confronted by two CIA agents who tell him that a powerful terrorist is about to destroy Los Angeles. Apparently, the terrorist was uncredited in some TV shows and resorted to violence in protest. Now it's up to Jack to stop him and save the city.Fox Hunt is a spy comedy that heavily relies on live-action full-motion video to advance the plot. The gameplay is restricted to interludes between the movies, and features both adventure and action elements. In some places the player has to explore rooms and find items, while others are built like action sequences. There is a time limit in many of these episodes, and a few branching story arcs.</desc>

		<name>Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist</name>
		<desc>Set in the American West of the 1880s, Freddy Pharkas was one of the fastest guns in the west. However in one particular gunfight with an outlaw named Kenny he was outgunned and Freddy had his ear shot off. This traumatic experience caused Freddy to give up his pistols and enroll in the school of pharmacology. Blocking out the memories of his past, Freddy arrives in the town of Corsegold with the dream to own and run his own pharmacy. Working with the town's doctor, Freddy is able to fill prescriptions, mix concoctions and diagnose simple symptoms. Business among the townsfolk is brisk however, the good times are not to last as suddenly townsfolk are run out of town and businesses are being foreclosed and boarded up. Freddy must deal with the town's problems, and discover the larger plot, or risk having a fancy shop in an empty town and losing all his customers.

Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist is a humorous point-and-click side-scrolling adventure game from Al Lowe. As such it has many similarities to other Sierra adventure games including Leisure Suit Larry (Al Lowe's previous work) and King's Quest. Players use the action bar at the top of the screen to choose an action type that is used on locations and objects visible to the player. Freddy can walk to new locations, look at particular objects, attempt to use objects, talk to people and enter his inventory to access items that have been picked up. Like other sierra games, successful actions add to the player's score, judging the player on 1000 points.</desc>

		<name>Fury³</name>
		<desc>Terrans have won the war for the Coalition, but at a terrible price. It has unleashed the powers of the Bions, warriors bred for battle and victory. After the war ended, Bions started their own war against Humanity... And humanity managed to win again, but Earth was decimated in the process. We thought we had destroyed all the Bions, but apparently we are wrong. A few Bions have survived... and they are rebuilding on the planet named Fury... As a councillor in Council of Peace, the premier peacekeeping force, you will take the advanced fighter and repel the Bion invasion, and eventually destroy the Bion threat once and for all. Fury│ is basically a Windows adaptation of Terminal Velocity where you pilot a super fighter and kill bazillion targets from first person (default) or third-person viewpoints. The action is fast and furious, with plenty of air and ground threats plus structures to shoot. The fighter sequences are interspersed with a bit of tunnel running (inspired by Descent, no doubt) and a lot of shooting. Shoot the weapon pods to release missiles and other goodies which you can use to supplement your own ship. The game is in full 3D without the need for a 3D video accelerator, though it only supports 320x200 resolution and preferably 256 color only.</desc>

By affecting environmental conditions (oxygen, pH, hydrogen levels) and changing the gene structure itself it's possible to observe the growth of a single cell into a complex organism. Each action evokes a response from an embryo, ranging from death to unusual mutations (i.e. a simple change in chromosome chain may develop insect-like eyes).The player is a scientist who is circling the earth in a space laboratory. During the journey, a deadly virus hits earth and wipes out the entire human population in a few days. With no one left, it is the scientist's job to recreate life and control the conditions to let new embryos grow and evolve.The game is bundled with an extensive summary on genetics including such subjects as DNA Replication, Mutation, Cell Division and Cell Cycle, etc.</desc>

		<name>Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers</name>
		<desc>Gabriel Knight is a wise-cracking bookstore owner and would-be author. He is the last in a long line of Shadow Hunters, those fated to fight supernatural forces of evil. Tormented by terrifying nightmares, he must spend every waking moment scouring the side streets and back alleys of New Orleans for the key to his dark past. One day, a blood-chilling murder shocks the inhabitants of the city. The police detective assigned to investigate the crime is Gabriel's friend. In the beginning Gabriel collects evidence in hope of using the material for his new novel; but soon he finds himself personally involved in the investigation, and plunges deeper into the world of secret societies and murderous cults.

Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. Created by Jane Jensen, the game differs from Sierra's Quest games (e.g. Space Quest) by having a realistic setting and focusing (despite its supernatural elements and humor) on mature themes and detective work. In this way it is more similar to the company's earlier Laura Bow games.

The game's icon-based interface is the same as in Sierra's previous titles, with verb commands that allow interaction with the game world and its inhabitants. Though the game still has plenty of inventory-based puzzles characteristic for classic adventure, its gameplay is heavily inclined towards dialogue. Typically, Gabriel will have to interrogate other characters, choosing conversation topics and thus gradually finding clues and advancing towards the mystery's solution.

The game's locations are done in hand-painted style. The CD version of the game adds full voice-overs to the dialogues, as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.</desc>

		<desc>Gadget puts you in a strange surreal world were a comet appears to be heading for the earth. Most people dismiss this situation since apparently it won't collide with us, however a group of scientists scramble to develop a way to stop this comet. Whether they want to destroy it, divert it, or whatever is unknown however, and you are charged with the task to find out what really is going on. The game is viewed from a first person perspective and progresses as an adventure game, where the emphasis is to explore and discover rather than solve puzzles (this seems to be the Japanese concept of an adventure game) so ultimately it is not so much of a game as it is more an interactive "tour de force".</desc>

		<name>Gecko Shuffle</name>
		<desc>Gecko Shuffle is a simple game that tests one's reflexes. The player is presented with three tiles, two of which are empty and one of which has a gecko depicted on it. When the gecko is clicked, the three tiles are reversed and then re-arranged; the player then has to click on the tile which, in his opinion, is the one with the gecko. The tiles are then revealed again, and the player can see whether his guess was correct. A successful guess gives 10 points. The game can be played at one of the 10 levels - the higher the level, the faster the tiles move.There are two game modes: the ''Single Level Shuffle'', where the player chooses the level he wishes to play on, and has an opportunity to make 20 guesses (correct or not) before the game ends; and the ''Progressive Level Shuffle'', which is based on the same rules, but the level increases with each successful guess and decreases with each failure.After each guess, the player can see an instant replay of the tiles re-arranging, but in slow motion and with the tiles revealed.</desc>

		<desc>The idea of the game is to line up enough Gems of the same color in a row to earn a Drop.

Use the keyboard to rotate the Gems, and move them over so that the colors line up. They can line up horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. When they line up, they clear and the Gems above them fall in their place. Now those may clear too. You will see some incredible chain reactions if you place the Gems just right.

Each level has a different Threshold, which you can see at the top right of the screen. Each level also has a Not Threshold, which lets you know how many Gems to line up to earn a Not.

Nots let you use special effects. These help clear Gems that are on the board.

When you've earned enough Drops, you can advance to the next level. There are 100 levels in all.</desc>

		<desc>Charles Schultz's famous and lovable comic strip characters come to life as the Peanuts gang teams up to help children learn vocabulary, spelling, and reading through a variety of letter -- and word-related activities. By spending a day in the life of Charlie Brown, children can learn new words, practice spelling, create sentences and stories, read comics, and play games with the Peanuts kids. An intuitive user interface, coupled with top-notch music and animation, makes it fun to use. Its activities, like Hangman and the Spelling Bee, may seem like old standbys, but the title presents them with an entertaining, Peanuts-style twist. More important, they are challenging and effective at improving spelling and vocabulary. While no one will view the integrated dictionary as a substitute for a full-featured multimedia dictionary, its entries are all first vocabulary words and the program fosters its use. The game is recommended for ages 4 to 8. It has 3 levels of difficulty, and there's integrated into the program an illustrated, 1,000-word dictionary.</desc>

Obtaining and retaining the interest of sponsors and engine manufacturers is a crucial challenge as the years go on.Once the race weekend comes around, you must make the best use of practice and qualifying sessions, as well as preparing a pit strategy and being ready to adjust it if incidents, weather or unexpected performance issues occur. The action is viewed from overhead, with full commentary.There are also 5 Challenges, which set you a specific task based on one changed variable (such as bank balance, driver skill and engine supply).</desc>

		<name>Great Myths &amp; Legends Volume 1: Monsters &amp; Mythical Creatures</name>
		<desc>Come face to face with the terrible monsters and strange creatures of myth and legend: the Yeti, Minotaur, Loch Ness Monster, Cyclops, Leviathan, Pegasus, Golem, Unicorn, Gorgons, and Phoenix. The CD-ROM is supposed to be an authoritative look at the history and origins of these beasties. Includes: virtual 3D environments for each creature, 3D animation, video, narration, color illustration and original and historical documents. It begins in a castle with four doors, two of which are designed to take you to the sections on "Legendary Lands and Lost Cities" and "Legendary Heroes and Villains" available as further volumes in the series. When you get to the end of the corridor, you find yourself outside with several glowing gems embedded in the terrain. Clicking on one will take you to a section on one (or more) of the monsters. It takes a bit of stumbling around to discover which creature is tied to which gem. After you've gathered all your information about a creature, the game treats you to an animation of what it was supposed to look like. The music is appropriately ominous, the graphics are beautifully detailed (you'll need to know how to switch your monitor to at least 32,000 colors) and narrator Patrick Floersheim, dressed as a monk, is appropriately hammy.</desc>

		<desc>Green Thumb Cards is a virtual version of an actual card game.  Four players (up to 3 of which can be played by the computer) take cards featuring flowers, garden pests, helpful tools and random acts of nature.  Players try to obtain complete sets of flowers by taking cards from the stack, stealing cards from another player, or picking up cards out of the center walkways.  For example, it takes 4 roses to complete the rose set.  Once a player has successfully planted all cards of a set in their garden, they have earned the points for that set and can no longer lose those cards.  Other players can steal cards by using a pest card.  Pests can be defended against by using the appropriate defense card.  The player who has earned the most points when all cards have been used is the winner.  Game featured net play as well as offline play.</desc>

On arcade mode you have the usual 3-stage power bar for your swing. While on simulation mode you just click whenever you want the ball to go and your golfer swings. The trick is on simulation mode: 40 editable statistics are taken into account for the accuracy, power, etc of the swing. So depending on how you have customized your golfer you'll have a good long-range game, but be weak in the wet, etc..Graphics consist of mostly digitized photo-realistic images.</desc>

		<desc>This was the first game release targeted specifically to girls. Its designer was Trina Roberts, a writer for Barbie Comics and designer of Wonder Woman. The game was not successful, probably due to the low budget accorded such a ground-breaking project. It was followed, however, by four or five other games targeted towards girls, and it did introduce some of the features that would dominate the girls' games movement discussed in this volume: more character-centered plots, issues of friendship and social relationships, and bright colorful graphics. The two protagonists are 14-year-old students of Hawaii High, one native, one just moved from New York. They meet and make friends, and the girl from New York learns all about Hawaii in the course of the adventure, which involves a stolen tiki that they find and that they try to bring back, and in the course of doing that they discover an ancient Hawaiian burial and have to deal with two thieves who are bad guys, but kind of wacky bad guys, and wind up on the slopes of a volcano, surrounded by flowing lava, and meet mysterious creatures like the ghostly kahuna who is guardian of the burial cave.</desc>

Now think about it for a minute. If the reading material isn't interesting, if it isn't relevant... to kids... how will they learn the difference between knowing what a sentence says and what it means?

That's the problem NFL Reading tackles.

Packed with passages featuring real pro football facts and stats, this game lets kids - playing against each other or the computer - pick their favorite NFL teams. They call a play, then read a passage.

How well they answer determines how well their team does in a 3D photo-realistic football game that gives reading skills a real workout.</desc>

		<name>Hearts for Windows</name>
		<desc>Hearts is a card game. At the end of the game, the player with the lowest score wins. Your goal in each hand is to avoid winning any 'tricks' including a heart or the Black Maria (aka the Queen of Spades), or to gain all 13 hearts and the Black Maria. Hearts for Windows allows for 1 to 4 human players but is always a 4 player game either filled by human players or computer players. The only drawback to more than one person playing is all the human players cards are displayed on one screen, allowing for each player to see each others cards. The program allows for custom rule variations such as the Jack of Diamonds are worth -10 points, etc... The computer players randomly say silly comments.</desc>

		<desc>High Command is a tactical strategy game. The game field, which looks a lot like Minesweeper, is divided into squares. Each square is either neutral, hostile or belongs to you. Some squares are cities which have a high point value. Your goal is to reach as much points as possible by conquer the enemy's squares and cities. Similar to the board game Risk you have to move soldiers from a bordering square into the hostile square to seize it. But there is a catch: Not only the number of your and the enemy's troops in a square affect the chances - the troops in the bordering squares have a strong influence of the combat outcome too.The game features three enemy AIs (aggressive, defensive and balanced), five historical and fictional scenarios. and an editor to build your own or random scenarios. The maximum number of war parties are 4, AI or human. In the shareware version you aren't allowed to save and there is only one scenario available.</desc>

		<desc>Although Sierra tried its hand (no pun intended) at other card games, this is their first foray into the world of poker.  The game offers all the excitement of a real poker game mixed with Sierra's unique brand of humour.The game offers a total of 20 variations on popular poker games including: Texas Hold 'Em, Omaha, Omaha Hi/Lo, High Chicago, Cincinnati, Baseball, 5 Card Stud, 7 Card Stud, 7 Card Stud Hi/Lo, Jacks or Better, Criss Cross, Dealers Choice, 5 Card Draw and 5 Card Draw Lo-ball.In single-player offline mode, you can select up to 7 opponents to play against, each with their own personality, playing style and skill level.  The animated AI characters are well done and if you study them carefully, you can figure out each player's tell, which gives away the fact that they have a good hand.  The Attitude Meter adjusts the speed of the game; setting it higher results in more animation and comments from the AI players, whereas setting it lower, keeps them quiet and offers a faster pace game.  You start with a bankroll of $1,000 in case with another $9,000 in your bank account which you can access via an ATM (it also has a personality of it's own).Once you've mastered the game (or become tired of the AI players),  check out the on-line play mode and see how your skills match up with real players from around the world.</desc>

Sound effects (shuffling and dealing cards) can be heard in either the Hard Drive or CD version. It plays in all versions of Windows released thus far, from Windows 3.x through Windows XP. Most of the gameplay is ''drag and drop'' but playing a card in some of the games simply requires a right click to send it to the correct spot. Easy and Difficult settings can be chosen per game and you can undo moves as often and as far back as you desire.Options allow you to replay the current game from the beginning, choose backgrounds, music and card decks. Up to 4 players can save their statistics separately.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones and his Desktop Adventures</name>
		<desc>Indiana Jones is an archaeologist and adventurer, searching the globe for hidden treasures and lost artifacts. Towards this end, Indiana Jones has arrived in Mexico during the 1930s. Although the people living in the town of Lucasio are friendly, others such as Nazis, desperados and dangerous creatures are not so much. Indiana must use his skills to accomplish his objectives and retrieve treasured objects.Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures is an action/adventure game, seen in top-down view. Players control Indiana Jones as he collects items, attempts to solve all the puzzles and defeat his enemies in order to complete the mission. Indiana primarily uses his whip, but may also pick up a pistol or other weapons to use against foes. Indiana has a health meter on screen and will die if it drops to zero.The design of the game is meant to be casual gaming and is simplified to give the player quick experiences. Upon beginning a game, the player chooses the size of the game world (and indirectly the length of time it will take to complete). The game world, all the characters, items, and Indiana's mission are then randomly generated. Individual locations, such as the town of Lucasio may remain the same, however the path to and from those areas may change considerably.</desc>

The main challenge is that an automated security device is chasing you down, and must be avoided and ultimately destroyed. A delay between your commands and the robot's receipt of them forces you to pay close attention to the security drone and plan several steps ahead.As you explore the ship, you will find data ports, which can be jacked into to gain information or to open doorways. To access most of these, you will need to find and collect a DNA sample from a member of staff whose role gave him/her access.</desc>

Music plays in the background to provide atmosphere, but it can be turned off, if it gets repetitive. The basic layout is a hexagon around an Oracle's well. There are three doors on the outside of the hexagon, and the first one is where you begin the game. In each room is a puzzle you have to solve to get a jewel which must be taken back to the Oracle's well.The puzzles in this game can be compared to those found in The 7th Guest.  The Chinese Checkers puzzle in Shivers rivals many of the ones contained in Jewels of the Oracle.</desc>

		<name>JezzBall</name>
		<desc>Borrowing certain gameplay conventions from Qix, JezzBall presents another scenario forcing the player to divide and conquer a 2D playfield by whittling away slivers of it until it is at only 25% (or less) of its original size.The complicating factor here are balls, more with every level, bouncing off the edges of the continuous playfield and, incidentally, quite lethal to the player's marker, only tangible while in the act of diminishing the playfield by marking off areas no longer to be used.  The player can choose to trim horizontal or vertical segments -- depending on which axis they expect the bouncing ball to intercept soonest -- and the boring apparatus used fires off in opposite directions simultaneously, meaning the cross-section generally starts being cut from the middle and works its way toward the outside edges... all while keeping an eye on how close those balls are bouncing.The apparatus is slow, and until the entire cross-section is completed, its entire span is at risk of being hit.  The two sides of the dividing sweep are independent from each other, so if one side is intercepted by a ball while in the process of trimming, the other side continues unabated, resulting in a half-complete division.This game became famous after being distributed as part of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack 4 of Windows 3.x games, returning in the Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack.</desc>

		<name>Johnny Mnemonic</name>
		<desc>Johnny Mnemonic is based on William Gibson's short story and a subsequent movie of the same name. The game's plot bears more similarities to the movie than to the original story. Johnny is a courier in a futuristic society, delivering data implanted in his brain. However, the latest delivery is so big that it can kill him if he doesn't download the data. Unfortunately, the only person who knew the password is dead, and members of the Yakuza are hunting for the data and for its living container.The game consists of live-action video footage and interactive sequences, some of which play like adventure game segments and may contain simple puzzles, while others are more action-oriented. Johnny's bodyguard Jane often handles the fighting episodes; the player can assign buttons to punches and kicks. The adventure parts contain limited exploration and interaction with the environment, and mostly serve to advance the plot.</desc>

		<desc>Cover-Up at Roswell is an adventure game based on the Jonny Quest animated television series. Over 50 minutes of footage of the show from various episodes was used to construct a new story as a game, along with a number of new sequences. The story details the Roswell incident where an alien UFO crashes into the earth. General Tyler and his Men in Black immediately salvage the wreckage, but a number of alien components has been scattered around the globe. Players guide the Quest team, consisting of Jonny, Jessie and Hadji, to keep the components out of the hands of Tyler and the genius Jeremiah Surd.The characters are guided through different scenes all around the world. They can be moved around, choose an item, grab it or hold it. The five alien objects need to be found using a tracking device that pin-points the location on a GPS. This takes the team to the Devil's Triangle, New York, Peru, Tanzania and Utah. Next to the main gameplay and cut-scenes, there is a large number of mini-games such as matching sequences, board games, rafting, shooting rats with a slingshot, jeep driving, fire extinguishing, and many more.Certain segments of the game were designed in 3D and Chromatek plastic viewing glasses were provided with the game to view these.</desc>

		<name>Jump: The David Bowie Interactive CD-ROM</name>
		<desc>Where Prince Interactive takes hours to finish and attempts to offer a career overview, Bowie's CD-ROM skips the ch-ch-changes and rehashes videos and songs from his 1993 Black Tie White Noise album. After the opening credits, you enter an elevator and walk down the corridors of a gray office building matching the set for the music video ''Jump They Say''. You are given a choice of entering three rooms: the David Bowie suite, the video suite or Room 2901. Inside the David Bowie suite is an office with desk, filing cabinet and chair. By clicking a camera sitting on the desk, you hear a 10-minute audio interview with shallow off-the-cuff commentary from Bowie, illustrated with photographs from a recording session. Clicking a briefcase on the floor launches an equally unsatisfying 10-minute video interview. Room 2901 contains a telescope. Looking through the telescope, you enter rooms in a hotel across the street to watch four music videos: ''Jump They Say,'' ''Black Tie, White Noise,'' ''Miracle Goodnight'' and ''You've Been Around.'' The videos play in a window filling an eighth of the screen and look almost as good as MTV. Inexplicably, the hotel rooms contain little hidden surprises that seem to have wandered onto the disk from some children's game - click on a dog, for example, and it barks; click on a bowling trophy, and a bowling ball rolls across the floor. The video suite puts you at the controls of a video-editing machine where you create a customized version of ''Jump They Say.'' The creativity is strictly limited, however, to selecting from five video tracks playing simultaneously, designating one to display on the main screen.</desc>

		<name>Jump Raven</name>
		<desc>Jump Raven is the second title released by Cyberflix. The game is set in New York in an undefined period in the 21st century. All wildlife appears to be extinct as man has scorched the entire earth with war. Before it was too late, all animals' genetic code has been stored in biodiversity pods to bring them back safely when the ecosystem has recovered. However, a gang steals the pods and the Environmental Security Agency (ESA) brings in bounty hunter Raven to return them and preserve the animals' future.Building on the technology of Lunicus, in Jump Raven the character Raven uses a hovercraft to move around the city. The game starts in a command center where the player can read up on the events that led to the global disaster, outfit the vehicle with different types of weapons, and interview candidates for the position of co-pilot in the hovercraft (Nikki, Chablis, Limbaugh, Thrash, Lark or Dogstar). Their in-game comments bring a different atmosphere to the gameplay.While flying, there are three boroughs to search for pods: The Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The hovercraft can be moved around, it can switch between a hover and a fly mode, and players need to aim and fire weapons. As that is too much for the player to handle, tasks can be delegated to the AI co-pilot. When the pods have been found, a boss character guarding the exit needs to be taken out.While playing, the game area takes up only half of the screen. The rest is reserved for incoming video messages (including taunting opponents), general options, weapon selection, a radar, a compass, and basic statistics about ammo, fuel, shields, the pods and cash. While searching the cities, targets such as jets, sleds, helicopters, tanks and armoured cars need to be engaged. When low on fuel, shield power or weapons, the fuel truck, weapons lady (in a helicopter) and the repair bay can be visited.</desc>

It appears that the evil Sir Sournote has soured all the music; Hopsalot must travel throughout the Land of Music collecting all the ruined notes in his bag, and bring them to the Concert Hall to sweeten them again.The interface is point and click on the map screen (simply moving the mouse on the screen will cause Hopsalot to follow; click to enter a game) and in the mini-games, with the addition of certain keyboard keys: spacebar in the rhythm games, left and right sides of the keyboard and the enter key in the Jam With Cool Cat game.As you move Hopsalot around the Land of Music map, you'll find these activities:   Music Monkey ? view a short piece of music and listen to it, then find the notes that Sir Sournote has replaced with sour ones  Gorilla, Goat and Hippo ? Listen to a character play a rhythm and then play it back using the spacebar  Young Girl ? Listen to Melody play sounds, then repeat them; play your own music on the bridge and hear it played back   Musical Instruments ? these instruments have lost their voices; choose the bird that sounds like each instrument to replace it  Cool Cat ? Jam with Cool Cat in free play using the keyboard, then play it back by clicking the gramophone  After successfully playing an activity, Hopsalot  is given the opportunity to collect some sour notes in his bag ? the cursor becomes a grasping hand and you must catch the notes as they dart around the screen in a mini arcade game. On each map screen, although the activities remain basically the same the difficulty level is increased, for example, instead of finding the voice for one instrument you will have two; the number of beats you have to follow in a rhythm game will increase, as will the number of sour notes to find in a piece of music. Once you have collected all the sour notes in an area it glows red on the map, so you know how much you've done. In addition, clicking on the music note on the bottom right of the screen brings up the options, where you can click on Hopsalot's bag to see how many sour notes have been collected.When all the sour notes are collected and brought to the Concert Hall to be sweetened, Hopsalot presents you with a Sweet Note award that can be printed.</desc>

		<name>JumpStart Pre-K</name>
		<desc>Jump Start Pre-K follows (in age-range) and builds on the skills learned in Jump Start Preschool in Knowledge Adventure's lineup of learning games created for each grade and age-group. In this game for the 3 - 5 year old, the player is taken to  the colorful main page: a town map full of clickable icons leading to activities and song. Each activity begins at the easiest level, and can be adjusted manually, or the game will automatically adjust as the player responds with correct answers. All actions are point and click and there are many clickable places on the map and in each area that produce animations. As the player progresses through an area, correct answers will earn him stars, and four stars give him a chance to pick an object (trees, playground equipment, characters) to place in the town park named for him. The areas to explore are:   Carousel - Clicking the number on the carousel that matches the number of balloons the mouse holds lets the mouse climb aboard  Bakery - the player follows verbal and pictured instruction to connect frosting dots on a cake  Airport - using onscreen arrows or the arrow keys, the player moves a plane up and down on a scrolling screen, flying through clouds with shapes that do not match a pictured shape. In free play mode, clicking the paint bucket allows the player to decorate the skies with color or patterns  Fire Station - a memory game; the player turns over objects around the station to reveal pictures and make a match  Diner - Kisha sets out food in an ordered row (dark to light, full to empty) and then mixes it up; the player must put it back into the same order  Barbershop - a musical matching game with similarities to Simon; the player matches a sequence of shapes which in turn cause the barbershop septet to sound off a short tune  Clothing Store - the player must put together a letter jigsaw to be ''ironed'' onto a t-shirt; the T-shirts can then be printed as coloring pages  Toy Shop - the player builds the toy shown on the right by choosing parts from the shelves; one click attaches the part, and wrong parts must be clicked again to remove before the toy reaches the end of the conveyor belt  Construction Site - the player loads up a truck before it enters a tunnel by clicking on objects that match a given one  Park - As the player wins stars for correct answers in the activities, four stars will allow him to choose objects to arrange in the park  On the bottom left of the screen is a blue notebook icon where parents can access a progress report showing the percentages of correct and attempted answers for each skill covered. The focus of this game is on decision-making and problem-solving as well as beginning to learn letters, shapes, colors and numbers. In addition to the game content, the songs on the disc can be played in any audio CD player, beginning from track 2.</desc>

Kingsley, in the role of the Story Teller, offers a pleasant, pleasurable stroll through an Amazon village and its surroundings. The story follows jungle-boy Kiyeko's effort to retrieve the Night, stolen by a couple of snakes reminiscent of Disney's bad-guy animal characters (the sea witch's twin eels in The Little Mermaid spring immediately to mind), through 11 different animated scenes - from Kiyeko's village in the Amazon jungle, through the forest, to the snakes' lair, and back again. The well-drawn graphics, which integrate 3D backgrounds with 3D animations, and movie-style quality of the title are lovely to look at, regardless of your age.</desc>

		<name>Kyodai Mahjongg</name>
		<desc>A shareware Shanghai-like solitaire game system that uses Mah-Jongg tiles.  Contains a number of unique or non-standard games.  Created and programmed by a fan of Mah-Jongg solitaire.The games are presided over by manga-style girls, who react to the gameplay, let you know you're in the high score board, etc.  High score lists are maintained for all games, all skill levels.  The game is fully customizable- backgrounds, tilesets, and music can be changed (and new selections are available for download through the official site.)  Dragon layout can also be changed, for variety greater than the traditional game provides.Game variations: Solitaire: the standard, famous game, with the standard, famous "dragon" (layout).  Click tile pairs to remove them, if the tiles are free to move to the side.Rivers: same tiles, square layout, new rules; tile pairs must be free to move from side or top, and there can be no more than two 90 degree "turns" to bring the two tiles together.  Players of the old/rare arcade game "Sports Match" will understand the mechanics.Memory: same tiles, square layout; tiles need not be "free", but since they're all turned over, you must remember where partner tiles are located.Clicks: new tiles (color-based rather than MahJongg based).  Based on a freeware game, "Clickomania" (and Sega Swirl is suspiciously similar to it, too.)  Tiles of different colors can be removed if there are more than one of the same color connected.  Gravity affects remaining tiles, which create a dynamic, moving playfield.  Remove as many as possible, and leave as few tiles remaining as possible.Slider: same tiles as Clicks.  Slide tiles around to form 5-tile lines (and remove them).  Each move adds 3 new tiles to the board.Hashira: same tiles as Clicks.  Falling 3-tile sets must be combined to remove combinations of same-colored tiles.  Incredibly similar to Columns.The early versions of Kyodai are suitable for Windows 3.1+.

		<name>Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail!</name>
		<desc>Love for Sail! is the sixth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. Larry unexpectedly receives a ticket to a cruise ship. Upon the arrival of the passengers, a mega-contest is announced. This contest includes various kinds of sports and activities, from bowling to love-making. The winner will get to ''score'' with the sexy Captain Thigh. Naturally, there is no way Larry can win this contest fairly, so he must use his brains to solve the tricky puzzles of the game, and cheat his way into the Captain's bed.

The game's structure is similar to that of its predecessor: the entire game takes place in a large enclosed area (in this case, the cruise ship), with the gameplay focusing on inventory-based puzzles and conversations. The game features a context-sensitive interface: clicking on an object brings forth a series of verbs which the player can choose in order to interact with the given object. In addition to that, it is possible to try and type any other verb (provided the game understands it), just like in old adventure games with text interface. Sometimes it is necessary to think outside of the box and come up with unusual actions in order to solve a puzzle.

Several new features have been added to the game, attempting to make players into more ''active'' participants of the playing process. Using a microphone, players can add their own voices, while using a scanner lets players insert their own photos into the game. Another feature that grabs attention is the automatic wallpaper. When Larry ''scores'' with a woman, that woman's image can be displayed as wallpaper on the Windows desktop.</desc>

		<desc>Shape Up or Slip Out! is the fifth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. All the events from the previous games are forgotten. Larry is once again single, and again his goal is to capture the interest of various ladies. By sheer coincidence, Larry finds himself on a TV Game Show called ''Stallions''. He wins a weekend at the Spa Resort, La Costa Lotta. Naturally, there are some beautiful women in the spa who are just dreaming about such a wonderful, handsome man as Larry! Uh... or is it really so? It is your goal to find out! Using your wit, you should solve all the puzzles and satisfy the wishes of all the ladies!

This instalment focuses more on conversations with women and on puzzles than on the storyline. The entire game is spent at La Costa Lotta. There are plenty of traditional inventory-based puzzles to solve in the game. You can die, but are allowed to try again every time that happens, without the need to restore. This is also the first Larry with SVGA graphics, and voice-overs in CD version.</desc>

The objective of the game is to turn off all the lit buttons in as few moves as possible. Buttons are changed by clicking on them but all adjacent buttons are then also changed. Making a change creates an effect pattern and the game can be played with two different patterns: cross or diagonal. According to the box cover the game consists of over 24 billion puzzles and these are divided into nine different puzzle types. There are four different grid sizes: 5x5, 6x6, 7x7 and 8x8. It's possible to play with pre-programmed puzzles or randomized ones.</desc>

		<name>Literati</name>
		<desc>Literati is a version of a 1990 DOS shareware game that was converted and upgraded with more features for Windows in 1994 for MVP Software.  In 2000, it became a popular part of the Yahoo Games web portal playable in a JAVA format in a web browser.  Similar to Scrabble, the gameplay involves placing letters from 7 tiles per player on a board and trying to accumulate the highest score possible.  Letters are distributed to players randomly and are worth between 1 and 5 points while blank tiles (one which is always given in first 7 tiles of the game) have no point value but can be made into any letter.  The first word must be placed horizontally or vertically with one tile on the center square.  Subsequent words must use one letter of an existing word or be placed next to one so that any touching letters form valid words also.  Knowing the valid 2-letter words is very helpful in doing this.  Placing tiles on letter and word multiplier squares will increase your score and if you place all 7 tiles on the board at once, a 35-point bonus is given.  A player can also choose to pass and select any of the letters in their pile to trade for new ones but loses their turn.At player first creates a table and can change its options for number of players, put a time limit and whether it is unrated or rated (the outcome will affect a person's overall rating).  A challenge mode can also be set so that any word placed on the board can be challenged as to its validity by an opponent.  If it is invalid the word is removed and the player who put it down loses their turn or else the challenger loses their next turn if the word is indeed valid.  Other players choose to Join a table and press Start to begin a game.When all tiles in the game are distributed and one player places all their remaining ones on the board or no-one can play any more tiles then the game is over.  The sum of the letter values in each player's hand is subtracted from their score. If a player has no letters remaining, the sum of all of the letter values in the other players' hands are added to their score. The person with the highest score wins.</desc>

		<desc>Lunacy for Windows is a single-player, shareware, puzzle game. The game is reminiscent of Pipe Mania! in that the player has to guide a spark along electrical wires from a start point to an end point. However In this game the player does not add new pieces of wiring to the puzzle, instead the wiring is already in place and the player rotates it at the node points to make new connections or to break others.Additionally there are special nodes, some of which speed up the spark, some which cause it to burn the wires it passes through so they cannot be re-used and some fixed nodes that cannot be rotated at all.All puzzles are timed. The game has a high score table which holds the ten best scores. The game is played entirely via the mouse.</desc>

		<path>./eXoWin3xConverted/Macbeth (1995).pc</path>
		<name>Macbeth</name>
		<desc>Voyager's Macbeth is a masterpiece in literary CD-ROM. The CD not only includes the fully indexed and searchable text of Shakespeare's famous tragedy (based on the recently published Cambridge edition, edited by one of the CD-ROM's co-authors, Professor A. R. Braunmuller), but more importantly the *complete audio performance* of the entire play by the Royal Shakespeare Company, directed by Trevor Nunn, which stars Ian McKellan as Macbeth, and Judi Dench as Lady Macbeth. Definitely one of the best renditions of the play ever performed. In terms of user interface, Voyager outdid themselves with Macbeth. Not only can you jump to any page or word, but you can also click on any line of the play to go directly to that place in the RSC's audio performance and hear it read out loud. There are numerous notes, anecdotes, and glossary items (over 1,500 of them), all of which are hyperlinked and indexed, and 25,000-word worth of extensive essays that analyze the play in detail. And if that's not enough, you can view video clips from other performances of key scenes, from Macbeth movies directed by Akira Kurosawa, Orson Welles, and Roman Polanski. To top it all off, there's plenty of maps, charts, and images to make this the definitive CD-ROM about the play. As always, you can copy any text from the CD-ROM to paste it into a word processor of your choice. Macbeth is without a doubt another high quality title from Voyager, one that successfully marries the scholarly expertise of the authors -- in this case Drs. Rodes and Braunmuller, two Shakespearian scholars -- with Voyager's technical and design expertise in creating attractive CD-ROMs. If you have even a slight interest in Shakespeare, this wonderful CD-ROM is a must-have.</desc>

Then, about a week later, a lifeboat with survivors was discovered out near the Pleiades but the captain and a couple of other people were still missing. The search went on but turned up nothing and eventually it was abandoned. Some time later a feint signal was detected. It was thought that this could be the Majestic's beacon but it was so very faint that no-one was sure. So a field archaeologist was dispatched to investigate.Majestic Part 1: Alien Encounter is a science fiction point-and-click adventure game. The player takes on the role of the aforementioned archaeologist who locates the Majestic and explores the ship to discover what happened. Unlike traditional point-and-click adventures, however, the player explores the ship by sending up to four probes into the vessel. Each probe can link to systems, scan, cut holes in things with a torch, and pick up objects for examination. As the game progresses the probes can be upgraded to give them additional capabilities. They are controlled via an interface that displays the probe's view in a window the center of the screen. The same interface is used to save and restore the game. The game is entirely mouse-controlled and has a point system which measures the player's progress through the game.</desc>

		<desc>Your only way out of this mysterious house is to solve the puzzles contained in each painting and sculpture. To escape, you'll need to detect forgeries, unscramble mixed-up images, play musical chairs with paintings by arranging them in chronological order, hunt for the works of a particular artist or period, and play many more fun and challenging games and puzzles. Ultimately, you'll leave the house, but you'll take with you a greater appreciation for the world of art. More than 40 unique puzzles and games create a fresh approach to art. It has over 150 famous works of art by 46 artists such as Botticelli, Michaelangelo, Degas, Kahlo, Rembrandt, VanGogh and Calder. Lavish 3-D rendered rooms are covered in artwork from five major periods: Ancient Greek/Roman, Renaissance, Dutch Realism, Impressionism and 20th Century. There's a rich Musical score which showcases music from each period, and the content is researched and developed by art educators.</desc>

		<desc>Blasternaut, Galactic Commander, and Spot, are out searching space for The Lost City in their violet magenta cruiser. Galactic Commander feels this mission so important that she has left her normal duties at the base and joined the crew. Blasternaut and spot, however, are less than thrilled with the seemingly fruitless search.
Suddenly, Doctor Minus, a deep voiced robot with an obsession for subtraction, is behind them and shoots their ship down onto a barren planet where to their, if not the player's, surprise they find The Lost City. Despite this happy coincidence Doctor Minus is preparing an bombardment force and sending his "negatron" minions to the planet to make sure the Blaster crew doesn't get away. Galactic Commander knows more than she is letting on and is convinced that if they can restore power to buildings of the city they'll have an edge...</desc>

		<desc>This game, like its companion Strategy Heads, uses the colorful, fast-paced, irony-laden look and sound of MTV to teach math problem-solving strategies. You can design a surrogate character for yourself from a menu of heads, bodies and accessories. To play the game, choose from a menu of seven TV stations using a remote control icon. Three of the stations feature math games. Go Mental is a math quiz show in which the player must evaluate the reasoning and accuracy of solutions given by other characters in response to word problems. Dance 'Til You Drop asks you to estimate the answer to a series of number problems by sliding a platform (on which you are standing) along a number line so that its width spans a number range which includes the correct answer. The platform shrinks with time requiring greater precision in estimation. The game ends when the platform vanishes and you fall. In Face the Music you try to beat the clock, matching percentages to equivalent fractions and pictures. As a reward you get to design a music video. Other stations feature infomercials, demonstrations of shortcut solutions to multiplication and division problems, and a shopping channel where players can purchase math games, among other items, with their accrued score credit.</desc>

Within each game, there are four math difficulty levels for the user (or parent or teacher) to choose from. If the user correctly answers all of the problems in a game set, he gets a ticket that he can apply toward the purchase of a toy at the prize center. ?The set up of this title is excellent. The prize tickets are great incentive for kids to finish a game,? commented a parent reviewer.The games are fun for young children, and exercise a variety of beginning math skills. In the Calliope Counting Game, the user makes music on a pipe organ by counting out notes, either an original tune or a tune that the Rabbit leads. The Tightrope Show involves matching a number or equation that the rabbit holds up to a given number. In the Sea Lion Show, the user must uncover a number pattern by solving addition and subtraction problems. The Balloon Matching Game is a variation of the classic ''concentration'' game. Behind each balloon is a number, an equation, or a certain number of objects. The user must match the numbers with the correct number of objects or with the equation solutions.</desc>

		<desc>Disney's Donald Duck takes the starring role in this sidescrolling platform game.  As the detective Maui Mallard, he's on the trail of a long lost Idol, which has recently vanished.  Early on, Maui can also switch between his normal self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy voodoo enemies he'll encounter throughout his adventure, he's going to need all the help he can get.As previously mentioned, there are two personalities to Maui, and as a result, two different sets of controls.  Normal Maui carries a bug gun, which can fire a variety of different insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful lightning and fire bugs.  It's also possible for Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast at his enemies.Once Maui starts to find Yin-Yang coins, he'll be able to transform into Ninja Maui.  Ninja Maui has lightning-quick reflexes, and wields a bo staff.  In addition to being handy for whacking enemies, Ninja Maui can also climb between walls by jumping and propping the staff between the walls at the height of his jump.  He can also hook onto duck heads and swing from them to reach areas he normally couldn't.  You'll need to constantly find Yin-Yang coins to fuel your Ninja persona, otherwise you'll run out and transform back to Maui Mallard.The level layout in the Game Boy version is slightly different with less secrets to be found.</desc>

		<name>Metal Marines</name>
		<desc>The Antimatter Cold War has left Earth ruined as the stockpiled AM weapons of various nations were triggered in a chain effect, vaporizing large portions of the Earth. The once great continents have been drastically changed into thousands of tiny islands and various cities have washed into the oceans.  During this turmoil,  Zorgeuf the Great rushes to conquer the bewildered world along with a troop of commanders and declares the Earth Empire. The only hope to defeat him lies from without Earth, as the Colonial Forces send a command carrier from the major orbital base. With so many armies gone, the ground infantry unit has been replaced by the Metal Marine, a fifty foot armored robot that can be sent into battle for attack or defense. From their respective Command Center, each side in the conflict will need to direct the placement of facilities on the ground to defend against enemy attack, manage resources and successfully strike the enemy.Metal Marines is an isometric strategy game. Controlling one side of a conflict, the player must wage a campaign across several islands to defeat Zorgeuf and his lieutenants. The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost.  The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal marine hangers and even ICBMs.  At any time, the player may order an attack and choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to a minor degree (directional) by the player.</desc>

		<name>Midnight Stranger</name>
		<desc>This is the first of two published interactive multimedia CD-ROM based collaborations between writer and director Jeff Green and the Animatics Multimedia Corporation. Noted for its cin?ma v?rit? style, it is a Point Of View (POV) video-based experiment in simulated socializing that takes place in an anonymous city late one night. Players navigate between several locations, and can interact with one or more people in each location to varying effects based on the player's ?reactions? to that person. The main technical innovation of Midnight Stranger is its use of an emotional continuum Mood Bar for interaction with the in-story characters rather than a text interface or an itemized set of options for each interaction. The Mood Bar simulates some of the frustration and uncertainty when dealing with other people in social situations, and provides a more realistic role playing experience.</desc>

		<desc>On a world far away, many millennia ago, a race of advanced beings discovered the 'keys to the universe'. This enabled them to transcend space and time, and so they embarked on a journey to the far ends of the Cosmos. Before leaving their home world, they created the most advanced artificial intelligence ever devised to act as guardian and caretaker. This artificial intelligence was named MILO. But MILO was not a perfect creation, his systems required constant intellectual stimulation in order to maintain their incredible abilities. Without his creators nearby MILO became tired and depleted. As the millennia passed Milo's systems began to fail. Milo desperately needed stimulation in order to reverse his decline ? he needs an encounter with YOU. MILO already knew about your arrival, long before you did, so he didn't waste any time and made preparations. A series of challenges and puzzles for you, which will recharge his intelligence circuits and reverse his decline. The challenges are spread around the home world of the creators and special transport has been provided. If you prove worthy of the challenge you will gain access to the library where you will come face to face with MILO, and if you finally succeed you will be presented with the treasured keys to the universe. But if you fail - you will be trapped forever.You are free to travel to every part of the planet and all you need is to do is solve the puzzles, which are very similar to the ones from  The 7th Guest.</desc>

		<desc>Mines lets you explore a mine. The object of the game is to visit all of the rooms and return all the treasures to the entrance without making too many moves. Specifying a different mine number at the beginning of a game gives you a different mine to explore.

Commands in the game are ?N?, ?E?, ?S?, ?W?, ?U?, and ?D? to move North, East, South, West, Up, or Down, respectively. Other commands are ?C? to carry things, ?I? to inventory what you are carrying, ?L? to leave treasures, ?P? to get the points you?ve scored, ?O? for help getting out of the mine, ?H? for help, and ?Q? to quit.

In a mine, the passages are straight. So, for example, if you go North to leave a room, you can go South to reenter it. The rooms are not evenly spaced. However, the distance between adjacent rooms is always a multiple of the minimum distance between adjacent rooms.</desc>

		<desc>This is an obscure 3D FMV Game. The gimmick of the game is that you're a guy in a special suit that can turn into any object, given it is sampled with this laser attached to his wrist. You take samples of animals to turn into to help you progress and pass various obstacles. The game is like many old-school FMV games in that it's ''do the right action within X seconds to not die''. While the premise would lead you to thinking of endless possibilities, it's entirely linear. And yes, the caption in the screen shot is what he really says....</desc>

Your sword is controlled using directional keys, and swinging your sword at an enemy will damage it more than stabbing it. Each level is completed when you cast a gate spell and go through the gate, but if you spend too much time in a level, the Angels of Mortuum will come after you.</desc>

		<desc>Mosaic is a game where you have a puzzle on a board and you're missing one piece. You have to slide the pieces so that they fit in the right order. You can play with numbers so that you have to organize them in numerical order, or you can use a picture. If you try to solve a picture puzzle, you have to organize the pieces in the right order so you can see the picture. For example, a building could be mixed up and you have to rearrange the pieces so that they look like a building again. For numbers, on the first row, you would have 1, 2, and 3. On the second row, you would have 4, 5, and 6. on the 3rd row, you would have 7, 8, 9. You can also change the grid size to use more numbers or make the picture pieces smaller.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Potato Head Saves Veggie Valley</name>
		<desc>Mr. Potato Head Saves Veggie Valley is a short educational adventure game with point-and-click controls. Veggie Valley has been beset by a terrible drought lately. Even more bad luck arrives as ominous clouds threaten the Country Fair. Mr. Potato Head and his daughter, Sweet Potato, decide to take matters into their own hands, save the fair and bring the clouds to Veggie Valley instead. The player controls both of them as they make their way across the valley, solve puzzles and visit the fair's many attractions.The game is intended for pre-school kids (less than 7 years) and has relatively simple puzzles. They consist mostly of gathering items in the inventory and using them on other objects from the world. Disguising the two potatoes represents an important element as well. Using the in-game editor, you can replace the eyes, nose, ears, shoes, mouth, add a clown wig, and so on. There are several mini games at the local fair, three of which (called Midway Games) can be accessed directly from the main menu: Funny Photo Booth, Counting Pinball and Match &amp; Catch Fishing. The first is another disguise editor, Counting Pinball is a pinball game that teaches the player to count, while Match &amp; Catch Fishing's main goal is to place pairs of identical fishes in the top jars. Both the mini games and the full adventure have two levels of difficulty.Similarly to other educational games of the era, the player can interact with many things from the world, not necessarily pertaining to puzzles or story advancement. This can trigger animations or speeches, giving a better idea on what the object actually is. The protagonists' and other characters' lines are fully-voiced.</desc>

Ms. Chomp races around a maze eating dots for points and dodging ghosts. In the corners of the maze are power pills that turn the tables. After eating one of these Ms. Chomp becomes the hunter and, for a short while, is able to eat the ghosts. Points are scored when Ms. Chomp eats a dot, a ghost, or one of the items of fruit that appear in the maze. The player starts with three lives and additional lives are awarded for every 10000 points scored.The game has a few sound effects, music - but only at the start, and a high score table. It plays in a window and there are game configuration options in the menu bar at the top. Game speed is adjustable by means of an ''animation delay'' number between 0 and 10000, where zero gives the fastest game</desc>

The contestants, real-life girls filmed and digitized, introduce themselves in full motion video clips; you pick five from the pool and go on judging them in the categories looks, brains and talent. While moving between the judging pavilions in colorful rendered video sequences, you earn money by shooting the contestants ? ?their artificial stupidity programs could do irreparable damage to Virtual Vegas if allowed to wander around unchecked?, explains the manual. Understood.While the Looks contest seems to be a sorry excuse to stare at pics of scantily clad women (there?s no nudity in Ms. Metaverse), it also serves to identify males and / or cyborgs which might have slipped into the contest. The Brains and Talent contests display coarse videos of the contestants dancing or performing awkward sketches with Ms. Metaverse host Monty Megabyte (Chris Bonno). Watching these performances costs money, which you earn by shooting girls (see above) or playing a simple slot machine. After you?ve reviewed all the ladies, you may crown one Ms. Metaverse.Ms. Metaverse offers content downloads via the included Mosaic Direct Browser ? see trivia section for a detailed description.</desc>

		<name>Multimedia Celebrity Poker</name>
		<desc>Heartfelt, but rather unrealistic wishes like ruling the world, unlimited processing power or an evening playing poker with three celebrities usually fall into the sphere of competence of a fairy. In case one happens to show up in your home: don?t ask for that poker game. That?s already been taken care of, thanks to New World Computing. NWC-mastermind Jon Van Caneghem invited three class B TV celebrities of the mid-90s for a day of green-screen filming. The result is called Multimedia Celebrity Poker.If you?re into TV series, then you?ll probably have no trouble recognizing the faces of your opponents. Sitting at the poker table are Jonathan ?Riker? Frakes (Star Trek: Next Generation), appearing somewhat tight-lipped; talkative comedian Joe Piscopo (Saturday Night Live), showing off his array of impersonations; and aging starlet Morgan Fairchild (Hotel, Falcon Crest), sitting stiff and generally trying not to look too lost. Digitized video clips, seamlessly integrated into the main frame, depict all actions and movements of the stars -- dealing, calling, playing cards. Separate clips for the three actors are played simultaneously to avoid ?freezing? of single persons; all are continuously in motion. The celebrities comment on the their cards and your success to create a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. The number of different statements is quite limited though; prepare to learn those one-liners by heart.Multimedia Celebrity Poker knows eight different variants of poker. You may play combinations of five cards or seven, stud or draw, lo-ball or high, deuces wild or normal. In any case, it?s always you against the computer; a multiplayer option is not included. In addition to a relaxed round among friends, you can choose to advance levels in a tournament. You win if all opponents are broke, although nobody will undress at that point. Luckily. The program?s poker skill is mediocre; it?s playing fairly straight, rarely risking a bluff. The playing style of the three celebrities does not differ.Ready to join the game? On second thought, maybe you should wait for the fairy.</desc>

		<desc>One of the myriad of indirect Myst descendants and sequel of sorts to Frankenstein: Through the Eyes of the Monster, Mummy is your standard first person adventure game from the mid-to-late nineties. You play the role of Michael Cameron, an investigator for the National Mining Company. One of your company's sites in Egypt has reached a bit of an impasse. It appears the workers there fear that they have come across sacred burial grounds and believe they have awakened a mummy. Your job is to investigate these claims (with the hope of proving them unsubstantiated so work can continue), all the while dealing with the Machiavellian-like site manager and the resident Egyptologist, who happens to be an old flame. Game play involves navigating static, rendered scenes, picking up and manipulating items and occasionally coming across someone, which leads to a short video conversation with them. You never get a choice in such conversations outside of potentially offering the other person an item to have or examine.</desc>

		<name>Music Chase 1: The Music In Me</name>
		<desc>Shaken by the loss of Octave Fingertips, her musical director, the very talented Julia decides to have her body frozen at the height of her career so she can stay there until the ideal director can be found. But, he must have the music in him! To save Julia you must demonstrate how talented you are with 41 musical tests, each containing 5 levels. See your computer turn into a piano, a saxophone, a guitar or even a harp. The main quest, de-popsicle-izing Julia, begins with her father Land O'ner, who starts you on a musical journey though her past. Travel through time to discover the great moments of Julia's life from birth to ice cube, as you solve puzzles which will reveal the musical instruments. Find all of them and you will have proved that music flows through your veins and, of course, Julia will melt and the world will regain its beloved pop star. The Music in Me was to be the cornerstone of a Music Chase series, but no more materialized. It's a totally niche product, which players will either love or hate.</desc>

		<name>Myst</name>
		<desc>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books. The game's interface is reduced to a single cursor for navigation and interaction. Rather than collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, the player must gather subtly placed clues and manipulate complex mechanical devices in order to advance in the game. The world of Myst is mostly uninhabited, and the game has very few live-action scenes with characters and dialogue.</desc>

Also included is an exploration mode and a two-player mode (the two players compete to bring back the most expensive treasures).</desc>

		<desc>Nitemare-3D is a horror-themed first-person shooter and a sequel to the adventure game Hugo III: Jungle of Doom. Hugo's girlfriend Penelope is kidnapped by the nefarious Dr. Hamerstein, who intends to conduct terrifying experiments on her. Hugo has to explore the Doctor's twisted mansion, travel through underground caverns, and eventually face the villain himself and rescue his sweetheart.

The gameplay mostly follows the conventions of Wolfenstein 3D, which the game also resembles visually. However, its gameplay is somewhat more slow-paced and includes heavier doses of puzzle-solving. There are four weapons in the game - plasma gun, magic wand, pistol and auto-repeat plasma gun; enemies may be vulnerable to a certain weapon and resistant against others. The levels are maze-like and contain secret areas. The first episode was released as shareware; two commercial episodes followed, for a total of thirty levels.</desc>

		<name>Noisy Video Poker and Blackjack</name>
		<desc>Noisy Video Poker and Blackjack for Windows is similar to the video machines found in casinos. Originally, Noisy Video Poker and Noisy Video Blackjack could be purchased separately or together. If bought together (on one disk), both games are accessible within all of the games by clicking your mouse on a bottom icon.It is called ?Noisy? for a reason. If you have a sound card, you will be treated to a variety of sounds during the game which will bring a smile to your face even when you lose.  When you win, you will hear coins dropping a metal coin tray.  When you lose, other sounds are played randomly.  There are explosion sounds, a car crash, a donkey, and other sounds, which can be turned off if you prefer.Betting is done with virtual imaginary coins, and the best pay-off (when you win, of course) can be had by betting the maximum of 5 coins. The game keeps track of your statistics and a complete manual can be accessed from the game menu.In Noisy Video Poker, choose from Jacks or Better, Joker Wild and Deuces Wild. The objective is to hold the best five card hand possible. A pair of jacks or better will return the amount of your bet.  Two pair, three of a kind, a straight, a flush, a full house, four of a kind, a straight flush, and a royal flush return increasingly greater pay-offs.  If you have no pairs or a pair of cards of lower value than jacks, you lose your bet.</desc>

		<desc>Oddballz is a spin-off from the Catz and Dogz series, from P.F. Magic.
This time, as the title states, the pets are wacky creatures, more alien-like than animal. Now they can make their eyes come out of their sockets and literally scare them to pieces, while retaining a comic look and feel (something impossible while dealing with Dogz or Catz).
The mechanics are pretty much the same in every game of the series, and here the player also gets to pet them, teach them tricks, punish them or just play around. The Oddballz will respond to each and every move and they can even morph into to something else, depending on what the player does.
The tools the player can use are also very different from the ones in Dogz and Catz, and also have a wacky feel to them. There are tools like the Robo Pogo, the Gravitron, Seismo Ball, Transformer, Atomic Ball, and the delicious Liqui-Food, for feeding the pets.
The company also made additional Oddballz available for download from their site, to add to the starting lot of seven.</desc>

Move and rotate these pieces to build a goal shape (squares, polygons, profiles,...). The program has dozens of pre-made goals, but you can create and save your own. If you are stuck, the program can help you by placing a piece of your choice in the correct position.The program also includes other shapes for the pieces (pentominoes, polyominoes and hexagons), and separated statistics for different players.</desc>

Evil forces have invaded, seizing control of the player's system, and setting loose program icons to cause mayhem. It's up to the player to round up the renegade icons, all the while battling other hazards inside the inner space of the player's computer, and working with--or fighting--the other AI-controlled pilots that populate the system.The game builds its gameworld dynamically from the contents of the player's hard drive, so the game never plays exactly the same way twice. There are racetracks, a dueling arena where the player can settle scores with rivals without interference from the IS Enforcers, and a strange Inner Demon whom the player must ultimately learn to defeat in order to win the game. The player can select from dozens of ships and their variations to play, or create them using the Ship Factory, and upgrade the player's ship capabilities with weapons and equipment bought from the ambulance or salvaged from destroyed ships. The game also includes a screen saver.</desc>

		<desc>Oregon Trail II is a sequel to Oregon Trail. The game follows the basic structure of the predecessor, which is a simulation of traveling through towns and wilderness in the state of Oregon, with adventure-like gameplay elements and educational material. The sequel changes, enhances, and adds many gameplay features.In the beginning of the game players choose their name, occupation, level, date of travel, starting point and destination, as well as the type of wagon. The game also allows the player to create virtual companions for the journey, designating their number, names, and ages. As opposed to one year in the first game, the sequel allows the player to choose between twenty years of travel, from 1840 to 1860.The player is able to choose an occupation for the protagonist, such as banker, doctor, gunsmith, carpenter, journalist, butcher, pastor, artist, and many others. Different occupations bestow various bonuses to the protagonist, and are equipped with passive skills, which will influence the rate of success during certain random events and activities. For example, a high medical skill will make it more likely that the protagonist recovers from a disease; sharpshooting skill contributes to the instant-kill rate when hunting animals, etc.The game retains the supply-managing, trading, sailing, and most other elements of its predecessor. There are more interactive events in the sequel, as the protagonist is able to consult other characters and react differently to some of the events that might occur during the journey.</desc>

The screensaver modules are not as varied in style as LucasArts' underrated Star Wars Screen Entertainment-- they are mostly just slideshows including a lot of random graphical effects. What makes the package stands out, though, is the inclusion of many images and characters from Origin's popular games... you will see and hear Ultima 7's Guardian loom large on screen, booming his famous growls; many images in the package are from unreleased versions of games or posters. As an added bonus, Origin FX includes a module that plays the cinematic sequences when Wing Commander II is installed on your hard drive. Not that this can't be accomplished by using homemade hacks, but it's still quite neat.</desc>

Actions are performed with the mouse, and clicking on items activates animations. There is a row of icons at the bottom of the screen for accessing games, returning to the lake, changing seasons, changing language, and exiting.Oscar's balloon is divided into four quadrants, one for each season - clicking on one of the tree pictures will bring up that season on the lake, and the animals around it will explain how they live at that time of the year. There are 12 mini-games, five of which are available to play from the start - the other seven are hidden in the game and only become accessible as the player uncovers them.</desc>

		<desc>Oscar Flies Into The Mountains is a gentle and accessible introduction to nature. The information on the CD-ROM is provided in a humorous way, and there is a good mix of familiar animals such as bears and cows as well as lesser-known members of the animal kingdom like wood grouse and whistling marmots. Once you've chosen your own rucksack you can join Oscar the balloonist as he flies high through the cold mountains.
Oscar's balloon is decorated with the four seasons of the year. If you click on the winter picture, you are quickly taken to a snowy landscape where the animals introduce themselves. A couple of eagles talk about the joys of flying and show you pictures of their newly hatched children.

The stag, Randolph the Red, talks in an upper-crust accent about his favourite does and admits to having several girlfriends. Unfortunately he knows that one day he will no longer be the leader. Depending where you click, he will talk proudly about his antlers or how his coat keeps him warm when it snows.

Each time you choose an animal, the screen goes dark and you are given a few verbal clues about what they are and where they live before they are revealed. The animals talk in a friendly, good-humoured way and provide a brief insight into their lives--where they live, what they like to eat, who they like and what makes them afraid. (Ages 4 to 8).</desc>

		<name>Out of this World</name>
		<desc>A young physics professor named Lester conducts a particle experiment. Suddenly, something goes wrong, a lightning strikes, and in a moment Lester finds himself in a strange alien world. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens who escapes from the prison together with him helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.

Out of This World combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. The game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.

Typically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. The gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. By pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield which protects Lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. Finally, by holding the fire button even longer the gun creates powerful blasts which can disrupt shields. Most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as Lester. Fighting enemies therefore requires tactical usage of regular attacks, shields, and bombs, as well as learning enemy patterns.

Each level can be accessed by typing a code the player learns after having completed the level. If Lester dies, the level must be restarted. There is no on-screen interface and no in-game dialogue in the game. Vector graphics are used for creating the game's environments and animated cutscenes.</desc>

		<name>Paulie Python</name>
		<desc>Paulie Python is a snake that is hungry for mice. Your task is to guide the green python through various scrolling levels and eat all mice in each of them. However, the mice are often scattered around the level, so you have to search for them first. With each eaten mouse, Paulie grows a bit, making it more difficult to avoid his own tail. You must neither crash into the tail nor the walls, otherwise you will lose a life. Another hazard you might encounter are white balls that bounce around and kill your character when they hit his head. Keep in mind that Paulie's tail stays the same size when you advance to the next level. The same happens when Paulie dies and has to restart a level, while all previously eaten mice reappear. This means that the python grows to an enormous size during the course of the game.You are awarded points for eating mice and bonus points when you beat a level, given that the bonus timer has not run out yet. The faster you clear a level, the more bonus points you earn, which are multiplied by the level number. When Paulie runs out of lives, your game is over. If you got a high score, you can enter your name in the top five.The python can either be controlled by the arrow keys or by the mouse. For clearing a level of all mice, you either go to the next level in the given order or a random level is chosen, depending on the settings. It is also possible to freely choose a level. Furthermore, you can adjust the difficulty by selecting between five different levels of speed. The registered version of this shareware game features the ScreenSculptor, an editor which allows you to build your own levels.</desc>

		<desc>A writer named Adrienne Delaney has just moved into an old mansion with her photographer husband Donald. Shortly after moving in, Adrienne begins to experience horrifying nightmares and have odd encounters inside the creepy old abode. Furthermore, the house is having a severe effect on her husband, changing him for the worse. Adrienne must discover the secret of the house before the unknown force consumes her husband, and unravel the terrible events that have happened in the past.

Phantasmagoria is an adventure game that places heavy emphasis on full motion video for exposition and cutscenes at various junctures to advance the storyline. Adrienne is represented as a digitized character roaming around pre-rendered settings in the house. She inspects various rooms, finds items, adds them to her inventory, finds places to use the items, and triggers advancements in the plot.

Puzzle-solving element is present, though reduced compared to most other adventure games made by Sierra. There are seven chapters in the game, as well as a status screen that tracks the players progress within the chapter. If the player happens to get stuck in the game, a talking skull icon who identifies himself as the hintkeeper can supply the player with hints on request. It is possible to start playing the game from any chapter.</desc>

		<name>Pilgrim: Faith as a Weapon</name>
		<desc>Pilgrim is an adventure game set in the Middle Ages after the Crusades during the 13th century. It is the time of the Knights Templar, the Black Plague and the Inquisition when many were tortured and burned at the stake because of their religious beliefs.Summoned to his father's side, Simon (your character) is told that he must obtain a valuable manuscript in a secret room and deliver it only to Petrus, a friend who lives in Toulouse. His pleading hints that this mission might be dangerous, but Simon agrees even though he doesn't understand. Shortly thereafter, his father dies. The interaction begins in the library as you start Simon's adventure.This is a first person, point and click game with a somewhat unconventional interface. The inventory contains objects which can be used as well as clicked on during conversations. Icons of the people Simon has met or heard about also act as conversation topics when clicked on. The game features an in-game hint system which provides very vague clues to the many puzzles Simon will encounter. A comprehensive encyclopedia is accessible at any time to document and elaborate upon the historical facts of the era and to the game itself. Angels, demons and people from all walks of life will help (or hinder) Simon's progress towards his goals as he travels around France's towns and countryside. Locations are varied with marketplaces, villages, a ruined fortress, gothic churches and, later, fanciful environments. Puzzles include several mechanical problems, helping other characters with objects and information as well as creative environment manipulation.</desc>

She is a little girl that never grows up and lives with no adults in Villa Villekulla, an abandoned house, with a horse (with no name) and a monkey, Mr. Nilsson. She says her mother is in heaven and her father is king of a pacific island. But who really knows ? The original stories, written by Astrid Lindgren since 1945, were adapted into films and television series. Here, is a computerized version where children will discover her little world. First, they'll have to enter Villa Villekulla, by the door, of course.Players will explore the rooms in the Villa (hall, kitchen, bureau, bedroom, and attic) and solve different types of puzzles (i.e. jigsaw, memory). There's also a book activity where children can choose among three books and start these stories with screen texts that can be turned on or off. Texts are available in twelve (say, eleven because of British/American english) different languages.</desc>

		<name>Playskool Puzzles</name>
		<desc>Playskool Puzzles is a set of five educational puzzles intended for kids aged 3 to 6:Explore It! - The player chooses between four pictures (Park, House, Beach and Farm). Each location will have different elements and objects removed and placed randomly at the bottom of the screen. The main objective is to reassemble the picture by sticking the objects in their corresponding areas. Once the image is back to its original form, the player can click on some of its elements to explore them. For example, after completing the park, clicking on the circus within it will trigger a new such puzzle. Clicking on a particular object in the final exploration puzzle will reveal a separate animation featuring it and its name. This way, the kids can learn new words and associate them.Puzzle Maker - A puzzle editor. Using the toolbox and a selection of premade objects, the user can create new puzzles or modify existing ones. Puzzle Maker will automatically import the last picture seen while playing any of the other puzzles. The picture can be cut in three different ways and after that you need to reassemble it as it's normally done in Jigsaw.Connect the Dots - Clicking the numbers or letters in their correct numerical or alphabetical order will trace the margin of an object. After connecting all the dots correctly, the game will show the full object, its name and an animation for it.Mix and Match - It involves combining different body parts to obtain a funny-looking character.Jigsaw - An ordinary jigsaw puzzle.In every puzzle it's possible to modify the original image's colors and draw other stuff on it using the toolbox. The result can usually be saved or printed. There are three difficulty settings: Easy, Medium and Hard.</desc>

Included with each game is a cartoon introducing the characters and situations, in this case, a cartoon called ''Uncle Archibald'', dealing with two young friends who experiment with chemistry to find a secret formula, and end up with more... much more than they'd bargained for. In addition to playing the story straight through, players can jump to any page in the story, though some of the pages lead to others not shown on the list of pages.</desc>

		<desc>Early in the 21st century, the world found itself in a precarious state. A war fought be robots over mineral rights erupted in the Arctic, and mechanized soldiers called Walkers and Killerbots terrorized the planet. Special forces trained in anti-robot techniques tried to respond to the menace.
When the robots invaded El Paso, Texas, the special forces team headed by Sgt. Miller sprang into action.

You'll test your problem-solving powers in your quest to defeat the Cyberheads- travelling through interdimensional tunnels, and avoiding cleverly disguised alien traps.

		<name>Police Quest 4: Open Season</name>
		<desc>Police Quest: Open Season is the fourth installment in the Police Quest series. It abandons the story arc of the previous three games, introducing a new setting and a new protagonist, homicide detective John Carey of the Los Angeles Police Department. Carey finds his best friend and ex-partner, Officer Bob Hickman, murdered in an alley in the Southern part of the city. An eight-year-old boy named Bobby Washington has been murdered as well. Carey begins an investigation that leads him deep into the criminal life of the city and a hunt for a maniacal murderer.The game utilizes Sierra's traditional icon-based interface for interaction with the environment and generally follows an adventure format. However, it focuses on realistic police procedures even more than the previous games in the series. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to examining crime scenes, questioning suspects, and conducting a by-the-book investigation. There is a considerable degree of freedom in the interaction, allowing the player to perform actions not connected to the main story, some of which will, however, lead to the protagonist's death. The game utilizes digitized photorealistic images for its visuals.</desc>

It is the third game in  Diversions Software's Prairie Dog series.Prairie dogs, genus Cynomys, are burrowing rodents native to the grasslands of North America. They are a pest and this game is all about blasting them as they run from burrow to burrow, a bit like a Whac-A-Mole game with guns.There are two kinds of game play, the timed mode and the open season mode. Both are essentially the same but only the timed mode scores are added to the highscore table. The game has sound effects, sniper scope, variable game speed, a high score table and three difficulty  levels. Aiming and shooting is mouse controlled but the keyboard is used to vary the scope's magnification.The open season mode and the ability to change the size of the ammo clip are not available in the shareware version.</desc>

He was an early proponent of computer technology to deliver music whether it be through the internet or in a 3D multimedia experience such as this CD-ROM. At the time, Prince was in a battle with Sony over control of his music and was not using his name but instead used a symbol or glyph which looked like this stood on end...   o(+&gt; The Myst-clone type of experience is a quest to collect the five pieces of Prince?s symbol, as you go through each beautifully rendered ''virtual reality'' world of his Foyer, Studio, Library, Grand Hallway, Dance Club, Boudoir, Virtual Video Room and Candle Room.The structure you journey through is also in the shape of the artist's symbol. There are 11 simple puzzles to solve in order to get clues to play videos and collect the pieces that when all gathered you will see a special final exclusive video.There are hundreds of music samples, video clips, and interactive objects many of which  provide a history of Prince's life, music, albums, posters and friends. There are several mini games such as a working mixing console and DJ deck.There are four full-length music videos, including two new songs: 'Interactive' and 'Endorphin Machine.'  The music studio has a karaoke version of 'Kiss,' and in the private club Eric Clapton, Little Richard, George Clinton, and Miles Davis share their views about him.</desc>

Nuclear weapons, both tactical and strategic, have proliferated throughout the nations of the world, and the five largest nuclear powers, after failed efforts to militarily compel the smaller nuclear-armed nations to disarm, have plunged the world into global war.  You take the role of one of the five major nuclear powers, seeking to extend your sphere of influence and eventually become the dominant power.The game is graphically simple but has a high degree of depth and complexity.  You manage both conventional and nuclear forces, economic factors, and military production.  The main commodities are population, food, and oil, and the latter two must be maintained in sufficient quantity to allow the former to produce.  In addition, all players must worry about increasing global and local radiation levels resulting from the use of nuclear weapons.The author, Dion Kurczek of Silicon Commander Games, has released the game to the public as freeware.</desc>

		<desc>Putt-Putt &amp; Fatty Bear's Activity Pack contains 15 different games and activities for kids 3-8. This is a compilation of Putt-Putt's Fun Pack and Fatty Bear's Fun Pack, along with four new games. Most of the games are played against either Putt-Putt or Fatty Bear.     Some games are traditional, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Reversi, or the card game Go Fish.Others are renamed versions of popular games.
"Remember!" is basically Concentration, a memory game.
"The Cheese King" is Hangman, while the "On-Ramps &amp; Off Ramps" is the board game chutes &amp; ladders. "Word Hunt!" is the device in puzzle books where you find words in letter grids.
In "Guess It!", you use logic to figure out which fruits are used and which locations they've been placed in. "Lines &amp; Boxes"  is another logic game, making boxes by drawing lines between a grid of dots.Finally, Tangrams is a spatial recognition game, fitting pieces into different shapes. Most of these games have multiple difficulty levels. Although designed for children 3-8, many of the games should give even parents the occasional run-for-the-money at the Hardest level.Finally, there are four games just for fun:
In "Circus Stormin'" - a side-scrolling arcade game - you control Putt-Putt up and down, moving him around obstacles and having him pick up balloons. There's also a sliding tiles (logic puzzle) game with slightly varying images, and a Pachinko pinball where you can create your own 'field' of 6x11 bumpers and the balls make amusing sounds when they hit. There's also a 35-page in-game coloring coloring book with 16 mixable palette slots.</desc>

		<path>./eXoWin3xConverted/Quest For Glory IV - Shadows of Darkness (1993).pc</path>
		<name>Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness</name>
		<desc>Shadows of Darkness is the fourth Quest for Glory game. It is a journey into the land of Mordavia - a setting influenced by Eastern Europe, particularly its Slavic areal. The hero had just begun to enjoy his victory in Tarna, when a spell zapped him into parts unknown, without a weapon, items, or even a source of light. Shortly after finding his way out of the dark cave, the hero meets a mysterious woman named Katrina. He traverses the swamps in the dark forest and finally reaches the town. However, the town is also engulfed by a foreboding atmosphere, and the hero cannot allow himself to relax. He must find out what is going on, why the town inhabitants are so hesitant and reluctant to help him, and what horrors are lurking outside of its walls. Life has never been quite so dangerous for our hero. He'll discover his quest soon enough - that is, if he lives.

Like the previous Quest For Glory titles, the game is a combination of puzzle-solving adventure and role-playing. The player character can be a fighter, a thief, a magician, or a paladin. Importing a character from a preceding installment of the series is also possible. Once again the hero improves his skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve the throwing ability, which might be needed to solve a puzzle).

Combat system in this installment has undergone a major change. Battles are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective and are action-oriented. The protagonist is able to move freely, jump, and execute attacks and defensive moves, similarly to fighting games. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to conversations as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.</desc>

		<desc>Radio Active bills itself as The Music Trivia Game Show. Up to four players can compete and each chooses from a set of 16 avatars to represent them. The avatars are all digitized actors and fall into a number of stereotypes such as the fitness instructor, the rebel, the cheerleader, the pirate, the surfer dude, the cover girl, the cowboy, and the nerd. The players take turns answering trivia questions covering music from 1961 to 1985. A player spins the wheel to select a time span of 4-5 years in which the question will fall. The player then chooses either an easy, medium, or hard question, worth 100, 200, or 300 points, respectively. The game asks a question and gives the player a set period of time in which to select from among 16 possible answers. The player has one opportunity to get it wrong. If the player is wrong twice then the next player gets to try the same question. However, if the player gets the question right, then they get the points as well as a point bonus corresponding to the time remaining when the question was correctly answered. After answering a textual question correctly, a player has the opportunity to identify a music melody.Another type of question is the video question. A person will recite clues about a particular musician they once worked with and the player has to choose from among 16 possible answers. Further, the game throws an extended round every 3 rounds. In the extended round, there are actually 3 correct answers among the 16 and each is worth points.</desc>

		<name>Rattler Race</name>
		<desc>Very much a snake game, Rattler Race adds a few twists to the long-held conventions of the genre (those being: you guide a snake from a top-down perspective, always in forward motion; it eats its targets and grows in length, but dies should it collide with any obstacles): in addition to a competing snake foiling your routes, a ball bounces around the play-field, Pong-style, killing your snake should the ball ricochet against its head.The other standout qualities are largely cosmetic: periodically enemy movement ''freezes'', giving the player a period of free motion; the opposing snake will also ''eat'' your targets (here ''apples'' -- occasionally bonus ''golden apples'') and grow longer, though it doesn't seek them out; gameplay can be conducted with as many as three opposing snakes and three bouncing balls complicating the playfield at once; you head for the exit once all apples are eaten, but the enemy snake(s) can exit instead, restarting the level.  Triumph against all these odds and you get 29 more levels of similar gameplay!This unremarkable clone is largely known on account of having been included in the original Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows.</desc>

		<name>Real Video Blackjack</name>
		<desc>Real Video Blackjack is a very realistic simulation of a video blackjack machine like those found in casinos.  The object of the game is to beat the dealer's hand.  You can accomplish this by hitting (taking an additional card) until you have a hand as close as possible to 21 (without going over) or by standing (taking no more cards) in the hope that the dealer will wind up with a lessor hand or bust (go over 21). All actions are mouse controlled and sound effects can be turned on or off.  If playing the game on a Windows 95/98 system, the game loads as a small window on your desktop when started.</desc>

		<name>Schoolyard Slaughter</name>
		<desc>Schoolyard Slaughter is a simple game (albeit an offensive one) wherein players earn points for shooting school children in the head for sport.The gameplay echoes that of the standard point-and-click shooters that were commonly being produced at the time, and features crudely drawn children darting across a fixed backdrop at varying speeds. One hundred points are awarded for each successful headshot, along with a brief animation of the unfortunate victim collapsing in a pool of his or her blood. The player receives extra ammo for every thousand points, and the game ends when the player runs out of bullets. After the game, players can qualify to enter their name into the "Sportsman Journal" (a high score list) if their body count is impressive enough.</desc>

		<desc>Enter a magically interactive dreamscape through which you wander and make astonishing discoveries. Or just relax and savor the paintings, poetry and music that ebb and flow at your command. Navigate through a banquet of interwoven images, metaphoric icons, audible symbols, and words. Most software titles merely allow you to open files and manipulate data. This allows you to open your mind and manipulate your perspective. Immerse yourself in art. Like nothing you have ever seen before - and never on a computer screen. It's art. It's entertainment. It's engaging. It's a window into yourself. Based on a handmade book of collage art by New York artist Tennessee Rice Dixon, images dominate the screen. Traditional imagery is transferred into the electronic age with more than 250 QuickTime sequences seamlessly integrated into the background. The story they tell is the human struggle through stages of life: birth, death, confrontation, reunion, romance and progeny. You explore these stages from a masculine or feminine point of view by clicking on a moon or sun. Once you choose a path, you're captivated with wild scenes such as stallions morphing into seahorses that turn in circles against the night sky. A mixture of poetry and sound complete the experience. text, read by a man and a woman, is taken from sources that include the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the Bible and the Bhagavad Gita. It is the sound, however, that empowers you. As you move across hot spots, one area emits classical music, while another activates birds cooing or the sound of a heartbeat against chirping crickets.</desc>

		<desc>Secrets of the Pyramids is an edutainment title that includes 3 modes: a movie, discovery and game mode. The Movie mode presents a dramatic reconstruction of a series of events that could have taken place in Ancient Egypt. The Discovery mode describes Ancient Egypt culture, religion and history. In the Game mode you will follow Harold Peabody - dreamer, adventurer and optimist - on his quest for the hidden tomb of the mythical Pharaoh Ankh-Re. After finding a way to open the door to the pyramid, the player has to explore the pyramid, find useful items and overcome various obstacles. Stepping on the wrong tile or opening a wrong door may result in the untimely death of the hero. To avoid traps and decipher clues the player has to consult an ''English-Hieroglyphics translator'' found early in the game. Secrets of the Pyramids is a short, inventory-based adventure game with a simple interface (with a ''look'' and ''use'' icon). The player can only save one game at a time (by pressing the S-key). The game comes with a soundtrack and some sound effects; comments are shown in message windows that pop-up (no voices).</desc>

		<path>./eXoWin3xConverted/Sensible Golf (1994).pc</path>
		<name>Sensible Golf</name>
		<desc>Sensible Golf is a 2D golf simulation.

Having been quite successful with their cute action soccer game Sensible Soccer, Sensible Software decided that the concept of ''No fuss, just fun'' could be applied to other sports, too. They chose golf.

Sensible Golf is not an accurate simulation of golf, but an action adaptation of the sport streamlined for quick and easy gameplay. Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes. Apart from that, the player's only concerns are the water and sand hazards, and the distance to the hole. As a result, Sensible Soccer is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game.

Striking involves only two action: Aiming the pointer in the desired direction, and pressing the action button three times. The game uses the well-known three-click-control, with which you set power and swerve of the strike. The computer automatically suggests a proper club, but the player may change it manually. A pop-up map helps one find their bearing.

The courses are fictional, composed from a pool of holes which often appear in multiple courses, sometimes with minor variations. Play modes include single 18-hole rounds, a complete season and a tournament. Up to 72 human players may participate in the latter.</desc>

		<name>Sesame Street: Numbers</name>
		<desc>Numbers is an interactive Sesame Street computer game that was originally developed by the Children's Television Workshop in 1991.

Initially released as one of two CD-I games by Philips Interactive Media, under the label ''A Visit to Sesame Street,'' the game was modified for CD-ROM releases. The first of which was released specifically for the 3DO by Electronic Arts (1994), and subsequently by Creative Wonders (1995-1997), The Learning Company (1998), and Encore Software (2001). The game was also included in the Sesame Street Learning Series: Toddlers Deluxe CD-ROM set.

Elmo guides the user around Sesame Street while number recognition, counting, adding, subtracting, and other math skills are encouraged. Other characters include Ernie, Bert, Big Bird, and the Count.

As with its companion Letters, this game features posthumous voice-over work by Jim Henson as Ernie and Kermit the Frog. A special thanks message to Henson is seen at the end credits.</desc>

Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps.

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at you suddenly, unexpectedly, and most of all OFTEN. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause you to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. It's allso worth mentioning the fact that if your torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and you forget to light a new one, you'll trip in the dark and break your neck.

A Windows 3.x update to this game was created in 1991.</desc>

		<desc>In Shivers, an adventure puzzle game designed by Marcia Bales, the player takes a dare from friends to spend a night in professor Windlenots Museum of the Strange and Unusual. The museum had yet to be opened and has been abandoned and forgotten ever since the professor has mysteriously disappeared 15 years ago, along with 2 students who are suspected to have wandered inside the museum. A collection of ancient South American vessels, believed to contain evil spirits, are removed from their display, opened and scattered all around the museum, with the spirits lurking in every corner. It is your task to find all the matching vessel parts, and capture them again before they can entirely drain your life essence. However, the task becomes harder as the entire museum is covered with puzzles which need to be solved in order to proceed.</desc>

		<name>Sid Meier's Civilization</name>
		<desc>Sid Meier's Civilization is a turn-based single- or multiplayer strategy game. The player takes on the role of the ruler of a civilization, starting with only one settler unit and one warrior, and attempts to build an empire in competition with one to eleven other civilizations. The game requires a fair amount of micromanagement (although less than any of the simulation games). Along with the larger tasks of exploration, warfare and diplomacy, the player has to make decisions about where to build new cities, which improvements or units to build in each city, which advances in knowledge should be sought (and at what rate), and how to transform the land surrounding the cities for maximum benefit. From time to time the player's towns may be harassed by barbarians, units with no specific nationality and no named leader. These threats only come from unclaimed land or sea, so that over time there are fewer and fewer places from which barbarians will emanate.</desc>

from other Old World powers, strange native cultures, the problems of establishing profitable trade programs, and the problems of organizing an army from a rag-tag band of colonists.

As outside forces come into play, the Captain finds himself in the midst of a life-and-death struggle to save not only the ship, but to reveal a sinister plot that could start a devastating global confrontation.The interactivity in the game appears in the form of a Action/Dialog Interface, which is presented every 15 to 30 seconds throughout the adventure. The three choices presented are actually integral parts of the script. The player must select one of the options by clicking on the number (or the line of dialog), or using the numbers on the keyboard. The decisions made by the user determine which direction the story takes, up to the next Action/Dialog Interface box. As the player continues through the game, he'll be presented with a multitude of crises which must be prioritized and dealt with appropriately. Depending on his decisions, he may reach several types of endings, from death to survival, and some humorous ones.</desc>

		<desc>SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new municipality, with the responsibility of building and maintaining a place where citizens can move to and work and be happy. The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.</desc>

The challenge lies in seeing for how long the player can faithfully reproduce the expanding sequences without making a mistake.Unlike the original four-button Simon machine, this game's interface has five buttons.</desc>

Your goal is to build a skyscraper that is both tall, aethestically pleasing, popular, and, most importantly, economically profitable. To be successful, your building cannot just be levels upon levels of officespace, or just an apartment sky-rise, but a multi-functional haven for humanity featuring everything from penthouses to theatres, restaurants to shopping malls. The centerpiece of your tower design is your elevators and proper managment is the key.You can watch your Sims enter and leave your grand tower, getting impatient waiting for elevators, or having a hectic work day at the office. You can even train in on one or two, to server as a metering stick for their compatriots, or just to peek into the average workday of the little people living in your building. Or watch the security and resuce crews race as distasters like bomb threats and fires rampage through your well-crafted skyscraper.</desc>

		<desc>SimTown is one of several entries in the city-building simulation series, SimCity. As in prior installments, players are tasked as the mayor of a newly formed municipality, taking charge of it's expansion and success. Being aimed at a younger audience than that of the other games within the series a greater emphasis is placed on managing a small, socially ideal town than a sprawling metropolis. As such it features a much more stylized, cartoon representation and user interface, a number of added features allowing for greater interactivity with the populace, and a simplified system of resource management.As their first priority as mayor players will simply need to construct a town, supplying not only housing for their residents but employment, schools, and civic buildings as well; Roadways and bike paths being needed to connect them all. While each building has its own associated costs and benefits they're often marginal enough that a player's selection will often be as much an aesthetic consideration as a functional one. In order to finance all of this consideration will also have to be paid to the player's limited resources of water, wood, and crops, which rejuvenate only so quickly.Interacting with the populace will also be crucial to success. Individual citizens will often offer suggestions and make demands of the mayor and so a close eye will have to be kept on their opinions of how the city is being run. Those that favor specific types of restaurants will request them and objections will be made if the city is lacking in their preferred form of recreation. Players can also take a closer look at their residents by 'removing' the tops of buildings and peering inside, watching their life unfold on a more minute scale. Specially constructed designer characters can also be made to populate the town, built to pre-defined specifications such as their preferred clothing and personal preferences.A number of awards can be gained within the game for exemplary achievements resulting from maintaining a balanced town for some period of time. An in-game newspaper will assist in these efforts by helping to keep the player up to date on what might be wrong in their city, or how they might be succeeding.</desc>

SimTunes is an interactive 'painting/music/simulation' game. The user paints colored squares on a virtual grid, where each color maps to a tone in a musical scale. Then the user unleashes four little 'bugz' to roam around on the painted grid. Each bugz has an instrument or vocal style associated with it, and when it walks over one of the squares of light it 'plays' its sound at that tone. The user can control the scale, the instruments, and the speed and direction of the bugz, creating an interactive musical experience.</desc>

		<name>Sinkha: The 3D Multimedia Novel</name>
		<desc>In this 3-D multimedia novel, Hyleyn is a young girl trapped in the slums of Thalissar, an enclosed city on an environmentally inhospitable planet. No one important remains - the rich and powerful leave, and those who cannot are relegated to a seedy, backwater existence amid the incessantly howling, eerie winds of the decaying megalopolis. Outside contact is minimal. From time to time the Corporation sends out a ship to ensure its interests are maintained, and even more rarely Thalissar is visited by the Sinkhas who are immortal beings who maintain benign order in the net of aligned worlds. They travel aboard the living starship Darcon, and each has the guise of one of the races that inhabit the net worlds. Mortals fear to look upon them, but Hyleyn seeks them out, desperate to plead for her escape from Thalissar. She has also fallen in love with a Sinkha, the silver-haired Aker. Her wish is granted and she is shuttled to the Darcon, where she experiences virtual tableaux of beauty and peace, richly colored, clean and soothing. For the first time in her life she also hears quiet, finally away from the mysterious, maddening winds of Thalissar. Her newfound peace is shortlived however, as the Darcon moves to investigate unusual readings on the planet's surface and the incomprehensible crash of a Corporation ship at the source of these signals. Sinkha is a visually stunning work that braids multimedia features tightly with the graphic novel concept. It is baroquely detailed, lavishly textured and generously lathered with realistic animation and 3-D. The score is digital in flavor and the sound effects well chosen - the viscous lap of detritus-laden waters on metal, the drone of high powered winds and dynamos. Although visually complex, the actual story is muddled and hackneyed, degrades quickly and the characters have about as much emotional depth as sock puppets. However, this production is fabulous because the artistic and design elements are so strong (if a bit derivative of H.R. Giger).</desc>

		<name>Skat 2010</name>
		<desc>Skat 2010 is a simulation of the card game skat. There are many variants, but here is the principle: The game is usually played with three persons. Two of the players are playing against a single one but are not allowed to communicate. Each card has a value and one suit is called ''Trumpf''. In every round each player looses one of his card and the one which played the ''Trumpf'' card with the highest value gets all the played cards. If no ''Trumpf'' is played the highest value scores. At the end each player counts the values of his cards. The goal for the single player is to get more points than the other two combined.The main feature of Skat 2010 is the integration of many local skat variants. If your favorite rule set is not included you can create it yourself with the freely adjustable rules. There is also a highscore list and speech.In the shareware version you can't change the rule set and there are several small restrictions while playing.</desc>

		<desc>SkiFree is the standalone version of the game originally included as a part of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack 3 (1991) for Windows 3.x, and later made available separately for Windows 3.x. It was then re-compiled for 32-bit Windows systems when the author found back the source code and released it for free through his website.Players control a skier on a downhill slope on a mountain. From the start, three types of courses can be selected, but these can also be ignored. In Slalom, the skier needs to pass flags on the right side and makes his way down to the finish. Tree Slalom is identical, but has a lot of trees on the course. The final one is Freestyle were points are scored by performing jumps and doing tricks in the air, followed by a safe landing.The skier can be steered using the keyboard or the mouse. It is also possible to jump, but the biggest ones are achieved with the help of rocks, bumps and rainbow-coloured pads. After the finish, the skier can move on until he is caught by the abominable snow monster. There are various obstacles, such as trees, snowboarders, rocks and more.</desc>

		<name>Skull Cracker</name>
		<desc>Skull Cracker can be considered the spiritual successor to the 1991 title Creepy Castle that Bill Appleton wrote for Reactor Inc. The game is set in an alternate world where it is normal to see zombies and monsters roam the streets. They are kept under control by MEI (Mortality Enforcement, Inc.) - an organization that ''helps the dead stay dead''. As the monsters grow in number however, they organize themselves and demand civil rights. Since they are a common sight and fairly harmless, people do not worry about them, but a mysterious substance known as Goop changes the monsters' character drastically.MEI brings in the freelancers Mortis ''The Skullcracker'' Rigor and Penelope ''Bonebreaker'' Jones to bring back order. Players can choose between one of the two characters, each with a distinct fighting style. With side-scrolling brawling gameplay, they need to travel through four main locations of four levels each. Some of the places visited are a shopping mall, an arcade, the graveyard, a playground, the MEI headquarters, and more. Next to moving, jumping, and climbing, they can punch and kick opponents, and use power-ups such as flare guns, flame throwers or supersoakers filled with holy water to take out enemies, while replenishing health with pick-ups.</desc>

		<name>SkyBorg: Into the Vortex</name>
		<desc>This graphics adventure game from Skybox (the well-known trading card company), came with three packs (18 cards total) of Skyborg trading cards. In the game, you are the Skyborg. The objective is to find and rescue Dr. Barton from his kidnapper(s) and escape. Along the way you will visit nine varied worlds, each of which has things needed to complete the game. While wandering around, you will encounter 95 characters in the form of cards, some of which are on walls or posters; many of the character cards are just standing around for you to walk up and acquire tools, knowledge, and weapons from them, a very unrealistic and unbelievable concept. There are several times in the game when you have to battle a ''sentinel'' (robot) in an action sequence (it's easy to die here). Overall, the graphics in Skyborg are not particularly outstanding, although some of the animations are actually quite good (the equipment repair/morphing sequence is pretty cool). Most of the graphics are static pictures with scattered hot-spots. There is quite a bit of text to read, which comes across as notes found or electronic messages received by Skyborg; these latter messages are printed on the screen in tiny letters and are difficult to read without getting close to the monitor. The audio has its moments, although the voice of Skyborg's nemesis, the evil Morb, comes across as very amateurish and grating; the original soundtrack and music is provided by the band Primal Future.</desc>

		<name>Slay</name>
		<desc>Slay is a rather simple turn-based strategy game with a medieval theme. The game takes place on an island, which is a grid of hexagon tiles divided up between the 6 players. You must try to capture your enemies' territory, and the goal of the game is to conquer land and control the largest area. There are four types of troops, each stronger then the lesser ones. The weakest are the peasants (displayed as an unarmed man), spearmen (peasants with spear and shield), knights and the strongest are the barons (knight with spear and shield). The troops are upgraded by combining lesser troops. Some tiles contain resources or assets which the players can use to their advantage, like a castle, a cottage or trees.The game covers many of the basic principles of war, such as the divide and conquer principle, the perils of multi front warfare, knowing when to attack and when to defend, finding the enemies weak spots and protect your own. It is also a game of resource management and risk assessment; for example, barons use up more resources from the territory.</desc>

Puzzles also reset to an unsolved state after you've solved them so you can't go back and appreciate your past brilliance except by looking at the progress bars for each puzzle type.</desc>

Your score is tracked for every indivdual puzzle, so for puzzles with variable scoring, you can go back and try to do better (the game suggests what the maximum possible score is for every puzzle, but sometimes the developers can be beat).

Puzzles range from straightforward word puzzles (''Word Loops'' and ''SyllyBusters'') to musical (''Stepping Tones'') to trivia (''Who What Where When'') to spatial manipulation puzzles (''Tumblin' Dice'' and ''Paradox Puzzle'') to logic puzzles (''Take A Seat'' and ''Gumball'' ) to math puzzles (''Shopping Cart'') to variations on traditional games (''Poker Solitaire'' and ''Solocala,'' based on the traditional African game Mancala). Other puzzles are hybrids or just plain hard to classify: ''Snake Pit,'' ''Balloon Kaboom,'' ''It's A Snap,'' ''Butterflies,'' ''Crossword Slide,'' ''Paper, Scissors, Rock,'' ''Word Flip,'' ''Sheepdog,'' and ''Meteor Mayhem.''</desc>

		<name>Soft Kill</name>
		<desc>Imagine a high-tech attack on the United States... Imagine a unique story told in an unprecedented way. Developed by Xiphias, the company that introduced the first computer graphics system to be used in television news (KNXT in Los Angeles), Soft Kill is a unique techno-thriller based on the latest in hi-tech that explores the possibility of a world power using non-lethal warfare to bring the U.S. to its knees. Two politically opposed characters are thrown together in defense of the United States as a rogue element of the Japanese military attacks the Alaska Pipeline, the Panama Canal and the Malaccan Straits. The action explodes from a secret U.S. Navy base on Kauai to an ancient military shrine in Tokyo, from the North Shore of Alaska to the Palaces of Riayadh and the deep bowels of the United State's computer systems. Founded in a deep understanding of the vulnerability of the American infrastructure to attack and disruption, and the age-old attempts of governments to contest each other's territories of influence, this story combines high drama with photo-realistic imagery and video of secret places. The disk contains more than 70 digitized images and more than an hour of narration, which tell the story of what ''nonlethal warfare'' will be like in the not-so-distant future. Soft Kill owners can have the story told from different perspectives, including those of a narrator and the story's main characters. The innovative gameplay system consists of seven rows of ten cells each (called the Matrix), with four storytelling modes possible: Author (basic storytelling), Point-of-View (first-person views of varying subjects or subplots), Random (play sequences within each cell), and User (create your own path through the cells).</desc>

		<name>Solitaire Twin Pack</name>
		<desc>Solitaire Twin Pack contains two card games, Pyramid Solitaire and Golf Solitaire.Pyramid Solitaire : In this game the cards are arranged in a pyramid and the object is to remove cards totalling 13 until all cards have been removed. In this game each card has a value starting with the Ace which counts as 1 through to the King which counts as 13. The object is to make 13 points i order to remove cards from play so at 13 points Kings can be removed as soon as they become available but Aces must be paired with Queens, 2's with Jacks, e.t.c. Each card removed will make available the card above it in the pyramid. When a player runs out of moves to make they may draw another card from the deck and try to use that card to form a match. The game concludes when all the cards have been removed from the pyramid or when no more moves are possible.Golf Solitaire : This may be played as a single hand or as a series of nine hands or holes in the game terminology.  The player starts each 'hole' with a score of 35 points, that's the number of cards that are on the table. One point is deducted for each card removed from the table. The object in each 'hole' is to clear all the cards from the table. The object of each game, as in a round of golf, is to finish with as low a score as possible. Card suits are irrelevant in this game. The player removes cards from the table by putting together sequences of cards starting with the card turned over. A sequence is made by playing a card from the table that is numerically one different from the card that's in play. Thus if a 5 were turned over the player could play any available 6 or any available 4 because these numbers are next in sequence. Once the 6 or 4 is played the turn continues until there are no more cards to be added to the sequence at which point the next card is turned over.    Both games are played with the mouse and come with in-game help text, and the ability to change the pattern on the back of the cards. Only Pyramid Solitaire has an Undo function and only Golf Solitaire has a Save Game option.</desc>

		<desc>Space Bastards is a Space Invaders clone with raytraced graphics, lots of weapon power-ups and a two player mode. You move your spaceship at the bottom of the screen, firing missiles while dodging shots from the endless waves of aliens.The aliens move in a left to right pattern and speed up as their numbers decrease. Very slowly, the game gets more difficult as the aliens will return fire more and more. Every now and then, a UFO flies across the top of the screen, which drops a weapon power-up when you shoot it. Catch the power-up to temporary increase your fire power. A weapon bar will appear next to your score, and after a short time it will run out. After that you return to your default weapon, the slow firing missile which doesn't do that much damage.There are lots of different power-ups weapons. The green slime blobs do the least damage but are still better than your default gun. The laser beam cuts through columns of aliens like butter. With the 3-way shot and 6-way shot you can spray the aliens like bugs. The grenades explode on impact taking out the surrounding aliens. Laser grenades also explode on impact but they then shoot two laser beams side ways, taking out an entire row of aliens. The flamethrower almost works like an eraser, simply move from left to right to wipe out the enemies. And finally, there's the nuke, a rare power-up that instantly kills all aliens on screen.The longer you play, the more the aliens fire back at you, the more you really need power-ups to survive. If your weapon runs out right at the beginning of a wave of aliens, you're stuck with your standard missile weapon which can only take out one alien at a time. So you will have to find a certain rhythm to defeating the waves of aliens, making sure you always have a power-up when a new wave arrives.You can play solo or with two players, which makes the game even more frantic. If you don't have someone to play with, you can even play co-op with the computer controlling the second spaceship.</desc>

		<name>Space Quest VI: Roger Wilco in the Spinal Frontier</name>
		<desc>Roger Wilco, the brave interstellar janitor who has already saved the universe from many great dangers, is now in a very embarrassing position. His commanders show no respect for his courageous actions in the previous game. Instead, he is being accused of all kinds of violations against the galactic law, is deprived of all the honors he got in the previous game, and as a token of mercy, is allowed to return to his old job - cleaning closets... But those unfortunate events are just the beginning of much bigger troubles Roger will get into. Once again, the future of galaxy depends on him!

Space Quest 6 is the first game in the series to be released exclusively on a CD ROM. The game continues the humorous tradition of the series and is especially inclined towards parody of popular sci-fi movies. It features SVGA graphics and voice-overs for conversations and text descriptions. The interface is slightly different from icon-based system used by Sierra in many other adventure games: the player chooses verbs from a menu that appears at the bottom of the screen, similarly to earlier LucasArts titles. Unlike all previous Space Quest installments, the game allows the player to retry immediately in case Roger dies, without the need to restore a previously saved game.</desc>

Carrying a parting message from Roger's old nemesis, Sludge Vohaul, they plan to get rid of the janitorial hero, execution style. That is, until a man with an over-sized hair dryer helps Roger escape through a time rip into the future. Now Roger Wilco has woken up on his home planet, some time in a meta-fictional Space Quest XII. It is a grim, dystopian future: the series has gone to ruin without its hero, and Vohaul rules supreme. Roger must find a way to avoid Vohaul's henchmen, fulfill his destiny, and learn about a few surprises that await him in his own future.Space Quest IV is the first in the Space Quest series to feature Sierra's icon-based SCI interface and 256-color graphics. The command set includes icons for walking, looking, using or taking, talking, smelling, tasting, as well as inventory access. Roger Wilco is shown on the screen from the exterior in multiple viewpoints. Like in the previous games, inventory-based puzzle-solving co-exists with timed tasks and various hazards that will kill Roger if the player is not careful.</desc>

Your faithful ship has seen better days but it gets the job done. You're contemplating some hot downtime at the red light spaceport when suddenly you realize you are not alone. You're a space privateer at the helm of your solo craft in search of rare alien artifacts. Responding to a distress signal, you are lured by the irresistible song of the sensuous Space Sirens emanating from a mysterious space station. You enter their domain only to realize that you've been entrapped in a VR chamber. Fulfill their every desire or remain a sex slave on the station forever. Your prime objective - search and fulfill. With advanced technology called Touch &amp; Feel User Interface (TFUI for short, pronounced tuh-foo-eee), users can interact with the Space Sirens by selecting an icon to represent an-ahem-''appendage,'' whether it be a hand or ''other special interface tools.'' Each Siren is more difficult to please, so work hard and fast to peak their O-Meter without losing control of yourself, or it's end for you.</desc>

		<desc>Space Sirens 2: Megababes from Ajia is an interactive adult title completely told from a first-person perspective. The many adult situations in this game feature nudity and graphic sex.  Set in a futuristic sci-fi world, the beginning of the game has the titular space sirens capturing the player's space craft.  After an arcade segment where the player fights off a wave of aliens, the space sirens appear and incapacitate the protagonist.  However, as he is a person of great respect and renowned, the space sirens are willing to spare his life if he is able to pleasure them sexually. Failure to do so means death.The game play consists of interactive movies where the player must make the correct choices in order for his particular space siren to achieve orgasm. Using what Pixis describes as a TFUI (Touch Feel User Interface) players can manipulate the NPC in various different ways.  Icons can be used in two different ways:  the hand can stroke and massage or be used to remove clothing;  the penis can be used in a standing position or a lying position.  Furthermore, the NPC can be turned around 180 degrees for complete visibility.  Touching a body part with the respective icon at the right time will play a movie that will raise the siren's pleasure meter;  when doing so at the wrong time the player will receive an admonition from the siren to slow down.  If at any time the player reaches climax before the siren the player will lose one of his three turns.</desc>

		<name>Spelling Jungle: Yobi's Basic Spelling Tricks</name>
		<desc>Spelling Jungle (also known as Yobi's Basic Spelling Tricks) is an educational game with puzzle elements. The general objective of the game is to paddle a raft up a river, preventing it from flooding. The game consists of two main gameplay modes: solving a word-spelling puzzle on the ''puzzle map'', and participating in a simple spelling test. The objective of the puzzle map is to collect letter tiles by walking over them in the correct order, spelling a suggested word. The game consists of 101 such maps, gradually increasing in difficulty: the player will eventually have to avoid enemies (such as rhinoceroses and tigers), try not to fall into bottomless pits, and use various tools and vehicles to get to the desired letter.

		<name>Spider-Man Cartoon Maker</name>
		<desc>This is a recreational software package that allows the user to create animations with a minimal level of sophistication by utilising a library of backdrops, animations and sound effects from the 1990s Marvel Comics television series, Spider-Man: The Animated Series. The game features narration by Christopher Daniel Barnes, who plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the animated series. The game includes all the major characters from the animated series, and for each cast member, typically includes three animations. The game includes original music and some characters not found in the animated series who were dropped half way through production such as the Beetle. A sequel was released, X-Men Cartoon Maker which could be installed over the top of this package and includes the animation from both. Choose from backgrounds such as the Kingpin's Headquarters or the Underground Subway Tunnel, then stamp in props to set the stage. Just click to hear Spider-Man himself to explain all the options. Pick a character to animate. Make Spider-Man leap from roof to roof. Should you pit Spidey against Venom? the Green Goblin? Kraven the Hunter? Spider-Man's trickiest villains are lying in wait. Who will win? You decide. Cool sounds explode from your speakers as the action unfolds. You can even use a microphone to narrate the story, and give the villains exciting dialogue. Build suspense with tunes from the Music Library and thrill your friends.</desc>

If you kill the beginning or the end of the Squirmer, you will shorten him. But if you kill a part from the mid, you will divide him into two Squirmers, and so on.The Squirmer moves from top left to top right, then moving a row down, then moving back to left. If a mushroom is in the way, he will change the row until he can move normally. You, however, can move your ship to any place inside the bottom halve of the playfield.The foes in the game (flea, spider, and scorpion) will hunt you, if they catch you, you have lost a life. This is also the case when the Squirmer got you.But the game also offers two friends. A butterfly, which will leave a cocoon some times. If you fire at this cocoon, it it explode and kill anything in range. The other friend is the snail, which sometimes is above a mushroom, shoot at this mushroom and he will give you some of his powers (Spread Gun, Laser, or Invincibility).</desc>

		<desc>Star Merc is a single-player, first-person, space shooter from Diversions Software. The object of the game is to achieve a  score high enough to be recorded on the high score table.The player takes the role of a mercenary hired to keep the space lanes clear. This means dropping into sector after sector of space and destroying any ship that is present. The limitations are that the canon will overheat if overused and that each sector jump uses fuel which must be replenished by visiting a star base.In combat there is the tactical scanner which looks like a red radar screen. This gives an indication of the position and number of enemy ships and, when combined with target direction indicators in the targeting window, help the player blast the bad guys.The game is played out in the cockpit of the ship and is entirely mouse controlled. The mouse functions in two ways. In 'ship' mode moving the mouse steers the ship while the left mouse button fires the canon. The left mouse button toggles between this mode and 'cockpit' mode in which the player can select either the 'Eject' button to end the game or the 'NavTrack' screen in which the player selects the next sector to jump to.</desc>

Be ready to participate in this interactive adventure, so you can truly experience what it feels to be a Klingon. Klingon is basically a full-motion video click-your-own-adventure. At certain points in the game, you will be given a few seconds to make a decision on what to do. You perform action by clicking on the object onscreen, or do nothing (which is sometimes appropriate). Make the right choice, and the game continues. Make the wrong choice, and Gowron scolds you for not learning, and gives you another chance as the program was ''rewound'' back to that decision point. The game also comes packaged with a Klingon Language Lab, which helps to teach you about the Klingon language, complete with speech recognition to correct your Klingon pronunciation.</desc>

		<desc>The Star Trek Omnipedia is an interactive CD-ROM that contains content from the Star Trek Encyclopedia and Star Trek Chronology. It was succeeded by later versions that were simply called the Star Trek Encyclopedia. The software allows the user to call up commands to the computer with the use of a microphone. An extensive training program is required before use, so that the computer will recognize the user's voice. For added authenticity, the user can address the ''Computer'' and it will reply with a beep before proceeding with the request. Majel Barrett provides the voice of the computer and Mark Lenard narrates several featured topics illustrated with diagrams and imagery. These include biographies of James T. Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard, Star Trek production history, The history of the Enterprise and the history of the future. The initial release of Omnipedia covered all 3 seasons of TOS, all 7 seasons of TNG, DS9 up to Season 2 and the first six Star Trek films. Users who had registered the software received a free update CD-ROM in December 1995 that added information on DS9 Season 3, VOY Season 1 and the seventh feature film, Star Trek Generations.</desc>

Some of the mini-games themselves parody other Star Wars games: ''Dork Forces'' is a spoof of Dark Forces, ''X-Schwing'' is, of course, the counterpart of X-Wing, and ''Wrecked All Assault'' is a purported 'secret area' of Rebel Assault in which you fly through the intestines of Jabba the Hut. The game also includes references to popular culture, such as the selection of ''Scrapped Scripts'' which show what Star Wars would have been like if it had been written by Woody Allen, Jerry Seinfeld, Spike Jonze, or Quentin Tarantino.</desc>

		<name>Stardate 2140.2: Crusade in Space</name>
		<desc>Crusade in Space is a single player, mouse controlled game of space exploration and conquest.
The game starts by displaying a series of short sentences, one at a time, on the screen. "Finally. The people of your world are under one ruler. YOU The Emperor! Now your scientists have given you spaceflight. Your armies are training for planetary invasions! An entire galaxy awaits your rule! As you begin your CRUSADE IN SPACE". All of which neatly sets the tone for this strategy / resource management game.
The player takes control of a small fleet around a single star in a big galaxy. The object of the game is to build more and bigger fleets, strategize, and conquer it all. Planets can be tasked to produce ships, troops and planetary defences. Fleets can be ordered to attack nearby systems and once the opposition is defeated in space transports can be sent to conquer the planets.
In game time is based on a stardate system which can be frozen or sped up as required. This enables the player to send fleets across large distances, or construct capital ships quickly in real time.</desc>

When you first log in you will be asked to chose a category of words (Holiday, homophones, etc.).You are then brought to a screen with three options, Crisscross, Flash Cards, Word Search. Crisscross is a sort of crossword puzzle, but instead of clues you just need to figure out where the words go. Flash cards are flash cards? You hear or see a word then spell it out. Word finder is a grid filled with letters wherein several words are hidden.

Once you finish the above you can enter a spelling bee where you face the Master of Mischief and/or his robots. Winning opens up new levels of competition such as Regional or international.</desc>

For example, Joe blows his Boss? head off with a cannon; his superior takes his revenge in working Joe?s head with a lawnmower. You may choose the type of assault. Additional material on the CD includes a couple of uninspired ?flying heads? screensavers, nice desktop wallpapers and a collection of icons and sound samples.All of the animation in Take Your Best Shot is taken from the animated short film Push Comes To Shove (1991).

However, things start to fall apart when he's invited to actually sing on stage. It's a magical, fun-filled world of learning for children ages 5 to 10. Three richly animated, original stories of the Wild Zeep provide children with hours of entertainment. The Zeep is a good natured animal brought to life by your child's imagination. In addition, your child will learn valuable lessons about friendship, caring and perseverance. It includes an interactive glossary of words and definitions to help young readers expand their vocabulary and develops reading skills.

A typical full-motion video game of the nineties, it features 360? horizontal panning of some locations and easy puzzles for its target audience (mostly comprised of children).Published and produced by the computer game branch of the documentary channel Discovery, the focus is obviously on didactic elements: a small scientific facts database is integrated as a button to the interface, and can be accessed at any moment in the game. It plays animations and videos of hurricanes and other weather phenomena. It also contains clues to the solution of some of the puzzles. In an effort to further dispel any attempt at any meaningful amount of challenge, a hint button is provided on the interface at the bottom, placed between the inventory and the volume control and a compass.Gameplay is the standard fare of this type of game: instead of Myst's focus on mechanical puzzles, most are inventory-based. There are some short arcade sequences that need to be completed to advance the game.</desc>

The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher levels were designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.</desc>

		<desc>The Adventures of Hyperman is an educational point-and-click adventure game that teaches science through puzzles. A cartoon series inspired by the game later aired on CBS.
The plot of the game is very simple, the two bad guys, Entrobe and Kid Chaos, are loose and try to bring chaos to the earth by adulterating and messing up with the environment properties of the planet, so it's up to Hyperman and his side-kick Emma to stop them by solving different puzzles in which they are gonna need to know some things about different concepts of science.
The puzzle types are very varied, from simple mini-games to more thinking oriented puzzles. As in every point-and-click adventure game you have your inventory, essential to solve the puzzles, though there aren't different cursors for different actions.</desc>

		<name>The Adventures of Ninja Nanny &amp; Sherrloch Sheltie: No. 11 Downing Street</name>
		<desc>No. 11 Downing St. is an interactive novel for pre-teens and teenagers. It narrates the adventures of Ninja Nanny, a mischievous cow in search of her heritage, and her companion Sherrlock Sheltie. The story leads to animated sequences that introduce a host of unusual fiends and foes as Baron Von Moribund trails Ninja Nanny through San Francisco, London, and the Cotswolds. "No. 11 Downing St. uses sidebars to emphasize clues to the overall mystery of Ninja Nanny's heritage, give local color to a scene, or develop more richly the emerging relationship between the two main characters. The text contains hot-words and phrases that link to the DictioPedia which explains words, ideas, and settings. No. 11 Downing St. is full of double entendres and puns, as you would expect from a company that calls itself Silicon Alley. Graphics often resemble turn-of-the-century clip art. Clicking on various objects causes items to move and entertain the user. For example, clicking on the bumper stop of a loading dock in chapter three reveals that it reads 'The truck stops here - H. Truman, Postmaster.' Looking up Truman in the DictioPedia indicates that he once went bankrupt and served heroically in World War I. One can see footage of the war and then see one of Truman's most trying moments, firing General Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War. The user can also see MacArthur make his famous 'I shall return' speech.</desc>

		<name>The Adventures of Pinocchio</name>
		<desc>This is an interactive movie game based on the 1996 live action movie by the same name. After Pinocchio realizes his dream of becoming a real boy, the evil Lorenzini kidnaps him and turns him back into a puppet. You must help Pinocchio's creator, Geppetto, find and rescue him.  You'll go through Pinocchio's home town, row a boat through monster-infested waters and visit Terra Magica, the fair where Lorenzini turns boys into donkeys. To succeed, you'll have to dodge deadly traps, solve puzzles and outwit Lorenzini's conniving henchmen. Sometimes, you'll have to turn yourself into a puppet, a fish, a bird or even a donkey to rescue Pinocchio.  Along the way you must collect six passwords, each reflecting a lesson in morality that Pinocchio learns. You are aided by live-action guides Lumina and Candlewick who will offer different suggestions as to what to do but you must decide.  There are plenty of wide-screen scenes from the movie and a ton of original footage. The game comes on 4 CDs (''The Village'', ''The Forest'', ''The Sea'', and ''Terra Magica'') because of the FMV (though the video takes up only half the screen), each disk representing another world to explore.  You must make plot choices and solve puzzles through clicking on the interface around the FMV or on the FMV itself. It allows for microphone input also through voice recognition technology that allows the user to control the events on the screen through voice alone.</desc>

		<desc>The Adventures of Valdo &amp; Marie is an educational game for kids. The player takes the role of Valdo who is aboard a 16th century Portuguese ship heading for Japan. On the journey, they will explore exotic lands and deal with pirates, sharks, and storms. The main objective of the game is to gather the scattered pieces of a treasure map and reveal a mysterious adventure. Most of the gameplay consists of the usual adventure activities: searching the environment, collecting items and solving puzzles. Most of them are of the classic item based kind but there are also a few dialogue and logic puzzles. Additionally the player has to solve a few action based mini games, e.g. a Soko-Ban or a Lemmings variant. It is possible to bypass some puzzles entirely which has a impact later in the game: either getting stuck without the possibility of going back or receiving another of the nine endings.The educational part of the game consists mostly of the historically accurate foundation of the story and the environment. There are also many additional information in text form to read. Some puzzles require this knowledge to be solved, e.g. about ship speed.</desc>

		<name>The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble</name>
		<desc>After a devastating atomic war, the world population was nearly annihilated, and the survivors had to hide deep underground. In the meantime, a peaceful race of human-like creatures, the boozooks, populated the Earth. After the humans ascended to the surface again, they started a bloody war against this race. The boozooks were mercilessly destroyed, their culture demolished, and in the end of the war they were enslaved by humans.The vertical, economically self-sufficient city of Vlurxtrznbnaxl was erected, controlled by a corrupt leader known as BigWig, who oppressed population with heavy taxes and freedom restrictions. The genius Professor Azimuth, sympathetic to the cause of the boozooks, has discovered a mysterious object or entity known as the Schnibble, which apparently could bring peace and prosperity to the world. However, BigWig's henchmen kidnap the professor and even shoot a teddy bear that belongs to his little adopted half-boozook son Woodruff. Applying a device called Viblefrotzer to himself, Woodruff physically ages fifteen years, and feels strong enough to begin a search for his foster father and find a way to dethrone BigWig.Woodruff is an adventure game with a cartoon-like appearance and many tricky puzzles, similar in art style and design to the Gobliiins series by the same creators. Unlike Gobliiins, this is a full-fledged adventure where the player character can move around freely, explore the large city, and interact with many characters. The interaction with the environment is done with a simple point-and-click system, without separate verb commands. The majority of the puzzles are inventory based; beside items, Woodruff can also use various spells (such as, for example, levitation) as well as ancient boozook formulae, which he has to learn and collect in order to advance in the game.</desc>

		<name>The Complete MAUS</name>
		<desc>Explore the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel in ways never before possible with this special interactive CD-ROM edition. The Complete MAUS combines Volumes I and II with sketches, video, and supplementary documents to give the reader a unique look at this moving work. When it first appeared in 1986, MAUS, Art Spiegleman's memoir of his father's experiences during the Holocaust, was hailed as a powerful work of history. It represented a new level of maturity for a century-old art form; namely comix, which to that point had mostly been a medium for superhero fantasies and funny animal stories. With the appearance of MAUS, the point was made simply and clearly that a comixture of words and pictures could be used to portray any subject matter 0 even one so fare removed from the traditional comix subject matter as the genocide and persecution of Polish and German Jews during the years surrounding the Second World War. The Complete MAUS CD-ROM grants the user unprecedented access to the historical and structural details behind the finished book. The pages of MAUS are linked to preliminary sketches, alternate drafts, archival photographs, and drawings made by prisoners and audio from the interviews between Art Spiegelman and his father that were the basis for the narrative. In addition, there is QuickTime video and audio of Art Spiegelman discussing the making of MAUS, and critical commentary on the form, ideas, and history behind this powerful, groundbreaking work.</desc>

Your buddies rescue you from the lab so that you can go exploring - scavenging the galaxy for wreckage and artifacts left over from the war. In due course you stumble literally into an alien craft. With your own craft disabled, and the alien ship on a collision course, you must explore it to find out what has gone wrong and to make a course correction. Gameplay consists of conversations with your colleagues (displayed as live action video), animated exploration sequences, as well as puzzle-solving that mostly involves figuring out how to operate alien mechanisms. There is also a maze sequence and sporadic action-based tasks. There is no inventory to speak of, because, being a brain in a box. you have no pockets.All the action takes place in an in-game window that is your view of the world. It takes up only a small part of the screen and the rest of the screen is taken up with a kind of fleshy 'inside of your head' background that is there to remind you that you are inside a machine. Three difficulty settings, in-game instruction and assistance, as well as a few extras (such as high-resolution pictures) are included.</desc>

This controls the strength of the putt. The second control is a white circle in a grey square. The white circle represents the ball and, using the mouse, the player positions a green dot which marks the direction from which the club will strike the ball. With the force and direction of the shot determined the player uses the third control to initiate the shot. An animation in the main window shows the track of the ball. Each player has a total of eight strokes with which to complete the hole after which control passes to the next player. Should the ball go into a bunker the ball is replaced at the start point. The object of the game is to complete the course in as few shots as possible.Apart from the entry of the players names the game is entirely mouse controlled.

		<desc>This game involves puzzle solving, while creating wacky machines.  Each level of the game contains a machine designed to do a specific task.  The only problem is, there are parts missing, and it is your job to figure out where to put what in order to get the machine to work.  The game features many wacky machine parts, including cats, super balls, lava lamps, flashlights, can openers, monkeys on treadmills, and many more wacky parts to get your machine working.  The game also comes with an editor to let you design your own unique machines from scratch.  These can either be for fun, or you can set it so that the person playing has to fill in the missing parts, just like in the campaign.</desc>

		<name>Journeyman Project, The: Turbo!</name>
		<desc>The Journeyman Project: Turbo! is a remake of The Journeyman Project. The year is 2318. The place: the sky-born city of Caldoria. After a century of bitter struggle, humanity has finally learned to live in peace. In 2117 the Unified World was established. And humanity knew no more war.But all that was achieved was threatened with the invention of time travel. Its potential to destroy humanity's hard won prosperity realized, the only time travel machine ever built, the Pegasus, was moved to a secret location. The Temporal Security Annex (TSA) was formed to protect history from sabotage. The project's code name: Journeyman.Today is 11.6.2318. Exactly ten years ago, an alien delegation calling themselves the Cyrrollans approached earth as messengers from the Symbiotry of Peaceful Beings. They gave humanity ten years to decide if the want to join the Symbiotry or not. Now the moment has come, and humanity awaits the arrival of the alien delegation.You are Agent 5 of the Temporal Protectorate. When you report to the TSA, you find that someone is changing history, influencing events and happenings, changing how things happened - and not for the better. It is your job to find out who is messing with history, stop him, and restore history.  For this you will have to travel time, using the Pegasus, as far as 2 million BC. You will travel to Mars in 2185 to stop attack on an alien vessel, visit the World Science Center in 2310 to stop an assassination, and go back to 2112 to destroy a nuclear missile. You will collect items, solve puzzles, and pit your wits against a giant robot.The game itself is an adventure game, played in 1st person perspective - explore the environment, collect and use items, solve puzzles and small games, and it even has a maze in it. It has a few twists though: according to TSA's rules, you are not allowed to interact with people from a different time, so you must gather information in a different way. You can also stay only a limited time in every time zone, since you protective suit has only limited energy. You can also die at this game, if you are not fast thinking and fast moving.</desc>

		<desc>If you want to explore the literary magic of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle book, this software provides kids with a narrated line-by-line text. An animated version of Mowgli, the jungle boy raised by wolves, dances in the opening screen - very similar to the dancing characters in the Living Book series. Kids can also read the facts on author Rudyard Kipling and guide their way through a photo tour of India, most of this information is available on CD-ROM encyclopedias. A Top Banana game features a slingshot, equipped with a banana. Kids use their mouse to aim the banana-powered slingshot at hungry jungle monkeys who swing from tree to tree. When their aim is on target, a screen message proclaims ''You are Top Banana''. In the New Adventures of Mowgli section, kids can select from a 3-part screen, some of which features live action digital video. Clicking on the moving feet icons and you can learn some facts about jungle animals on split-screen videos. There is a section of the game that is something of an interactive movie in that you can guide Mowgli as he travels through the jungle and find a cave which is the home of a villain that is so evil we never learn his name. The whole segment lacks speech and a story, and is mostly just a glorified tour of the jungle and its animals. Even so, it is an interactive movie since it is possible for Mowgli to get killed when he faces the villain which results in a bad ending for his adventure.</desc>

		<name>The Liberation of Kuwait</name>
		<desc>In the early '90s, the general public had been fed a great deal of propaganda about the fierceness of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, one of the top fighting forces in the world -- though, as it turns out, one with a glaring vulnerability to air power.  In their successful attempt to oust the Iraqi army from Kuwait (being careful to leave Saddam in power) through an overwhelming display of power, the coalition of the West in operation Desert Storm soon found their grizzled opponents only too eager to surrender and save their hides.  This program commemorates their efforts, indicating a line of happily compliant soldiers, alive, in mental contrast to the stilled parade of ''crispy critters'' along the turkey shoot of the Highway of Death back to Basra.To drive home the point of what a straw man the opposing forces ended up being, the program runs through to completion upon execution without any input needed from the player; however, if the author was more prescient, he might have instructed the program to lie dormant for twelve years and then fire up some horrifying no-win program like Forbidden.exe or Punishment for what John McCain suggests might be ten thousand years.</desc>

But his leisurely life gets interrupted as Nathan, son of the lunatic dentist Dr. Periowinkle, steals utensils from the magician Strangeblood and accidentally transforms the little girl Violet into a wombat.The player takes control of Pink Panther and has to travel to Israel, Indonesia, Siberia and Greece to find a counterspell. Of course he encounters many strange people and inventory based puzzles. Because the game is mainly aimed at children the puzzles are not too complicated and the controls are constrained to the left mouse button. During the course of the game the player can retrieve a lot of background information regarding history and lifestyle of the countries he has visited by accessing a special menu, but this is not necessary to complete the game. Of course some of the information gets addressed during the regular gameplay. There is a optional function included which gives hints or solutions for the puzzles when the player is stuck.</desc>

Both items are automatically filled as the plot progresses.Most of the gameplay consists of scuba diving and taking photos under the sea (the game was co-produced by the famous marine biologist Jean-Michel Cousteau) and talking to the crew of the ship Antares for clues.

Through 20 pages of comic book action, you'll click frame by frame as you guide The Tick through his adventure. Each panel is interactive via QuickTime clips lifted straight from the show, simple animations and "plot clues," which add to the content taken from the episode with original content exclusive to the game. The story involves the invasion of a disgusting alien from Dimension 14B called the Thrakkorzog who plans to take over Earth once he has created an army of mucus-based Tick clones. But first he needs a sample of the eight-foot superhero's DNA -- which isn't so easy to obtain from a nigh invulnerable one! It's up to The Tick (with a little help from his trusty sidekick Arthur) to save The City from one of its greatest (and definitely most grotesque) threats. SPOON!</desc>

		<name>THiNK-X</name>
		<desc>THiNK-X is a puzzle game in which you have to clear playing fields by matching identical objects in a limited amount of time. Items can be matched horizontally and vertically as doublets, or as triplets as long as three of a kind touch, but not diagonally. You have to plan carefully, as no objects are to remain at the end of the game. Items are moved by clicking them and assigning a new position on a horizontal line. If you make a mistake, you can rebuild the original lay-out, but time keeps running.There are 168 levels divided over 28 playing fields with 6 difficulty modes. An increased difficulty is not only reflected in the amount of time, but also by different blocks and items with special features, making all the levels unique. There are toys in the Easy mode, numbers in Medium, letters in Hard and Extreme, coloured ducks in Funny, and in Tricky you play with vases that turn into blocks when matched.Certain levels include special pieces. Marplots can be used to block shooters that destroy pieces, weakies slowly fade causing items on top to fall down, and bridges are temporary structures over which you can move pieces in the air. Elementals temporarily hold pieces, or are used to get rid of marplots, while shooters completely destroy items. There are also moving bridges, called wanderers, timebombs (similar to weakies, but with a destructive effect), elevators to transport items to the top of the level and switches that alter the playing field.</desc>

		<name>Titanic: Adventure Out of Time</name>
		<desc>Titanic: Adventure Out of Time is an open-ended first-person adventure game set on the doomed maiden voyage of the HMS Titanic. The player takes the role of Frank Carlson, a disgraced British secret service agent. His career having ended after he failed in a mission on board the HMS Titanic, he now lives in a small apartment, surrounded by mementos of his past. Somehow, however, Carlson is thrown backward into his past to April of 1912, giving the player an opportunity to change the events on board the doomed ship. While the player is not able to avert the sinking of the Titanic, they are able to influence not only Frank's timeline but that of the other passengers on board the ship and, indeed, the progression of subsequent human history. As a result, details of the game's plot are affected by the player's actions, which can result in one of any number of significant or minutely different endings.The game is a puzzle-solving adventure game which utilizes a simple, point-and-click system in order for the player to interact with the world. While the game is played in the form of a traditional adventure game, it expands on this established system by constructing its game play around the idea of a continuous, transitory world. While the player still progresses through the game primarily through solving puzzles and interacting with other characters it presents these interactions as taking place within an active, malleable world. Characters, for instance, periodically move about the ship, and can be found in different portions of the ship during different times of day as they pursue their lives apart from the player. Puzzles are similarly tied to this progression of time, and players may choose to pursue plot lines how ever they think is best, influencing both the plot and other puzzles within the game, allowing them to completely overlook or pass over entire puzzles and story points. Early in the game, for instance, the player is asked to locate an item hidden by another character. If they're able to discover its location early enough, they can take the item from its hiding spot before someone else does. If they're sidetracked by other characters within the world, or in some other way too slow in locating the object, the hiding spot will be empty and the plot will accommodate this development. It is important to note, however, that the game does not progress in real-time as other adventures, such as The Last Express, do. Rather, time progresses due to the player solving a puzzle or in some other way advancing the game.In addition to the traditional puzzles within the game, there are also mini-games which the player can participate in either for fun or to influence the plot, such as poker and fencing.The game is presented using 3D graphics, although the player still moves through the game by shifting from screen to screen, similar in style to the movement found in other adventure titles such as Riven. The bottom of the screen features a nautically-themed interface featuring a life preserver (the menu), a pocket watch (which represents the in-game time), a rolled piece of parchment (a map of the ship), and a leather case (the inventory).</desc>

There are rocks to crush, skyscrapers to build, and roads to pave spread throughout the five environments of Tonka Land.  Fourteen different virtual Tonka vehicles are available to accomplish these tasks and as projects are completed, the player earns printable certificates to show off their construction skills.  Ultimately, a child who completes all seven projects earns the title of ''Master Builder'' and the respect of the Tonka team.Although not overtly billed as educational software, Tonka Construction does emphasize learning how to follow a design plan and how to select the right tool (truck) to resolve a problem.  As a bonus, virtual 3D Tonka trucks are much safer than the sharp cornered metal Tonka toys responsible for so many childhood injuries in the 70s (although they aren't as much fun to use in the sandbox).</desc>

		<name>Torin's Passage</name>
		<desc>Torin is a young boy who lives in a little country house on a planet called Strata with his parents and with his purple cat-like friend Boogle. One day he returns home, only to find out his parents were imprisoned in a magical spell. Apparently, the spell was cast by a sorceress named Lycentia. He must now travel to distant lands to find a way to remove the spell and confront the sorceress. What he doesn't know is that this journey will also help him to discover his true origins and his true purpose in life...Created by Al Lowe of Leisure Suit Larry fame, Torin's Passage is a fairy tale-like humorous adventure with cartoon-style graphics and animations. Torin interacts with characters and objects in a point-and-click fashion, and can also use Boogle's special shape-shifting abilities. During their journey, Boogle will learn how to turn into a variety of objects, which is essential for solving many of the game's puzzles. The game also has many traditional inventory-based tasks as well as other types of puzzles. To facilitate the puzzle-solving, the game has a built-in hint system; using the hints will deduce points from the player's score.</desc>

The storyline goes as follows: You've spent every last penny of your money buying an expensive music video production tower and having it blasted off into another dimension.  In order to complete the game you must earn enough money (minimum of $1 million) to blast your tower back home. To earn money you must make music videos. Dozens of songs and video clips are provided for you, and you must construct a ''bonzai'' video that one of three music TV producers would like and strike deals with them.  But sometimes the clips and songs given don't cut it, and you must venture out into the world and film different clips yourself.  Every once in a while you must have a duel to the death with a guitar monster. You also must recruit singers for your videos to improve your song quality, singers such as Johnny Fang and Edgar Death.  All in all its a very large game with weeks of playing time.</desc>

		<desc>Tower is a game whereby the player can become an air traffic controller. The main objective is to ensure the safe passage of landing and departing aircraft. All aircraft activity is reported to the text-based console and can be heard on the radio, awaiting player response. Communicate orders directly to the pilot from the tower console, warn of any dangers or tell them to use another runway (if available). Try to operate one of three airports or take on a whole scenario, which gradually progresses from a typical airport to O'Hare in Chicago, one of the busiest in the world. Each scenario offers flexibility to select a time of day, the number of runways and the rate of traffic with a maximum of 150 planes every two minutes.The main view outside of the tower is a total 3D 360-degree display. Switch to tracking or binoculars displays to closer watch planes. Several instruments help to make more informed decisions such as a compass, wind gauges, a clock, and a panel of shortcut buttons for quick and easy access to different functions from control over lights, arrival and departure details, bright display Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE), and viewing angles.Points are earned for the ability to manage issuing commands, while they are lost for runway separations or crashes, the ultimate aim being to gain highly sought-after perks including the award for controller-of-the-month, time-off with pay or paycheck bonus.Multi-player games are possible over a modem or null-modem cable to owners of Microsoft Flight Simulator v5.1, enabling a pilot (second player) to come in to land at the player's airport.*Follows FAA and Transport Canada rules.</desc>

You are in charge of the air traffic in a certain sector, making sure that every airplane gets to his destination safely. Your main screen is a radar, which features the aircrafts as green dots or little airplanes, moving at a certain speed at a certain height.The more traffic is in the air, the more hectic your job becomes. You have to set routes for the planes and organize punctual arrivals. The game is also featuring emergencies, to make your task more difficult. Tracon was used to train professional ATCs in the early nineties. Then Wesson decided to develop special simulation units for professional users and continue the Tracon series as entertainment.</desc>

No surprise Hard mode is the fastest. From this menu you can also enable or disable sound effects, using the check box. Here we go now, playing with the mouse : right click to toss the clay pigeon into the air, then, aim the crosshairs and left click to fire at the target. A round ends after 25 targets.Two last things: the registered version has no 'nag screens' ; running on recent computers, the game is way too fast, even in Easy mode. So consider using a slowdown utility.</desc>

The Master of Mischief was removed from Treasure Cove, and goes to Crystal City in deep space. He turns some asteroids into destructive Disasteroids, attacks Crystal City and shatters its crystals. The Super Solvers are called to recover the crystal shards and save the city. The goal is to recover all crystals and bring them back to the queen in her palace. This is done by first capturing animated fireballs called ''sunbeams''. If you answer their riddles correctly, they will help you decode a cipher that must be cracked in order to get the crystals hidden in the satellites. Each stage will have a different cipher that goes toward all the satellites in it. There's a different 4-digit passcode for each of three separate stages. Kids aded 5-9 will use math and critical-thinking skills to measure everyday objects, arrange geometric shapes, identify calendar dates, do basic fractions and more. The difficulty of each separate category of puzzle changes depending on how well the player does with that type of puzzle.</desc>

		<desc>The famous story of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island contains pirates, buried treasures and high sea adventures. With narration and live video, children can interact with the characters and participate in the adventures. There's very little actual game afoot here - the entire story plays out in badly-animated CG clips of a talking skull, except when he's a live-action badly-synched talking skull. There's audio narration over still images and low-budget full motion video clips with the dialogue dubbed in later. In many of the live-action sequences, it appears that the acquired footage was damaged, or the script was changed, or (most likely) there just wasn't enough footage to cover the dialogue. So much of the story is told using still frames or repeated clips to support the post-dubbed dialogue. Oh, the drama! The low-budget production values! The cheesy video effects!</desc>

Your goal is to locate the magic crown and as many of the treasures as possible while climbing your way to the top. To make your way up the mountain, you will need to find keys which unlock a path. The keys are hidden somewhere behind an object on each level of the mountain. To find out what is behind an object you need to use one of your magic coins. However, the number of coins you have is limited and there are many places to search so you first need to find clues as to where keys (and treasures!) are located. Wandering about the mountain are numerous elves; if you catch a scroll carrying elf in your net, he'll ask a question. A correct answer will provide a clue. After reaching the top of the multi-leveled mountain, all the treasures you collected along the way will be put back in the treasure chest, and you begin again at the bottom with a tougher difficulty level. After all treasures have been brought to the top, you can find the crown and win the game!</desc>

Smiley bricks: These bricks are returning the ball just the same way it came.  Water bricks: Hitting these bricks will make you lose the ball.  Key bricks: These bricks gives you a key that you needed to open locks.  Lock bricks: These bricks can be opened if a key is at hand.  Racket bricks: Gives you an extra life.  Blue G-bricks: The ball is glued to the paddle for some time until you press mouse button or time has run out. This function will stay active until another special tile is hit.  Blue L-bricks: The ball is locked and can be set free for double-ball play when hit again.  Grey arrow bricks: If hit twice this brick will produce a permanent brick at the bottom of the screen and by this confine your racket movements to one side of the screen for few seconds.  Red F-bricks: If a blocker is present the paddle will be turned into a gun for a few seconds allowing you to destroy the blocker.  Green S-bricks: Hitting these bricks will remove one of the stamps covering the cartoons. The faster you remove these bricks the more points you get.

		<name>UltraVixen</name>
		<desc>One day Ariel, an ordinary schoolgirl, is left after the classes by her biology teacher. The teacher, a pervert, as every girl in the school seems to know, seduces Ariel. While he does it, he is transformed into the Overlord, a creature who seduces and tortures girls and young women. As Ariel reaches her climax a portal opens dragging her 900 years into the future. There she learns of Overlord's time portals, through which he has set up a series of erotic torture dens for young girls across time and space.  Ariel now becomes an Ultra Vixen and she decides to use her Superclimax power to disrupt the continuum and seal Overlord's temporal access. To do so Ariel will have to channel herself into the minds of sexually tortured victims and reach the climax. The game is divided into 3 levels: WWII Germany, present time Tokyo subway train and distant future. Each level is divided into several stages; the goal of each stage is to get Ariel's sexual excitement to the maximum using various tools at hand. Using right tools will add some points to the score and move the story forward, while using tools that Ariel currently dislikes may deduct the points from the score and ultimately bring the game to Game Over. Most actions are done by selecting a tool and rapidly moving it back and forth for some time. The heroine and the tools are in 3D.</desc>

This is a typical platformer. The player walks and jumps through the six levels and punches his enemies to defeat them. To avoid certain enemies or bullets he can dodge by ducking.

		<desc>It is not easy to find this ''point and click'' adventure game. The whole game is a constant search for paths through the mazelike environments. During almost all the time, you will seek the signs - artifacts and keys which will open way to find more keys and artifacts, and new realms. Doing so you will be able to trace the ''Ancient Travelers'' who were messing around long before... Maybe you will find them... So, this is the plot... The game features 16 bit stereo, surround music and sound effects, and graphic art  (full screen 3D). You can even ''explore'' the CD as a music CD....The game can  be played in one of two modes :  1) ''Challenging'' (you have to find everything that is to be found), or ... 2) ''Explore'' where keys are given - and you ''just'' have to look for the doors...</desc>

		<name>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?</name>
		<desc>Carmen Sandiego is a master thief who leads the criminal organization V.I.L.E. This organization specializes in stealing the world's treasures without a trace. Alarmed by this, the A.C.M.E. Detective Agency makes it their personal mission to foil Carmen Sandiego's plans.

Carmen Sandiego is an game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away. Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.</desc>

Furthermore, since ''most'' crimes are solved within 6 hours, the city is demanding this case be wrapped up within that limit.Who Killed Sam Rupert is a multimedia full-motion-video detective game. Players assume the role of the investigating detective and must search the area, and zoom in, via a 1st person adventure game interface for clues and interview witnesses. Each action eats up a designated amount of time, and after 6 hours, the case is over and the player must explain what they've found at a press conference in order to get a chance at arresting the guilty party from a narrowed down list of 3 suspects. There are three possible ''motives'' for the case and thus three possible endings in solving the murder of Sam Rupert.</desc>

This game is not about shooting blocks and blowing things up it's about strategically adding bricks to the shapes as they fall to form larger, rectangular shapes and thus generate more points. For example overlapping blocks can, if completed in the right order, be cleared as a single unit.Once a block has been completed it disappears and the player's score increases.  If any block hits the ground it's game over.</desc>

Anything that exits the screen on one side,  will enter the screen on the other. This includes your own shots. Apart from the random enemy UFOs, there are also randomly appearing bonus crates containing extra lives, weapon upgrades and shield generators.

Kirk, commander of the original NCC-1701 Enterprise, is ordered to stop that invasion.WinTrek is Star Trek simulation game, where the player virtually controls every aspect of the Enterprise, including those that would normally be done by the crew.For navigating the Enterprise through the sectors and quadrants, the player does not ''drive'' her, but instead controls the navigation station directly (setting course, whereby any of the 360 degrees can be used, and setting speed limits, both impulse and warp). During combat, the player has to manage shields, coordinate phaser fire and photon torpedoes, including the control of how much dilithium (fuel) is invested into shields and weapons. Finally, the player must manage the dilithium fuel (i.e. refilling at starbases) and make sure that the ship doesn't break apart (damage system).The game is won when the enemy armada is destroyed, and lost when the armada attacks Earth, or when the player-controlled ship runs out of fuel or explodes. Both the number of enemy ships and the days available to the player are randomly set when the game is started. The game offers six difficulty levels, ranging from Admiral (expert) to Expandable Crewman (easiest). In-game Computer Station acts like a computer operation system, allowing the player to get information not visible at the other stations (e.g. retrieve the position of the starbases). Information is displayed in 11 sub-windows of the game window, which are all re-sizable and movable.</desc>

One or two kids create their on-screen alter-egos who venture into games shows like ''Go Figure,'' a take-off on ''Celebrity Squares'' where the celebs try to stump players with their own meanings of figures of speech. More word play in ''Meet Your Match'' pieces word parts in search of the defined term.</desc>

		<name>World Empire II</name>
		<desc>The World Empire series moved to Windows in the second game of the series. It's a game of global domination, like Risk, except that there are no cards to award bonus armies. Each player represents an ideology ? Populist, Militarist, Socialist or Realist. The world is divided into 139 nations, each of which supports one of the players' ideologies. When you conquer a nation that supports your ideology, they greet you as liberators and require only 1 army to hold them, whereas nations that support rival ideologies need additional armies to remain in order to prevent a revolution. Armies are awarded at the beginning of each turn based on the number of nations held, plus bonus armies for holding an entire continent. World Empire II adds an ''all nations conquered'' option, in addition to the ''all nations neutral'' starting position of the original. Populations and national capitals are now listed for each country. Starting with v1.5, the game became ''Deluxe'' because it adds a real world simulation mode to the registered version, in which population and development are taken into account. Version 1.5 also adds an option to have all sides start with 30 armies instead of 56, and to check the status of all countries on the continent. The shareware version can be played by one to four players, with up to two computer players (one in v1.0). The registered version can be played against up to seven computer opponents, and adds three new ideologies.</desc>

		<desc>World Empire III is a Risk-like strategy game where the ultimate goal is world conquest.  Up to eight human/computer players are assigned a starting country, either at random or by selection.  There are some 139 real world nations to choose from.Each country is assigned an ideology. Nations with the same ideology as yours will be easier to conquer and occupy, while nations with different ideologies will put up greater resistance. Ideological factions include the Populists, Militarists, Socialists, Realists, Pacifists, Optimists, Pessimists, and Feminists.There are two modes of play: Standard and Real World Simulation. The Standard game plays out similarly to Risk. Real World Simulation mode adds a number of details, including population, industrial/agricultural/gasoline production, infantry/mechanized/tactical air support, and less randomness in battle resolutions.</desc>

		<desc>The inhabitants of the island of Phoros used to enjoy a prosperous, happy life. Large domesticated insects known as ''jagtera'' were doing all the hard work for them. However, following the Darkfall, the jagtera have disappeared from the island. The quality of life on Phoros has drastically declined, and its nobles came up with a monstrous plan: spreading rumors about the return of jagtera, they poisoned the population with a nectar that turned them into vicious, uncontrollable replicas of these gentle creatures. When a wandering squire named Warrick arrives on Phoros, searching for his missing sister, he realizes that something must be done to stop the pestilence. He does not known that he may have to leave his humanity by the wayside and succumb to the plague himself...Entomoprh is the second computer game set in the fictional world of Aden, the first being Thunderscape. Though the two games share the same setting, their gameplay styles are quite different. Entomoprh is predominantly an action game with very light role-playing and puzzle-solving elements. The squire explores the island, talks to inhabitants, gathers clues and necessary items, and ventures into hostile areas to fight enemies. Combat is action-oriented and is done either with physical attacks or spells. There are no weapons in the game: Warrick either fights using his fists or morphs into different creatures by drinking special potions, thus acquiring new attacks. There are no character statistics or experience system of any kind.The monster-morphing comes with a prize: Warrick is slowly turning into a jagtera. The player may control his actions and decisions throughout the game, ultimately affecting the ending, which determines whether the hero has resisted a complete transformation or not.</desc>

		<path>./eXoWin3xConverted/Yellow Brick Road (1996).pc</path>
		<name>Yellow Brick Road</name>
		<desc>Inspired by the Oz Books by L. Frank Baum, Yellow Brick Road concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King. Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow. Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz. The game's structure is reminiscent of first-person adventures: the player interacts with the environment and manipulates inventory items to proceed. The puzzles, however, are kept to a minimum, since combat occupies a significant portion of the game, effectively turning it into a hybrid of adventure and small-scale real-time strategy.Battles usually occur as dictated by the plot. The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his/her companions. Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game. Many of the items act differently depending on who uses them. For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow.  The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again. The enemies progress toward the companions' side of the battlefield at a constant pace.  If they reach them, the battle is lost, and the player must try again.  If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field, the battle is won and the game progresses. Different enemies are more greatly affected by different weapon/character combinations, and immune against some.</desc>

		<name>ZAARK and the Night Team: The Quest for Patterns</name>
		<desc>Zaark and the Night Team: The Quest for Patterns is filled with puzzles for kids to solve. Four games are included that use different types of patterns to solve puzzles. When a puzzle is solved during each game the story advances as the player continues on their way to completing a quest. ''Save Melody Castle'' is all about music. Using listening skills one must choose which notes are high and which are low. ''Nab the Scrambler'' educates children about art. While inside an art museum the player must look at paintings and remove items that do not belong. Through the use of a time machine the artist of the picture arrives to help the player. After a picture is fixed other paintings by that artist can be viewed. ''Rescue on Hoolie-Goolie Island'' teaches the concept of patterns with shapes and numbers. The player must look at a row of numbers or shapes and fill in the missing piece. ''Aid to the aliens'' matches words with pictures. For example, match the word valley with a picture of a valley.</desc>

		<desc>SimCity 2000 is the successor to the ground breaking city simulation game Sim City. You are once again the mayor, but this time you can fully customize the terrain before building your city. The graphics are isometric, whereas the original had graphics displayed in a top-down fashion.

This title adds numerous features over the original such as the ability of building ''light'' zones, subways, hospitals, colleges, zoos, and arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.

Develop and build your own city! This collection includes SimCity 2000, SimCity 2000 Scenarios Volume 1: Great Disasters, SimCity 2000 Bonus Cities and Scenarios, and the Urban Renewal Kit which allows you to build your own cities free of charge and them import them into the game!</desc>

		<path>./eXoWin3xConverted/SimPark (1996).pc</path>
		<name>SimPark</name>
		<desc>Made by Maxis, the company famous for its line of ''Sim'' games, SimPark deals with the simulation and management of a real wildlife park.  SimPark allows you to build and manage parks from scratch, completely isolated from civilization.  You have the choice of choosing from hundreds of different species of flowers, bushes, plants, mammals, birds, and reptiles to live and thrive in your park.  Which plants and animals to put in is completely your choice, but you have to make sure that their biological needs are met so that they won't die.  You start out with a bare patch of land, but as you add plants and animals, it will begin to grow.  Depending on the climate and food available, certain animals will even begin migrating to your park.  SimPark contains a massive database of plants and animals that you need to use in order for your park to flourish.  Over hundreds of species are cataloged in SimPark, and each article includes a brief bio, their scientific name, their wants and needs, and even an authentic recording of what each animal sounds like.  You need to utilize this information to figure out what plants and animals to put in your park, in order for the creatures to flourish.  If a creature or plant does not get enough food, a plant does not like the climate, or trees do not get the amount of water they need, your park will not grow.When plants and animals are placed incorrectly, the park becomes unstable.  Weeds and animals will begin to overpopulate the park.  Other trees will die or get overeaten by rampaging species.  Because of this, the game tries to teach the concept of a ''balanced ecosystem.''  It is up to you to have an understanding of the animals in your park to preserve a balance.  Only through a perfectly balanced biological system can all of the creatures flourish.Besides the biological aspect, there is also the managerial aspect of it.  Above all, it is up to you to manage the budget for the park.  Planting trees and adapting animals costs money, and if you can't manage that money, you're fired.  Even though you get federal funding each year, it is also important to attract visitors to the park to make a little income.  You need to make provisions for humans, like paths and bathrooms.  You also have to make sure visitors behave and do not litter or ravage the park.  Besides this, you also have the duty to identify species in your park, through a mini-game which has you identify them through their characteristics.  As well, you may  have to decide on other things like if you want to receive donations, or cater to boyscout parties (which might have negative affects on the ecosystem).Like any classic Sim game, you can ravage your own park with disasters.  You can simulate a garbage dump disaster (a large pile of garbage and lots of rats), a fire, an alien invasion (pink and blue blobs that create garbage) and a kudzu infestation.</desc>

		<desc>Billed as ''the world's first interactive multimedia novel,'' this brilliantly fulfills the latter half of its claim (i.e. ?multimedia novel?) while dismally failing the first (i.e. ?interactive?). It's an art film whose commercial value arises from the novelty of the medium. Based on the legend of the Paladin Roland, a knight in the service of Charlemagne, the tale of Madness of Roland is told from multiple points of view which you can select at will. Each character tells their own, often contradictory, version of the story. Roland uses text, digital color paintings, animation, QuickTime video, professional ''radio theatre'' narration, hypertextual links and a complete original soundtrack to transport you to the world of Charlemagne's France.</desc>
