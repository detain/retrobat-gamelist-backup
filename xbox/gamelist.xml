		<desc>A nanobot has been stolen from the work of a world-renowned scientist, Dr. Katya Nadanova, of the Oxford Department of Microtechnology by a man known only as "the General", and has kidnapped the girl as well.

Before long Bond is yet again called into action when MI6 loses contact with 003. And so Bond is off to Peru...</desc>

He is sent to Istanbul to acquire the Russian decoder machine known as the Lektor from a (supposedly) defecting Russian agent by the name of Tatiana Romanova. However, the Russians have no knowledge of this plan because it is a trap for James Bond created by the criminal organization known as Octopus. It is up to James Bond to seize the device and confront the dangerous assassin Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb.</desc>

		<name>Advent Rising</name>
		<desc>Advent Rising is a sci-fi shooter with a storyline penned by author Orson Scott Card, whose video game credits include The Dig and the Monkey Island series of adventure games. Advent Rising tells the story of a supposedly peaceful race called the Seekers. The setting takes place in a universe where planets have banded together to shape future policy and promote goodwill throughout the galaxy. It is a universe where members of an intergalactic council have appointed the Seekers as overseers in the development of new civilizations before these planets are permitted to join the esteemed council. Yet the Seekers are not as diplomatic as they seem. Another species has learned of a sinister plot by the Seekers to eliminate the human race.
 

A small band of human freedom fighters, led by a man named Gideon Wyeth, plans to stop this form of genocide at all costs. Players assume the role of Gideon while exploring the 3D worlds from a third-person perspective. Advent Rising offers a variety of weapons with which to thwart the armies of Seekers, and players will also be able to commandeer vehicles and channel special mind powers for protection as well as offense. The first of a planned trilogy of titles, Advent Rising uses Epic Games' Unreal technology to create the worlds in which players must battle. Orson Scott Card has also written a companion novel to expand upon the ideas found in the game, which can be purchased at the time of Advent Rising's release.</desc>

		<name>Aggressive Inline</name>
		<desc>Combine the many tricks and styles of the extreme sport, inline skating, with a Tony Hawk style system, complete with objectives and huge arenas, and you have Aggressive Inline.

Progress through the career mode, where you must complete objectives (such as grind a certain object(s) to jump over large gaps and gain points) to open up further arenas, which there are 7 in all, and once your bored with them, you can make your own in the park editor. The game doesn't use a hard time limit but the so-called "juice meter": it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a "learning by doing" approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level which open up new areas within the level.</desc>

		<desc>The All-Star Baseball baseball video game series was developed and published by Acclaim Entertainment. The series began in 1997 with the release of All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas, the successor to Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball. New York Yankees play-by-play announcers John Sterling and Michael Kay were the announcers for 1998-2000 editions of the game. The final release in the series (due to the bankruptcy of Acclaim) is All-Star Baseball 2005.

Within the individual games, there are several different modes of play, such as exhibition, managing an existing Major League Baseball team or creating a team. Many North American cities are available for "expansion," in addition to Mexico City and Puerto Rico.

Most of the games feature Derek Jeter on the cover.</desc>

		<desc>In this adaptation of the film of the same name, the origins of the Batman legend are explored. Playing as both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, Batman, you will need to hunt evil forces in familiar locations such as Arkham asylum, Gotham City, but also in the Himalaya. Using both stealth and brutal skills, you take on enemies in true beat-em-up style. Batman has a vast array of moves, from kicks and punches to more exotic special moves. Multiple enemies can be attacked at once, and there are tricks to break through enemies' defenses. Also, certain attacks can only be used as a finishing move when opponents are weakened. Next to the melee combat, Batman carries his Bat Utility Belt with a Batgrapple to reach higher areas, the Batarang and gadgets such as smoke and flash grenades, a lockpick, camera hacker and an optical wire to peek from behind corners.</desc>

		<desc>Beyond Good &amp; Evil takes place in the year 2435 on the mining planet of Hillys, located in Sector Four, a remote section of the galaxy. The architecture of the city around which the game takes place was designed with a rustic European style. The world itself combines modern elements, such as e-mail and credit cards, with those of science fiction and fantasy, such as spaceships and anthropomorphic animals coexisting with humans. The once-peaceful planet is under siege by aliens called the DomZ that abduct beings and either drain their life force for power or implant them with spores to convert them into slaves. A military dictatorship called the Alpha Sections takes power, promising to defend the populace. However, the Alpha Sections seem unable to stop the DomZ despite their public assurances. An underground resistance movement, the IRIS Network, fights the Alpha Sections, believing them to be in league with the DomZ.</desc>

		<name>Blood Omen 2</name>
		<desc>The direct sequel to the original Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain and the fourth in the gothic series (which encompasses the Soul Reaver titles), Blood Omen 2 continues the adventures of the bloodthirsty vampire known as Kain. This third-person action-adventure takes place 400 years after the events in the first title. Killed at the hands of the Sarafan lord, Kain is resurrected and must now regain his memory as well as his powers before he can mete out his revenge.

As a vampire, Kain requires sustenance in the form of human blood. An onscreen blood meter (which doubles as Kain's health meter) drains continuously, requiring the antihero to feed on enemies or the hapless denizens populating the towns and villages in order to stay alive. Weaker enemies can be dispatched using his bare claws, while stronger enemies will be more easily defeated with the aid of clubs, axes, and long swords found along the journey. 

In addition to standard attacks, Kain is also capable of performing grab moves and stealth-kills, both of which are highlighted by a short cut-scene showing the gruesome death of his victim. Cinematic cut-scenes also introduce the game's many characters and flesh-out the plot. While Kain's blood meter starts out relatively small, it will gradually increase in size after consuming a victim's "lore" energy or by finding energy in special relics strewn about the world.

Blocking during combat increases Kain's rage meter, which upon being filled, allows him to unleash any of his combat-related Dark Gifts: special powers regained at critical junctures in his journey. Charm, for example, allows Kain to possess weak-willed citizens and force them to do his bidding, while Mist makes him invisible when surrounded by fog, allowing Kain to sneak around undetected. As more of these Dark Gifts are acquired, areas previously unreachable become accessible.

400 years have passed since the vampire Kain damned the world in the original Blood Omen, choosing to rule the world in damnation then die for it?s salvation. Now Kain, who once controlled the land of Nosgoth with his vampire armies, finds his brethren slain and his dark powers stripped by a mysterious figure. To reclaim his rule and exact his vengeance, Kain must dispatch armies of zealot soldiers and overcome legions of demons in order to uncover the ominous plot that threatens the land he seeks to conquer.</desc>

		<desc>Breakdown is unique in that it is technically categorized as a first-person shooter, but integrates the experiences of a fighting game into the experience as well as using auto-lock-on for shooting enemies. The viewpoint never leaves the perspective of the player, and interaction with objects, reloading of guns, and the impact of hitting the floor are all seen through this first-person perspective. Unlike other first-person shooters, interaction with objects is also all done in a realistic manner in Breakdown; ammunition is picked up by looking down and grabbing it with your arm instead of walking over it, similarly doors are opened by grabbing the handle, key cards used by swiping them over a scanner, ladders by using the arms for climbing and many others. Health and energy are replenished by consuming energy bars, sodas and hamburgers, which the player must eat while remaining in first person.</desc>

		<name>Burnout : Revenge</name>
		<desc>The fourth Burnout racing game puts you once again in the eye of traffic storms, where you do not only rush to be the fastest, but brutally, yet stylishly, take down your opponents. This is emphasized by impact time, which shows crashes in all their slowed-down glory, and the boost you receive after a successful wrecking. Reckless driving bumps your Revenge rank, unlocking new events. This can also be achieved by medal placings that grant new vehicles.</desc>

		<name>Burnout 2 : Point Of Impact</name>
		<desc>Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing. Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure. Designers have built city districts and surrounding areas, and implemented the race courses throughout the streets. As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races. As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving. Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost "burnout" meter. Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to drive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way. The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!</desc>

		<desc>In the second Call of Duty game for consoles, players again take to battle in The Second World War.  As with other Call of Duty games, the focus is on the characters and their drama amidst the furious, heavily scripted, first-person action.  As a private new to war in America's most legendary infantry division, nicknamed the Big Red One for the distinctive patch they wore, players will fight through the game as a team in the Fighting First and will be affected by the loss of friends on the battlefield.

Players will have to re-enact the successes of World War II through a wide variety of land, sea, and air missions in Africa, Sicily, and Normandy, by using vehicles including tanks, jeeps, armored cars, and half-tracks.  Success will depend on how well players can move, shoot, and complete the objectives that a commanding officer provides before each mission.

The Xbox and PS2 versions offer multiplayer games with up to 16 players.</desc>

		<desc>Colin McRae Rally and more recently; Dirt, is a racing video game series developed and published by Codemasters. Colin McRae Rally and Dirt 2 have since been developed and published for Mac OS X by Feral Interactive.

Started in 1998, the franchise has been a critical and commercial success and is generally acknowledged as a pioneer of realistic rally sports racing games. The series is named after the World Rally Championship driver Colin McRae, who provided technical advice during development.

Despite McRae's death in September 2007, Codemasters retained the use of his name on their rally games until the release of Dirt 3, where the moniker was dropped.</desc>

		<name>Conflict : Desert Storm</name>
		<desc>Conflict Desert Storm is a first-person/third-person shooter (the perspective can be switched by pressing a button), in which the player controls a squad of four soldiers from either the British S.A.S or American Delta Force during the first Gulf War. It has ideas borrowed from the book Bravo Two Zero and other real missions from the war. Missions are performed behind enemy lines and have specific objectives (infiltrate a base, destroy a SAM site, assassinate an opposing general, ...). Team members can be sent orders (attack, retreat, follow, stay, ...) or controlled individually. On the team is Bradley, the team leader, Conners, the heavy weapons man, Jones, the explosives and anti-tank expert, and Foley, the team sniper.  Each soldier has different skills that improve as they kill more enemies and gain experience. This results in them doing a better or faster job (Foley will have more stable aiming or Jones will plant C4 faster as their skills increase). In some missions, the player drives tanks or jeeps around while other squad members man the guns on the vehicle. At the end of each mission, the soldiers can be awarded medals for their bravery.</desc>

		<desc>The combat is often up close and very personal, although most levels seem to mix up the killzone areas giving a wide variety that support combat over many varying ranges. The Missions vary quite a bit too. Some are frenetic - fast paced where the team are fighting for their lives, others can be played at a much slower pace if desired. The level design really adds to counter-terrorism gameplay. The Team are often busting seiges using C4 to blow holes in walls and smoke grenades to flush the bad guys out.</desc>

The epic story has been split up in three parts, one for each character. While fighting, the characters learn new moves, collect items and earn rewards. Skills are improved according to your fighting style. Using specific attacks (e.g. unarmed) boosts the related skills, which can be leveled up. There are different flavours of weapons to be collected, from axes to  swords, spears and sabers, and even exotic variants such as falchion, firangi or gloive. New ones can be acquired during battle, but enemies can pick them up as well.</desc>

		<desc>Darkwatch is a first-person shooter set in the Wild West with supernatural beings. Fight your way through reapers, undead riflemen, banshees and other creatures using Darkwatch weaponry that doubles as melee weapons, such as a revolver, two-fisted pistols, a crossbow (with dynamite attached to the bolts) and a Rail Rocket. You will also find dynamite along the way to throw at the enemy and to destroy barricades. Along with conventional weapons, Cross will acquire vampire powers of good or evil nature that you must choose in the story. If you decide to be good, then you receive powers such as Silver Bullet that increases your shots with holy fire or Vindicator that calls down chain lightning on your enemies. If you choose to be evil, you will receive Blood Frenzy that makes melee attacks supernaturally powerful and Soul Stealer, which sucks the very souls from distant enemies. Regardless of good or evil, you will always have Blood Shield (protection from losing health), Vampire Jump (for those hard to reach areas) and Blood Vision (causes enemies, weapons and other important objects to glow). With every creature killed, there will be at least one Blood Cloud and sometimes more to replenish your health and restore your Vampire Powers.</desc>

		<desc>The game is somewhat unusual in that between levels, the player plays poker for extra health and ammunition. The character is armed with 4 default weapons; a knife, a pistol, a rifle and a shotgun. Other weapons that can be found are TNT and Whisky bombs. The player can shoot objects such as whisky bottles, cans and enemies to score legend points, thus filling up the "trick shot" meter that lets the character use the secondary mode of firing which varies depending on the current weapon. The combat in the game also makes use of the game's physics engine, with the player being able to trigger physics based traps such as shooting a rock and causing it to fall onto an enemy below - kills obtained this way are rewarded with extra points and a greater increase in the "trick shot" meter. Dead Man's Hand is noteworthy for featuring a protagonist of Hispanic (or Mestizo) descent.</desc>

		<name>Dino Crisis 3</name>
		<desc>Dino Crisis 3 is the third game in the Dino Crisis series, and this time, it's futuristic.

The year is 2548. The colonist spaceship Ozmandias, which disappeared over 300 years ago, suddenly reappears, with no warning or reason to it's disappearance. Attempting to contact the ship results in nothing. The Interstellar Fleet Commander sends out the Special Operations and Reconnaissance (SOAR) squadron to investigate. Their shuttle is destroyed by a merciless and unknown assailant. Everyone manages to survive, and reach the ship intact. What they encounter is something they never would've thought of.

As Patrick, the leader of SOAR, you are tasked with exploring the ship, putting the pieces together, and rescuing any survivors you can find. The ship you are on, the Ozymandias, is a dynamically changing structure, which enables you to move hallways and re-position doors so that you can access new areas all the time.</desc>

		<name>Dynasty Warriors 3</name>
		<desc>About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.

They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.

Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.

Most completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, even those that never appear in Dynasty Warriors 3.</desc>

Available weapons include a security pistol, an automatic pistol, a submachine gun, a machine gun, a shotgun, and grenades. Besides weapons, a variety of hand-to-hand moves are available, from punches, throws, and grabs to kicks and chokes.

		<desc>Fight Night is EA Sports' new boxing series, replacing the previous Knockout Kings line of games.

You have the option of creating your own personalized boxer, and entering a career mode, where you start off on the lowest rung in dirty, rundown gyms, as you make your way up the ropes to become the undisputed champion. Throughout your career you will have to battle many enemies, all vying for the same title. As you play, you will be able to train, improving your boxer's stats. You can hit a punching bag to increase power and speed, spar with an opponent for more stamina and agility, attack the dummy to improve chin and body, or hit the mitts to improve heart and cut. Besides career mode, you have access to the standard modes.

Fight Night 2004 features the "Total Control" system, which utilizes both sticks to give you complete percision over your boxer's moves. The right analog stick controls all the punching, and the left stick controls movement and defense/blocks.

There are several unlockables available, all of which must be earned through career mode. You can buy new clothes, entrance music, even new girls to accompany you to the ring.

The PlayStation 2 version of Fight Night 2004 supports online play via EA Sports' online network.

As with all other EA Sports titles, Fight Night 2004 utilizes the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your progress through all EA Sports games. The more games you play, the longer you play them, and the better you do translates into a higher Gamer Level. When you reach certain levels, you can unlock special rewards.</desc>

		<desc>In Full Spectrum Warrior, you take on the role of commander of two squads of the United States military, Alpha and Bravo, as you guide them in the fictional country of Zekistan on a mission to capture or kill the terrorist Al Afad.

 In the game, you don't directly control your troops. You don't take aim at a target and shoot, and you don't circle-strafe around enemies. Instead, you tell your squad what to do, and they'll do it. It's like a real-time strategy game. You can tell your two squads to do numerous things, such as hide behind a wall, take cover behind a car, lob a grenade, fire off a rocket, or attack a target. You will need to utilize both squads to be successful. For example, you can have Alpha squad hide behind a car and lay down covering fire at a target that you can't directly kill, giving Bravo squad cover so they may cross open terrain, and get into a position where they will be able to kill the enemy.

 The game takes place in one locations, a Middle Eastern country, that's split up into several areas. You'll have to make your way through parks, an airport, city streets, and even some buildings. Throughout the country are many terrorists, all of whom are trying to kill you. You have four members on each squad; the Team Leader, Automatic Rifleman, Grenadier and Rifleman. Each plays a unique role.

 Full Spectrum Warrior supports Xbox Live, where two players can play through the single player campaign. Instead of controlling both squads, one player controls Alpha while the other controls Bravo.</desc>

		<desc>Onimusha: Warlords, released in Japan as Onimusha (?), is the first action-adventure video game of the Onimusha series, released first for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. Later it was released in an updated form as Genma Onimusha ( ?) for the Xbox in 2002. The original Onimusha: Warlords version was also ported to Microsoft Windows, although this version was only released in Asia and Russia.

The game's plot is set in the Sengoku period and focuses on the samurai Samanosuke Akechi who fights against the forces of Nobunaga Oda. After Nobunaga's death in battle, Samanosuke goes on a quest to save Princess Yuki from demons working alongside Nobunaga's forces. The player controls Samanosuke and his partner, a female ninja Kaede, in their fight against demons.

While the game borrows elements from Capcom's own Resident Evil survival horror series, such as solving puzzles and a fixed camera, the game is focused more on the action genre with Samanosuke possessing multiple weapons that can be upgraded by defeating several enemies. Capcom originally wanted to release the game for the original PlayStation but the close release of its next generation version resulting in the project being scrapped.

Following its release, Onimusha: Warlords achieved high popularity becoming the first PlayStation 2 game to reach the one million sales. Its sales eventually surpassed the two million units worldwide. The game has been well received by video game publications and has been recognized as one of the best titles on the system. It also spanned two direct sequels for the same console and another three games within the franchise.</desc>

There are three different difficulties, or voltages, each faster than the last. There is a selection of cars to race in: British classics, 70's cop show, stock cars, GT sports, Formula X and Japanese.

Although the racing is limited to fixed lanes that you switch between there are also roadblocks, ramps, splits, loops, merges, and power-ups along the track, and you can barge other cars off.

The game has both single-player and two-player split-screen modes, and some extra game modes such as cops-n-robbers, and time trial with ghost car.</desc>

		<name>Jet Set Radio Future</name>
		<desc>A follow up to the Dreamcast title Jet Grind Radio. The setting is Tokyo in the year 2024. Freedom is a valuable commodity and freedom of expression even more so. Gangs of misbehaving teens strap on rocket-powered roller blades and skate, grind, and mark their territory with graffiti tags. Players take the role of the GGs, and can choose between any member of the gang, each with different stats, while in gang HQ. The city of Tokyo can be leisurely explored without a time limit, but the heat will be turned up when story missions are activated and the GGs find themselves being challenged by rival gangs or under attack from the cops. This time around spraying no longer requires thumbstick inputs; just roll up and start spraying away, although large tags still require more cans than smaller tags. Each section of the city has hidden objectives that are revealed by finding a hidden tape, and once completed these challenges will unlock new graffiti patterns.</desc>

		<name>Max Payne</name>
		<desc>The story is told in medias res and consists of three volumes: "The American Dream", "A Cold Day in Hell", and "A Bit Closer to Heaven". The game begins in the winter of 2001, as New York City finishes experiencing the worst blizzard in the history of the city. The intro sequence shows Max Payne, a renegade DEA agent and former NYPD officer, standing at the top of a skyscraper building as police units arrive. He then experiences a flashback from three years ago. Back in 1998, Max returned home to find that a trio of apparent junkies had broken into his house while high on a new designer drug called Valkyr. Max rushed to the aid his family, but was too late and his wife and their newborn daughter had already been brutally murdered. After his family's funeral, Payne transferred to the DEA. Three years later, Max Payne is employed as an undercover operative inside the Punchinello Mafia family responsible for the trafficking of Valkyr. His DEA colleague B.B. gives Max a message asking him to meet another DEA agent, who is also Max's best friend, Alex Balder, in the NYC Subway station. Max's arrival at the subway results in a shoot-out after he encounters mobsters working for Jack Lupino, a Mafia underboss in the Punchinello crime family, attempting a bank robbery by breaking through from the station. Working his way back to the surface, Max encounters Alex, who is then killed by an unknown assassin and Payne becomes the prime suspect in the murder. Additionally, the Mafia find out that he is a cop and now want him dead.</desc>

		<desc>NHL 2005 features Open Ice Control, which according to EA allows better control, including moving players without the puck and also a complete World Cup mode where each team can be created from scratch. For the first time, the user was allowed to import digitized home arenas for the scratchbuilt teams (the 30 NHL arenas plus Nuremberg Arena, KÃ¶lnarena, Stockholm Globe Arena, Helsinki Hartwall Areena and Prague Sazka Arena were available). Additional NHL jerseys and logos were also available including those of the defunct Atlanta Flames, Winnipeg Jets, Colorado Rockies (NHL), Quebec Nordiques as well as the old style Los Angeles Kings, Washington Capitals and Vancouver Canucks uniforms of the 1970s and the 1980s.

The IIHF license which granted the World Cup mode also allowed EA to use real-life international jerseys for the only time (previously released games used unique jerseys designed by the game's staff which only bore a passing similarity to their real life counterparts, so the jersey shows their flag.) The PC version of the game was stripped down to the bare essentials, including the omitting of the create-a-player feature. These omissions were possibly due to the labour dispute that season, but EA explained that they hadn't perfected the new create-a-player interface, which would have allowed for far greater customizability than what was previously available.</desc>

		<desc>Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors combines fantasy with real life folklore and fast paced action. It starts where its predecessor ended and this time Raikoh, the hero of the first game, is not alone. Five new warriors join him and combine their powers to tackle the task of saving the world from a new demonic threat. Gameplay is pretty much your regular hack &amp; slash, and there is lots of it. The player advances through levels, destroying huge amounts of mystical enemies with different attacks, both physical and magical,  while collecting experience which lets one improve the skills of the characters. New weapons and accessories can be purchased from a store between levels. Challenge levels separate from the main game open up as levels are completed, such as ones that task you wish surviving against a never ending horde of monsters, or destroying 100 arches in a limited time. Almost everything in the game's levels are destroyable, from trees to buildings, and the six playable characters are all different so one level might be easier to complete with one character than the other.</desc>

The heart of the game is the Coast 2 Coast mode in which you race against up to 5 AI players on 15 US themed tracks. In addition you have to impress different girlfriends. She tells you what she wants to see (a hard slide around a curve or a close take-over for example) and you have to perform it to win her heart.</desc>

		<desc>The fourth installment of the Panzer Dragoon series has you playing Orta, a young girl who has been imprisoned by the Empire. Under a wave of attack, the prison camp is broken through by a mysterious dragon, and Orta takes it upon herself to ride the dragon, and destroy the Empire once and for all. Along the way, she will also discover her own destiny, and the mystery surrounding her new friend.

Simply put, you have limited control of the dragon for most of the game, as your trigger finger will be shooting non-stop at the enemies that fly around the area. Orta will be your main source of fire-power when you simply press the fire button, but by pressing and holding, the aim cursor will change, allowing you to fire a burst of power from the dragon at whatever the cursor aims at.

The dragon itself can change into three forms at a press of a button. Each form has a different style of attack and power ability.

A port of the original Panzer Dragoon is included.</desc>

The game was originally intended to be released for the Dreamcast, but when the Dreamcast was discontinued in 2001, the game was reprogrammed for the Xbox. Following its initial release as a retail game, it was given away on a disk with Jet Set Radio Future in specially-marked Xbox console packages. Sega released Sega GT Online for the following year, with extra cars and an online facility to be used with the Xbox Live.

Sega GT 2002 introduced plenty of innovative features, many of which were later adopted by future games of its kind.

The game's cover features a Ford GT40 (called a Ford GT in the game), a Ford GT (called a Ford GT Concept in the game), and a Ford GT90.</desc>

		<desc>In Sonic Riders, Dr. Eggman challenges Sonic and his friends to a Worldwide Grand Prix, and the prize for coming out on top is an ultra-rare Chaos Emerald! Gliding on air boards â which are performance-oriented for each playable character â gamers will experience a heightened sense of sports-style racing tension as Sonic and his pals perform tricks and stunts over treacherous wide-open terrain.

Sonic and friends speed through tracks on air boards, using individual special moves to strike down opponents. Air is a big element of Sonic Riders. Your board's "fuel" source is air. You can fill up your air at various points on the course, but to race well you'll have to use another means of replenishment: performing tricks with your board. You'll also want to make use of turbulence from racers who are in front of you.</desc>

With the body count now at five, you must solve puzzles, interact with characters, and gather clues to stop the killer from striking again. You'll soon find that, oddly enough, Victoria's present case resembles the one from the past, right down to the killer's MO.</desc>

		<desc>The game of ten-pin bowling sees players attempt to knock down an arrangement of 10 pins in a triangular shape, by bowling a ball down a gutter-lined path. You have two shots, and score for how many you knock down on each bowl. As a reward for knocking down all ten pins, you will also get the score from your next bowl doubled if this took 2 shots (known as a 'spare'), or your next two bowls if it took 2 shots (known as a 'Strike').

In this implementation, you can play in one of 8 different settings, including a tropical island, ancient Egypt or on a pirate ship. There are 8 different AI players, each with varied appearance and reaction, and variable bowling ability. A range of playing modes including Tournament Play, Skins and practice are featured. Controls are designed to be easy to use, and ball reactions incorporate physics, ball friction and delivery style.</desc>

The Player is able to choose from 5 DJ poppers, including 2 unlockable ones, along with 4 grooving soundtracks. They are faced with rows of advancing bubbles of different colors. They can launch bubbles of their own. The idea is to create a row, column or stack of 3 or more bubbles. When that happens, they will pop. Each character has their own favorite bubble color and when they pop them, color energy is transferred to their special jar. Once the jar is full, the player can unleash their super special attack. During the puzzles, the player is also provided with nine different special attacks that they can obtain by getting special bubbles.</desc>

		<desc>This game is basically a fusion of Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2 for the PS2 and XBox. All of the levels from those two games are available in this collection, and all of the minigames are already unlocked and included. Formerly only available to GameCube players, the Super Monkey Ball series has made it to the PS2 and Xbox after a wait of almost 3 and a half years.

The game itself plays very much like the old arcade game Marble Madness. You control a monkey in a ball, and you have to navigate it through many perilous labyrinths to the finish. In the previous two games you had limited lives/tries, but here you have infinite lives, which makes it all the easier.</desc>

		<desc>Thrillville allows gamers of all ages to easily build and customize the coaster of your dreams. Gone are the days of the complex PC techniques used in other coaster games. Rather, Thrillville's easy to use building mode has been designed specifically for the console platforms and makes building all 75-plus rides from wooden, corkscrew and inverted coasters to merry go rounds, trains and carnival rides, easy, and most importantly, fun. Imagination is the only height limit with Thrillville, where the fun ranges from racing on go-kart tracks you put together and playing mini-golf on courses you designed to joining friends for dozens of four-player party games, from bumper cars to arcade shoot-'em-ups. You can also tour the park on foot - a first for theme-park titles - chatting and joking with all the guests to help them out and make sure they're enjoying themselves.</desc>

Old features were also kept like Create-a-park, which dates back to the Pro Skater series. Missions are still acquired by going up to random people or friends and accepting the mission they want you to run.

The game also includes a multiplayer mode and co-op for up to 2 players for added replay value.</desc>

		<desc>Total Immersion Racing is a bare-bones rendition of Gran Turismo 3 or Sega GT 2002, albeit without the preponderance of cars and special effects. What's left over is a driving simulation that offers the rich gameplay of these heavy hitters, as well as a graphical show that's nearly on par with them, but none of the frills or splash that would attract casual players in search of a vicarious speed rush. It's a game for people who want to discover what the weekly toil of GT-class competition is really like, who understand that actual racing often entails driving around the same course lap after lap without much fear of hazards or obstacles, and who don't mind that the ultimate reward is the ability to drive a handful of different cars for various teams on tracks located throughout the world.</desc>

		<desc>Totaled! is an action racing game, similar to the Destruction Derby games. Dispensing with any pretence of simulation, the game aims for arcade gameplay. The bright colours in the art style and easy way the cars can be turned with just a press of the handbrake all signal that this is not a game to be taken seriously. Although cosmetically the damage is locational, the cars do not suffer unduly if the damage is taken all in one area. Unlike the Destruction Derby games, you can continue to use your front to ram opponents throughout a match. Rather than have the cars race laps, matches more often take place in open arenas of sand, ice, grass, mud and tarmac.</desc>

		<desc>Trigger Man is an action game where the main protagonist Trigger Man works for the Coladangelo Family, who is on the brink of a mafia-style war with the rival Montagano Family, which believes Don Coladangelo is responsible of the death of their Don's son. Shown from a third-person perspective players need to visit typical locations such as villas, restaurants and casinos to take down members of the opposing family.

Next to the basic action missions there is some focus on stealth and escorting too. Some sections require a key to be found in order to progress. While fighting, there is a focus on head shots, as enemies can take a lot of bullets in other body parts before going down. There are eight missions in total.

There are different types of weapons including a blade, machine guns and sniper rifles, but only a small amount of clips can be carried. Enemies hardly ever leave anything behind, so ammo crates need to be hunted down.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls a former Marine John Dalton, a Terran Colonial Authority Marshal whose job is to patrol remote areas of space far away from any real action. He is called back into service to retrieve seven pieces of an ancient artifact thought to make a powerful weapon when assembled.

The plot follows a pre-set linear path like many first-person shooters, with the character going to various planets in search of the artifacts. Level design at each location is also linear, with a certain amount of puzzle solving and key finding.

Environments on each planet are quite diverse, ranging from tropical to desert, bunkers and industrial installations, and alien cities and even inside the bodies of aliens. During several missions the player must hold a location against waves of incoming enemies, in some cases using NPCs and equipment (such as sentry guns) as support.</desc>

		<desc>Warpath is a budget-priced first-person shooter from the same people that developed Pariah. As such, the gameplay is very similar to that game. For instance, you can heal yourself with a portable healing tool, and run at speeds so fast that they blur your vision. The main difference between the two games is that the singleplayer game is multiplayer-oriented, similar to Unreal Tournament. There is a storyline, however. You can select from one of three races fighting for the control of a beautiful, resource-rich planet named Kaladi. The Ohm are a cyborg-like race that need the planet's resources to live. The House of Kovos are robots that want to take control of Kaladi because their religion says that they should. The Human Coalition is a group of homeless humans that are trying to find a home.</desc>

Spanx has most standard platforming abilities, while Redmond is completely indestructible as a result of tests conducted upon him and so can be hurled into security guards, jammed into machinery, and used as a grappling hook, among other uses.

		<desc>A third-person action game which centers around the exploits of a crisis response team. The three player characters, Craig Contrell, Nick Bruno, and Mia Cabrera, must shoot their way through 30 missions of hostage rescuing, drug cartel smashing, and world saving in a wide variety of offices, warehouses, mansions, and laboratories. The most unique aspect of the game is its "Route" system. Each mission has two different characters, and is played through from both perspectives. During the first part each mission, a number of "Assist" points will happen where the player must assist the second character -- their performance here affects the playthrough of the second part of the mission, and doing well will reward you with cover fire or health bonuses later. There is also a multiplayer mode for up to four players, featuring several game mode including deathmatch and sniper battles. Bots are available if you have fewer than four players.</desc>

This installment includes an in-depth franchise mode that allows players to manage their coaches and minor league teams, playing it for an unlimited number of seasons.  In what has since almost become a standard for the series, Create-a-Player mode is present for players to make their own teams. Also featured are Season, Exhibition, Home Run Derby and Playoffs modes.  Little extras include saving the player's statistics to a user profile, and old-school players and uniforms. The game utilizes licenses from the MLBA, the MLB Players Choice, the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the Cooperstown Collection, and the 2002 World Series.</desc>

During tournaments, you take part in several tables en route to the final table. Each table consists of 8 players that are automatically replenished with new players when numbers dwindle. Once the tournament is down to the last 16, you move onto the "featured table", and once down to the last 8, you move onto the final table, where the winner will be decided.</desc>

		<desc>Pro Evolution Soccer 5 pushes the franchise one level up towards realism by expanding and improving character moves and control. Now, the match feels more real to the actual play as players make mistakes more often and passes don't go too well if the player is on the wrong foot, or makes a bad turn. The new gameplay may require slight adjustment for players to switch from older versions to this one. The standard modes are here, match mode (with newly added memorial match), various leagues, and cups. Some more teams now have their proper names (like "Arsenal" and "Chelsea"), and are having up to date players in the teams. Also, new weather condition has been added, snow.</desc>

		<name>World War II Combat : Iwo Jima</name>
		<desc>World War II Combat: Iwo Jima is a follow-up to World War II Combat: Road to Berlin, sporting the same gameplay mechanics and budget price tag of its predecessor. The gameplay is basically just like any other first-person shooter out there, but you can't pick up any weapons or health during a mission -- instead, your health recharges at the end of each mission and your weapons are automatically assigned for each mission. The main difference between Road to Berlin and Iwo Jima is that you're now pitted against the Japanese instead of the Germans, as the only surviving member of a squad of Marines during the American conquest of the Japanese island Iwo Jima.</desc>

		<desc>A follow-up to Combat: Task Force 121, World War II Combat: Road to Berlin shares the same basic mechanics and multiplayer functionality as its predecessor. You are Steven Moore, a young officer in the Office of Strategic Services attempting to secure research and plans for the top secret German "Vengeance Weapons" during the last days of the war.  The Russians may be allies, but they also want this research for their own purposes - you must beat them to it. The single player game takes you through aircraft fields, submarine bunkers, underground complexes and finally the remains of a war torn Berlin. As with its predecessor, the real value in this title is the multiplayer. Seven multiplayer modes, a good assortment of weapons, simple play mechanics and large maps make for a surprisingly good experience. This game also features online bots, which is a feature its predecessor lacked.</desc>

The goal of the game hasn't changed a single bit from its predecessors: the objective is still to crush, annihilate and put into oblivion the worm team of the enemy using massively-wacky weapons of destruction. About all the features of its original 2D ancestors are also present, including random wind and a fully destructible landscape. Not all the weapons that were previously available have made the cut into the 3 dimensional realm, however Worms 3D comes too with a selective set of new weaponry such as the Lottery Strike or the Gas Grenade which should allow you to find a few dozen of new ways to kill your fellow worms online.</desc>

The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, adding a more developed Story mode, in which the player cooperates with the wise Professor Worminkle, who can use a time machine to travel to different time periods such as American Old West, ancient Arabia, and Prehistoric Age. In this installment, players can customize the appearance of their worms, including helmets, glasses, facial hair, gloves, etc. A new mode called "Weapon Factory" has been added, allowing players to forge their own weapons. The game also contains a shop where players can purchase various items, using points accumulated by completing story missions or unlocking trophies. Shop items include new maps, accessories, outfits, character voices, etc.</desc>

There are ten missions per side, for a total of twenty missions. Missions range from destroying cars to picking up documents to rescuing people. The game sports a real-time damage modeling system, so cars will break apart depending on how much they are damaged.  Hoods and doors will pop loose and fly off, glass will shatter and break, license plates will get knocked loose and swing from side to side before finally falling off. The environment can be damaged as well, with street carts falling to pieces and neon signs exploding into a shower of sparks. Each side starts with a default car, but both gain access to exclusive new rides as they complete missions or by finding and touching hidden cars during levels.</desc>

It has a weak/strong grapple system. There are two types of grapples: one which is done with normal opponents and other with groggy opponents. The normal grapples do little harm when compared to grapples done when the opponent is stunned. There is a voltage meter which shows the momentum of the wrestlers. Special move, high flying attacks and taunting boost the momentum while repeated attacks cost loss in momentum. Finishers can only be applied when the opponent is stunned and the voltage meter is flashing. Excessive use of finishers also cause loss in momentum.</desc>

		<desc>After the F1 Nurburgring disaster of 2025, the Extreme Gravity Racing Association, or XGRA, was set up as a regulatory governing body for all heavy gravity race events as an equivalent of NASCAR or the FIA. The year is 2080 and a new season is about to begin. You start as a new rookie for a team and have to work your way up through leagues of increasing difficulty with various racing modes: Endurance, Peacekeeper, Speed Limited, Extreme Weather Races, Burn Off and Warmonger. Jump into your speed bike and race in more than 14 different courses, while you blast your enemies to little bits with an assortment of lasers, mines and rockets. After a few successful races, you have the opportunity to upgrade your bike and access new areas.</desc>

Beside the basic blocking system, characters have various counter-attacks available, specific to the type of attack the player is countering. In addition to standard attacks, the player can execute super attacks by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously. These include blasts or beams, some of which can stun an opponent, as well as physical attacks that have special effects. There are several different types of super attacks, each having four different levels of power.</desc>

		<desc>X-Men: Legends II - Rise of Apocalypse is an action role-playing game and a sequel to X-Men Legends. The player controls a party of four characters, though only one at a time can be controlled directly. Beside switching the characters for combat purposes, the player is often obliged to do so, because some of the tasks in the game require the specific abilities of a certain mutant. For example, Iceman can put out fire, Magneto can generate a metal bridge across a gap, etc.. Most of the time, however, is spent in combat, collecting loot and acquiring experience points. Unlike the first game, items dropped by enemies are random. The character will level up, become stronger, and learn new skills. The player can opt to allocate all the experience and skill points manually.</desc>

		<name>Xyanide</name>
		<desc>The space-witch Aguira, a young fragile girl, has turned the world of Mardar into living hell. Her sentence is death by the Maelstrom, a gigantic black hole.  But on route to the Maelstrom, the ship that carries her is hit by a meteorite full of Xyanide, which allows her to materialize her thoughts and escape.  Her first target, unsurprisingly, is Drake, her executioner who accompanies her into the Maelstrom. His ship becomes entangled into her world, and he has to fight her demons and destroy the crystals that power her devilish creations. Xyanide is essentially a 2D shooter, though technically, the graphics are three-dimensional. The player character advances automatically, the screen scrolling forward and often changing the camera view. The path is not entirely linear: at certain intersections, the player can choose where to go next. The game encompasses six large levels; regular enemies, mid-bosses, and end bosses will try to do everything in their might to foil Drake's mission.</desc>

		<desc>Players are led by a virtual personal fitness coach named Maya (voiced by Yumi Lee, who is also credited for workout design and modeling). Prior to the first workout, players must complete a fitness assessment. Players are asked to record their resting heart rates, then, following two minutes of jumping jacks, are asked to record their heart rates again. This data is used to approximate the relative intensity of the physical activity of completing that set of jumping jacks. This is then used to determine what types of exercises Maya will ask players to complete during their exercise routines. The fitness assessment also records players' self-reported weight and evaluates strength and flexibility.</desc>

		<name>187 Ride or Die</name>
		<desc>In order to become "top dog" of the game the player must race and defeat opponents through a variety of different stages all set in Los Angeles's infamous South Central region.
The game's title comes from two phrases common in the subculture. 187 is the California Penal Code section that defines murder. It has come into general use among gangs in the United States as a synonym for murder, and this usage has passed into popular culture via gangsta rap. "Ride or die" is a combination of the phrases "ride it out" and "die trying", meaning one is willing to do anything even if it involves personal risk.
If playing with another player, one can be the driver and the other can be the shooter. This can be done in the story and online mode. There are a variety of modes available to the player.</desc>

		<name>Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction</name>
		<desc>Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction is a real-time strategy game featuring three different species, all vying for control of the planet LV-742. Players can command an elite force of Colonial Marines, stalk their prey as a member of the Predator clan, or scurry along in packs as the acid-spitting Aliens. Gameplay involves advancing through a series of missions ranging in locale from jungles and caverns to futuristic battlefields and space colonies. Each faction offers ten types of combat units that can be upgraded over time with new attributes or equipment specific to the species. Predators, for instance, increase their number of vision modes, Aliens impregnate their victims with facehuggers, while Colonial Marines receive new weapon enhancements. As in titles like StarCraft, units range in scope from standard grunts and infantry to specialized forces and massive troop transports.</desc>

		<name>All-Star Baseball 2003</name>
		<desc>The All-Star Baseball baseball video game series was developed and published by Acclaim Entertainment. The series began in 1997 with the release of All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas, the successor to Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball. New York Yankees play-by-play announcers John Sterling and Michael Kay were the announcers for 1998-2000 editions of the game. The final release in the series (due to the bankruptcy of Acclaim) is All-Star Baseball 2005.

Within the individual games, there are several different modes of play, such as exhibition, managing an existing Major League Baseball team or creating a team. Many North American cities are available for "expansion," in addition to Mexico City and Puerto Rico.

Most of the games feature Derek Jeter on the cover.</desc>

		<desc>The 2004 installment in Acclaim's long-running baseball series. The game features more than 80 new features and improvements, including a deeper, more customizable franchise mode. The biggest change comes in the interface. You still hit the same buttons to swing, bunt, steal, and field, but the batting cursor has been visually altered. It's still the same triangle shape as before, just with a different outline. Bunting is more unique, though. Instead of aiming the cursor when you go to bunt, a large arrow points on the ground. Aim your bunt in the desired direction and hope for the best. Fielding has also received a slight change, with the ball cursor changing color. Four up to four players.</desc>

		<name>Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood</name>
		<desc>Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood is the second installment in the Backyard Wrestling series and was released on Xbox and PlayStation 2. The licensed soundtrack includes music by Andrew W.K., Kool Keith, the Insane Clown Posse, Bad Brains, Body Count, Six and Violence, Mudvayne, Saliva, Fall Out Boy, and Hoobastank. It was developed by Paradox Development, now owned by Midway Games, and was published by Eidos Interactive.

The television commercial included Insane Clown Posse, Vampiro, New Jack, and Major Gunns. Despite promises of an improved gameplay experience, the game was a critical flop when released in 2004. Its sales numbers remained respectable, however, moving nearly 300,000 copies through 2005.</desc>

		<name>Bad Boys Miami Takedown</name>
		<desc>This game is based on the Will Smith &amp; Martin Lawrence buddy cop movie sequel Bad Boys II. You can play as either character, Mike or Marcus, from 1st or 3rd person viewpoints. Each has their own personalities and characteristics. 

Through 15 stages, you engage in fast paced all-action gameplay that features multiple mission objectives. Shoot your way through Colombian drug lords, Russian mobsters, and even dirty cops. Sometimes you will need to protect your computer controlled partner or collect some evidence. You can often duck behind a wall or around a corner, from where you will be able to pick off your targets with less chance of being hit. You will be accordingly rewarded on your successful actions and achievements on a "Bad Boy" rating system. You can follow all the laws and avoid unneccesary damage or take the opposite approach and be a Bad Boy. There's a good amount of different weapons from pistols and shotguns to automatic assault rifles and grenades. Environments are fully destructable. You can use a quick aiming and shooting Action mode, or search for clues and evidence using the Explore mode.</desc>

Her horse serves to move her around the terrain, but she must get off to do much else. The storm also knocked some things down, so she must climb or clear obstacles to access certain areas.

When she finds a horse, she must pet it to calm it down if it's a foal, or lasso a bigger horse, then lead it to a hitching post and call the stable on her cell phone. There are also coins to find which can be used to buy new outfits for Barbie or her horse. The object of the game is to rescue all the horses and complete Barbie's wardrobe.</desc>

The Joker has died after falling from a bridge mid-scuffle with our caped hero. With the big man's place at the top of the criminal hierarchy up for grabs, the city's most heinous villains are out in force, clambering over each other for the new employment opportunity. Batman's most dangerous opponents are causing a crime wave the likes of which Gotham has never seen. Nothing is as it seems. You can't even be sure that the infamous Joker has really ceased to exist. Gotham's safety hangs in the balance and only Batman can save it.</desc>

		<name>Battlestar Galactica</name>
		<desc>Set 40 years before the Sci-Fi Channel's 2004 Battlestar Galactica miniseries, the game acts as a prequel to the events in the new series. Players control Captain William Adama as he participates in 15 missions leading up to the end of the First Cylon War.

Missions are tightly scripted. Players control three varieties of Viper fighters, as well as captured Cylon raiders, depending on the needs of the mission. Players also will man the stationary defense turrets on board the Galactica. Missions have clear goals, often with time limits, and are expressed and tracked through voiced radio chatter between wingmen and Galactica's war room. Players are graded in a variety of areas after each level (including accuracy and keeping wingmen alive), and unlock upgrades and bonus material for high ratings.

Players control their craft from either a first or third person view. Fighters have unlimited ammo, missiles, and auto-repair any damage taken, but only if enough recharging energy is available. Firing weapons and using afterburners drain energy, and the fighter only repairs itself when the energy level is full. Players must be aware of their energy usage to keep from running out at critical moments.

Missiles on every craft can also be configured on the fly through an option in the pause menu. Pilots can program missiles to have increased power at the cost of speed, or increase maneuverability at the cost of blast radius. This system allows players to adapt their missiles to the current needs of the mission, from swatting down formations of fighters to breaking through a capital ship's defenses.

Though it acts as a prequel to the new series, art and design is pulled from the original 1978 Battlestar Galactica. The intro from the original series is used. Cylons Raiders, Colonial Vipers, and the Galactica itself use the original designs, Cylons themselves look like the original chrome toasters, and the reptilian race that created them (in the original series, not the reboot) make appearances.</desc>

		<desc>Blinx 2: Masters of Time and Space is a race up against the Tom Tom Gang for the pieces of the Big Crystal. The game is different than the first as players take control of the Time Sweepers and mastering time. The Tom Tom Gang control space. However, the player does not play as Blinx. The time limit is also gone from each level. The game is more of an action game rather than a platform game. Artoon's game has expanded into non-traditional platform territories and plays more like a light-weight action game. The player has a huge arsenal of gadgets and weapons. The switch between the two teams is a new experience.</desc>

		<desc>The game begins in 1933, in a place where it appears that the people believe in vampires, as all the doors and windows show crosses. It shows a man and woman running down a street. The woman trips, and the man pauses long enough to help her up, only to be dragged into a dark alleyway by a chain. His head is thrown from an alley at the woman's feet, with Rayne walking calmly up to the woman. The woman seemingly breaks down crying, but in fact only hides her face to reveal she is in fact a vampire. After a brief fight, Rayne decapitates her and then takes off before a small army of vampires tries to catch her off guard. She drops a grenade on their position as she leaves.

On top of the buildings, two mysterious men, who were watching the events unfold the whole time, are discussing their reason for being here. One reveals they are here to recruit Rayne, who is trying to find where her father is. The other member does not want a Dhampir with the Brimstone society, regardless of the fact that she is only half-vampire and has fewer weaknesses, as the Society is trying to rid the world of Vampires (and presumably people with Vampire blood in them). Eventually they agree to recruit Rayne, and leave a necklace with their symbol on it (as seen on the game cover).</desc>

		<desc>Bloody Roar 3 is a 2000 fighting arcade video game developed by Eighting and Hudson Soft. It is the first of the series to appear on the Sony PlayStation 2.

The gameplay (the controls) had six different buttons and the commands would be; punch, kick, throw, beast form, and side-step left and right with L2 and R2, which can also be done by double tap down or up to side-step. The main feature is still the ability to transform into beasts, which is involved in all of the Bloody Roar games. Once the character transforms, they regain all the health they have lost and become much stronger and more powerful than befor</desc>

		<name>Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood</name>
		<desc>Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood is a first-person shooter video game developed by Gearbox Software and published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Xbox and PlayStation 2. The mobile phone version was developed and published by Gameloft and released in October 2005 along with the console versions. It was ported to the Wii in 2008 as a part of the Brothers in Arms: Double Time compilation.

Earned in Blood continues the Brothers In Arms saga as newly promoted Sergeant Joe "Red" Hartsock (Hartsock was the Corporal of Baker's Fire Team), who was part of the historic Normandy invasion in the previous game. Earned in Blood includes several new multiplayer missions, weapons and vehicles, plus a new co-op skirmish mode. The AI of enemies has also been improved considerably in this game, while level designs are more open-ended than the original.</desc>

		<desc>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2 is a hunting game focused on linear story-based gameplay, instead of the freeform hunting of the main Cabela's line. You will hunt 20 animals, including lions, tigers, and bears, across 12 main levels, and 4 hidden levels. There are three difficulty levels, and a slow-motion ability to help line up shots. Keep your eyes open; there are secret stumps in each level, which if shot can unlock extra levels and other items. In most levels, you will be assisted by a native guide, who will both draw the attention of the local wildlife, and assist you in killing them. The story features you, a world-famous hunter, who has just found out an old friend, Bullseye Bill, is missing. Retrace his steps around the world, helping other people along the way.</desc>

		<desc>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts is a hunting game with adrenaline - hunt or be hunted ! Many of the animals you'll be after are dangerous and aggressive and will take you one-on-one - and you'll be armed with a primary weapon as well as a knife or pistol for close combat defense. You'll hunt for 27 animals in 12 regions. Animals include dangerous species such as bears, wolves, leopards, rhinos and cape buffalo; big game species such as moose, bighorn, mountain goat, elk and caribou; and exotic species such as impala, duiker and kudu. The regions include British Columbia, Colorado, New Mexico, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Game modes include Quick Hunt (one tag, one animal, one region), Action Zone (warp from location to location, where dangerous animals are waiting to attack you), and Career Hunt (a series of missions where you have some choice as to which task you'll take on next, and unlock chartered hunts).</desc>

		<name>Carmen Sandiego: The Secret of the Stolen Drums</name>
		<desc>Cole Gannon, a rookie in the ACME detective agency finds a set of GPS coordinates on the agency's computer server, which leads him to a museum in New York. The GPS coordinates involve a case dealing with the infamous thief Carmen Sandiego, who Cole wants to capture despite being still just in training. It seems Carmen wants to put back together a set of stolen tribal drums that will unleash an unspeakable power. 

There are two other ACME operatives, Jules and Shadow, who are working on the case in Siberia at the moment so they can only help Cole with advice through email messages.

The game consists of exploring nine different locales all over the world from New York to Thailand. Each locale is broken down into several areas. Each area has different items to collect. The main items to collect are compasses. These will help in locating Carmen Sandiego's whereabouts. Another item Cole can collect are puzzle pieces. Collecting these will unlock a jigsaw puzzle for Cole to solve.

Also for Cole to make his way through areas, he has to defeat some enemy combatants who possess key codes. A few key codes are needed to unlock forcefields, which block the pathways to get further into the area. To defeat enemies, Cole is equipped with a staff he can use to whack enemies with. He also comes equipped with a dart gun, which he can use to hit switches he can't reach otherwise. Cole must also move stealthily through each area to avoid security measures and to get a drop on unsuspecting enemy units. Cole has other moves he can perform such as pole vaulting with his staff, rolling from a crouch position, pressing his body close to a wall, double jumping, tightrope walking, and hanging from ledges, pipes, and even ziplines.

During the game, players can access a menu with various tabs. The atlas tab gives educational factoids about the area Cole is in. The map tab gives detailed information about the area that Cole is currently exploring. The GPS tab gives information about where Carmen Sandiego will be heading next. The transport tab let's the player go back to the areas they previously explored in their current location. The communication tab lets the player receive messages from Jules and Shadow. .</desc>

		<desc>Cel Damage is a 2001 video game for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube. It was developed by Pseudo Interactive and published by Electronic Arts. It was released as Cel Damage Overdrive for the Sony PlayStation 2, and as of 2010 on the PlayStation Store. An HD re-release of the game, titled Cel Damage HD was released in April 2014 for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.[1]

Cel Damage is a cartoony take on vehicular combat games like Twisted Metal. The story focuses on six cartoon characters from a fictional cartoon show called "Cel Damage". The characters annihilate each other to the delight of TV audiences and, since they are cartoons, instantly regenerate. The player battles through thirteen different levels and three game modes. Weaponry for Cel Damage includes cartoon staples like vacuum nozzles and portable holes, mundane weaponry like chainsaws and baseball bats, and items like freeze rays, giant springs, and portable nuclear devices.</desc>

You can play training games (with all the hints and analysis tools available), rated games (your rating changes after each play), puzzles (chess ones, not the "build the picture" type), learn chess by browsing through the hundreds of tutorials available in the Pandolfini's Chess School or watch famous games.

There are, however, some new features in the PS2 version; the most useful one is the Online mode. Other is the "living world" of the Chessmaster Championships, where the AI's rating changes, too, as they play each other. The last one is more spectacular - a fantasy-themed - orcs vs. humans - game mode with animated chess sets and a 3D environment. You get to play chess in a forest, inside a castle and in the desert.</desc>

		<desc>In Cold War you play the role of Matthew Carter, an American journalist, who gets into serious trouble when chasing after a story in of Russia in 1986. You soon realize that you have been led you into a trap orchestrated by anti-perestroika KGB conspirators, headed by a fictional KGB director Named Georgi Barinski. These conspirators want to stop you from uncovering their plans, and also get revenge for a previous news story in which you exposed a KGB operation in Berlin. To get you out of the way, they have switched your ordinary camera for one incorporating a cunning X-ray weapon, and have framed you as a CIA assassin who wanted to kill General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev (who, in the game, is somewhat incorrectly referred to as the "president" -- even though no such office existed at the time). Your goal is to escape the Lubyanka KGB prison, together with the head of the Presidential Guard, a loyalist named Grushkov who has also been framed. You must work with him to stop the KGB radicals from overthrowing the government, and to prove that you are both innocent.

Cold War's gameplay is based on stealth, similar to games like Splinter Cell or Dark Project. Being a journalist you are no weapons expert, so you should try to be stealthy and attack only when necessary. To help even the odds, you can create useful gadgets out of items you find, improvising things like gas grenades, anesthesia ammunition or distraction items.</desc>

The games are almost identical except for a few differences: the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions has the ability to create their own chants for their crowds to yell during home games and the PS3 utilizes the SIXAXIS controller to shoot free throws by tilting it.</desc>

		<name>Combat Elite : WWII Paratroopers</name>
		<desc>Combat Elite: WWII Paratroopers is primarily a top-down close-combat shooter with some RPG features. It can be played in single-player or two-player coop mode. The game lets the player take part as a paratrooper in the allied campaign in Europe during the second world war, starting out as a private soldier from either the US 101st Airborne, the US 82nd Airborne, or the British 1st Airborne regiment. There are 40 missions strung together with a narrative, depicting the Operation Overlord (D-Day), Bastogne, Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge and beyond - ending in an fictional effort to stop the Nazis from creating an atomic bomb. During a mission, you find medical packs, ammunition (weapon specific), and new weapons as pickups lying around, or dropped by enemies killed - the drops disappear if not picked up in time. A mission takes place on a series of relatively small maps, separated into 'levels', and at the level transition points the player can save the game, and is also awarded skill points, new ranks and medals.</desc>

		<name>Conflict: Vietnam</name>
		<desc>Conflict: Vietnam is the third game in Pivotal Games' Conflict Series this time taking you further back in time to the bloody battleground of Vietnam. The game is set during the Tet offensive in the year 1968.

You take over the role of four soldiers who aren't, contrary to previous games, elite S.A.S / Delta Force soldiers. In fact, they are normal American G.I. who are separated from their unit during battle and have to fight themselves through enemy territory with hordes of hostile Vietnamese.

You can issue orders to every member of your squad or directly take control over one of them. In every mission you have one or more main and several bonus aims like destroying all tanks in the area or collecting Vietcong documents. For each achieved objective, killed soldier or destroyed vehicle your soldiers get experience points. Each soldier has different abilities (Sniper, Leader, Heavy Weapons, Medic) which can be improved with these points. To defuse one of the numerous booby traps it is necessary to have skills in that ability.

The levels are set around the jungle and include underground Vietcong complexes or temples. You don't only meet enemies but also friendly persons like own soldiers or citizens with which you can talk and which sometimes give you bonus objectives. Furthermore, in some missions you can use stationary weapons like machine guns and drive jeeps or tanks.

The console versions of Conflict: Vietnam feature a split-screen multiplayer co-op mode with up to four players (Xbox) resp. two players (PS2). The PC version doesn't have this feature.</desc>

		<name>Constantine</name>
		<desc>John Constantine is the name of the main character in the Hellblazer comic by Vertigo DC. This game is based on the movie Constantine, starring Keanu Reeves. The player assumes the role of Constantine, a mage/exorcist/demonslayer of the modern age. A man who fights Evil, but remains cynical and skeptical in the face of Good. He also smokes a lot.

The game is played in third person perspective, switching to first person when the hero enters narrow spaces. Constantine's goal is to discover how and why Demons have managed to physically enter Earth, although the ancient laws forbid it. He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch's Curse) that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell, which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or stretched out to allow for more action. Hidden cards in levels will unlock cutscene animatics, concept art, and interviews with the stars of the film.</desc>

		<desc>Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge is a first-party video game developed by FASA Studio (part of Microsoft Game Studios) for the Xbox. The game, like the earlier Crimson Skies for the PC, is an action-oriented arcade flight game. Nonetheless, there are significant differences between the gameplay of High Road to Revenge and that of the original PC title. For example, while the Xbox game has a more open-ended mission structure, it offers less plane customization than the PC game.

Set in an alternate 1930s in which the plane and Zeppelin become the primary means of transportation, the game focuses on the adventures of Nathan Zachary, leader of the Fortune Hunters air pirate gang. Players assume his role as he undertakes a crusade to avenge the death of his old friend, "Doc" Fassenbiender.</desc>

During the thirteen linear levels, the player takes control over George. The majority of time is spent with platform challenges which usually involve jumping or swinging over gaps. Frequently the levels are interrupted by mini games, Those involve simple tasks, for example rhythm sequences (pressing given buttons with the correct timing) or arcade sequences. Optionally the player can collect bananas on the way and receive special points by interacting with certain objects. Those are used to unlock bonus content: the cutscenes and mini games already experienced during regular play as well as a few hats for George to wear.</desc>

		<desc>Centuries ago two unspeakably evil forces were entrapped in a Demon Stone while battling each other. Now three adventurers happen to meet by chance and discover the Demon Stone just as it breaks and releases the two spirits: a Githyanki general and a Slaad lord. Now only these three can prevent a war that will sweep over all Faerun. Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone is an action RPG set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Forgotten Realms. Take control of three heroes, Rannek the fighter, Illius the sorcerer, and Zhai the rogue, as they try to destroy the evil unleashed by the breaking of the Demon Stone. The player only controls one character at a time but can switch between them on the fly with the direction pad. Each character has his/her own attack and can perform combos by pressing certain button combinations, e.g. B + B or A + B + A, and even perform team attacks and a team super attack. As they gain experience they will gain levels and can purchase new moves (combos) or upgrade old ones with experience points. They also collect gold with which they purchase new weapons, armor, and accessories at the end of each chapter.</desc>

		<desc>The game is set in the Digimon Data Squad universe, and revolves around the Seven Great Demon Lords. In this game the player will be able to control the four main Savers characters, Marcus Damon, Thomas H. Norstein, Yoshino "Yoshi" Fujieda, and Keenan Crier along with their respective Digimon partners. The graphics for this game are cel-shaded and the battle system is similar to the Battle Terminal (a Japanese-only arcade game). The game is classified as a "special genre", called a "Dramatic/Innovative RPG", which means that the Digimon partners are affected by how you, the player, treat them. The way your Digimon evolves will be similar to Digimon World; the Digimon will be affected by how you take care of it and, depending on that, will digivolve into different types of Digimon. In Digimon World Data Squad, a new type of digivolution method is used, called the Galactica Evolution System: this will determine what Digimon your partner will evolve into. There will also be new, original characters for this game, meaning that these characters are exclusive to Digimon World Data Squad, and will not appear in any other Digimon Data Squad media.</desc>

		<name>Doom 3</name>
		<desc>Doom 3 (stylized as D00M3) is a science fiction survival horror first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Activision. Doom 3 was first released for Microsoft Windows on August 3, 2004.[6] The game was later adapted for Linux, as well as being ported by Aspyr Media for Mac OS X. Developer Vicarious Visions ported the game to the Xbox console (now backwards compatible to the Xbox 360), releasing it on April 3, 2005. British developers Splash Damage also assisted in design for the multiplayer elements of the game.[7]

The game is a reboot of the Doom franchise, disregarding storylines of the previous Doom video games, it is however a prequel to Doom I and II (according to the Doom RPG website they are all part of the same universe, it places Doom RPG as a sequel to Doom 3, and prequel to Doom/Doom II all starring the same marine character[8]). Doom 3 is set in 2145 on Mars, where a military-industrial conglomerate has set up a scientific research facility to research into fields such as teleportation, biological research and advanced weapons design. However, the teleportation experiments inadvertently open a gateway to Hell, resulting in a catastrophic invasion by demons. The player, an anonymous space marine, must fight through the base and find a way to stop the demons attacking Earth.[9] Doom 3 features an award-winning game engine, id Tech 4, which has since been licensed out to other developers,[10] and later released under the GNU General Public License in November 2011.

The game was a critical and commercial success for id Software; with more than 3.5 million copies of the game sold, it is the most successful game by the developer to date.[10][11] Critics praised the game's graphics and presentation,[12] although reviewers were divided by how close the gameplay was to that of the original Doom, focusing primarily on simply fighting through large numbers of enemy characters.[13] The game was followed by Resurrection of Evil, an expansion pack developed by Nerve Software in April 2005, while a Doom film loosely based on the series was released in October 2005. A series of novelizations of Doom 3, written by Matthew J. Costello, debuted in February 2008.[14] An expanded and improved BFG Edition was released in the fourth quarter of 201</desc>

		<name>Dreamfall: The Longest Journey</name>
		<desc>Dreamfall: The Longest Journey (Norwegian: DrÃ¸mmefall: Den lengste reisen) is an adventure video game developed by Funcom for Microsoft Windows and Xbox platforms on April 2006. On 1 March 2007, a sequel entitled Dreamfall Chapters: The Longest Journey was announced,[1] and Funcom reportedly considered the idea of a massively multiplayer online game set in the The Longest Journey universe.[2]

The game is the sequel to Funcom's The Longest Journey, released in 1999, and takes place ten years after the events of the first game. The story focuses on three characters, ZoÃ« Castillo, April Ryan, and Kian Alvane, who live in two parallel worlds: technologically advanced Stark and magical Arcadia. April was the protagonist of the first game, while the other two are new characters. The main storyline follows ZoÃ«, a Stark resident whose investigation of her ex-boyfriend's disappearance and other mysterious occurrences lead her to April. Meanwhile in Arcadia, April battles the villainous Empire of Azadi while Kian, an elite Azadi soldier, is sent to assassinate her. The game features returning characters from its predecessor, such as Brian Westhouse and Gordon Halloway, but playing The Longest Journey is not a prerequisite to understanding its plot.</desc>

		<name>Dynasty Warriors 4</name>
		<desc>Dynasty Warriors 4 (??????3 Shin Sangokumus? 3?, Shin Sangokumusou 3 in Japan) is a hack and slash video game and the fourth installment in the popular Dynasty Warriors series. Dynasty Warriors 4 was developed by Omega Force and published by Koei. The game is available on PlayStation 2 (PS2) and Xbox and is based on a series of books called Romance of the Three Kingdoms, written by Luo Guanzhong. As the series has progressed, it has strayed further from the actual plot of Romance of the Three Kingdoms but instead has given the user more input on how the storyline progresses. When it was released in Japan as Shin Sangokumusou 3, it topped the sales charts, sold over one million copies within nine days,[2] and received an average of 78 out of 100 on Metacritics reviews.[3]

Originally released on the PS2 in March 2003, it was later ported to the Xbox in September of the same year and, in 2005, ported to the PC under the name Dynasty Warriors 4 Hyper. Two expansions were released for the PS2 version of the game, Xtreme Legends and Empires. Whereas Xtreme Legends requires the player to use the original Dynasty Warriors 4 disc to access all of its features, Empires is a stand-alone game and can be played with all of its content without the use of the original disk. The game is the first in the Dynasty Warriors series to introduce an Empires expansion pack and the second to include an Xtreme Legends title. These expansions are not available for the Xbox version of the game.</desc>

		<name>Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness</name>
		<desc>Egg Mania is a puzzle game in which the player controls an egg shaped character against either a computer opponent or another player via the link cable. The object of the main modes is to build a tower tall enough to reach a balloon at the top of the play field before the opponent does. If the player tries to take a short cut and not build complete floors, the structure will start crumbling and the water will come up faster. There are plenty of obstacles, both from the game and from competing opponents. Falling meteors can knock the player down into the water, while bombs thrown by the opponent will destroy parts of the player's structure. The main modes include Over Easy and Hard Boiled, the difference being that in the latter a different difficulty can be chosen.

There are four extra modes: Survival, Solo, Time Trial and Bomb. In Survival the player must survive as many rounds as possible, while the goal in Solo is to increase the overall score by completing rows and performing combos; Time Trial challenges the player to continually beat his or her own best time; finally, in Bomb, whoever destroys the opponent's tower first wins.

Compared to the GBA version, the console versions have improved graphics and sound, cutscenes at the beginning of each level, a play area that is wider by one block, two additional modes (8-player Tournament and Custom, where the rules can be customized by activating different options), but lacks the Time Trial mode. Otherwise they are completely identical, both in gameplay and level design.</desc>

		<desc>ESPN NFL Primetime 2002 is the first football game to combine the NFL license with the ESPN license. This NFL adaptation boasts a comprehensive franchise mode that introduces some innovations in this standard mode. One of these is a draft ticker, which puts your team on the clock each time it selects a player in the draft. With the draft ticker on, it is important to scout college players beforehand and analyze draft positions and team needs in order to preselect your team's draft candidates. In simulated games, NFL Primetime gives a variety of coach options. Here you can customize your team's aggressiveness level in offense and blitz tendencies and even set spies on more mobile quarterbacks for simulated games. Naturally, there are also obvious franchise mode options such as the ability to draft, trade, and sign/release free agents over multiple seasons.</desc>

		<name>Family Guy Video Game!</name>
		<desc>The Griffin family from Fox's animated TV series makes its way to video gaming for the first time.

In this action-adventure, which runs like an episode from the show, players control Peter, Brian and Stewie through various goals and adventures.

After being hit on the head by a satellite dish, Peter wakes up in a hospital believing that Mr. Belvedere (from the 1980's sitcom) has kidnapped his family, and everyone in town is an accomplice. Peter makes his way through town beating up anyone who gets in his path, in a side-scrolling beat-em-up fighting mode.

Brian is falsely accused of impregnating Carter Pewterschmidt's prized racing dog Seabreeze. Brian must escape the police station without being seen and collect evidence proving that he is not the father. Brian's game mode relies heavily on stealth/espionage gameplay.

Stewie's battle against his half-brother Bertram continues as Stewie must destroy everything in his path to infiltrate a hospital and the inside of Peter in order to find Bertram's lair and stop him from taking over the world. Stewie's adventure takes place as a platformer action game with shooting elements.

Much like the show, there are segues which translate into mini-games that will yield power-ups for each mission if completed successfully.</desc>

		<desc>FIFA 07 (also known as FIFA Football 07 and FIFA 07 Soccer) is the 2006 edition of EA Sports' series of football simulator video games. Developed by EA Canada, it is published by Electronic Arts.

It was the last game in the FIFA series to be released for the GameCube, Xbox, and Game Boy Advance, and the first to be released for the Xbox 360. The next-generation graphics and physics engine used in the Xbox 360 version will be exclusive to the console for a period of 12 months.[4] It was also released for PC, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation 2.

There are seven different covers of FIFA 07, each with a different player, depending on which region the game is sold in. Ronaldinho (FC Barcelona) graced the cover of all the games and was joined by Landon Donovan (Los Angeles Galaxy) and Francisco Fonseca (UANL Tigres) in North America; Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Benelux; Lukas Podolski (Bayern Munich) in Germany; David Villa (Valencia) in Spain; KakÃ¡ (Milan) in Italy; Juninho (Lyon) in France; Tranquillo Barnetta (Bayer Leverkusen) in Switzerland; and Kim Nam-Il (Suwon Samsung Bluewings) in South Korea.

		<desc>FIFA Football 2004, also known as FIFA Soccer 2004 in North America, is a football video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts. It was released in October 2003 with the tagline "Create Brilliance".

FIFA Football 2004 is the eleventh game in the FIFA series and the eighth to be in 3D. While not adding much to the engine used in FIFA Football 2003, the biggest new inclusions were secondary divisions, which allow the player to take lower ranked teams to promotion attempts. Gameplay has a new feature dubbed "Off the ball", which allows the control of two players at the same time for greater tactical play. Another key feature was Football Fusion, which allows owners of both FIFA 2004 and Total Club Manager 2004 to play games from the management sim in FIFA. The title sequence was filmed in St James' Park, home of Newcastle United, with the opening song being Kings of Leon's European hit "Red Morning Light".

The cover features Alessandro Del Piero of Juventus, Thierry Henry of Arsenal, and Ronaldinho in a Brazil kit.</desc>

		<desc>2002 FIFA World Cup, sometimes known as FIFA World Cup 2002, is the official World Cup video game published by EA Sports.



An amalgamation between the game engines of FIFA Football 2002 and FIFA Football 2003, the game still incorporates the power bar for shots and crosses but with a steeper learning curve and customisation of the chances of being penalised by the match referee. Some kits are licensed, along with player likeness and the stadia of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Unlike the previous games in the FIFA series, the game had an original soundtrack performed by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. It was released for Windows, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox.</desc>

		<desc>Fight Club is based on David Fincher's film adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. Fed up with consumerist American culture, a fight club is founded as a new type of therapy through bare-knuckle fighting. The game focuses on the fights and uses many characters and environments from the original story. You can create a new fighter or clone one of the generated characters. There are three general fighting styles to choose from: grappling, kung fu or brawling. The moves range from basic punches to devastating moves with broken bones, ripped clothes and real-time facial deformation. After each successful fight, you earn Character Development Points (CDP's) which can be used to upgrade or heal your character.</desc>

		<desc>EA Sports' Fight Night Round 3 from EA Chicago lets you make your own fighter, train them up, and literally take on the world.

Start by creating your own champ and customizing how they look, what equipment they have, their fighting style, their weight class, their signature move, and even their own illegal hit. Get equipment and trainers for your fighter to enhance his look and performance.

Then take your fighter to career mode where you'll play fight your way up from the local gym all the way up to five-star venues. Get trainers to enhance your training and boost your speed and power. Play against randomly generated fighters all the way up through the ranks till you beat them in points or to a pulp. Certain fights may get you a bit of extra money as an incentive, or give you a promotional deal, but pick your fights carefully because strategy inside the ring won't matter if you mismanage your fisher outside.

Fight smart during the fight by using the total punch control system to throw the punches you want to by using the analog stick. The total punch control system maps your fists to the analog stick getting rid of the need for senseless button mashing.</desc>

		<desc>Furious Karting is a kart racing game. Choosing from one of two racer clans, players race across tracks ranging from seedy slums to shopping malls. While the game in itself plays very much like a whimsical and cartoony kart racer, it includes several elements not seen in other kart racing games, such as the usage of a aluminum bat to knock off enemies, which impacts your karma meter and is used in how other racers will treat you in future races, this can be countered with apologizing. There's also a trick system, if used correctly, can give you a temporary speed boost. Typical kart racing powerups such as speed boosts and rockets can be used to stall or slow down other racers. 

There are two multiplayer modes that can be played up to 4 players on the Xbox system, such as the "classic" mode, which is the base single player game and "Jam" mode, where players must acquire a CD and hold onto it for a limited time to be declared the winner.</desc>

		<desc>Captain Rhama Sabrier is invited by the old healer Areliano to investigate the appearance of a mysterious ship below the island. Rhama finds out that the ship was used to transport rare healing herbs and contains the clues for finding them and bringing them to the healer. But at this point everything goes wrong. Rhama and Areliano are betrayed, and soon the Captain finds himself on the run; but that doesn't mean that he abandons the quest. Aided by Faith, Areliano's lovely daughter, and other friends he meets on his journey, Rhama is determined to bring the betrayer to justice and deliver the ship's legacy to the right hands.

Galleon is a 3D action game with platforming elements, created by the designers of the original Tomb Raider. Like in most other games of this kind, most of the gameplay is dedicated to jumping and climbing, with some combat thrown in. However, Galleon includes many less typical elements. Rhama possesses extraordinary acrobatic skills and can run on walls and perform very long jumps. The game has an unusual control scheme, which makes Rhama respond to the amount of pressure the player applies to the analog stick, allowing various and precise combinations of running and jumping, including the possibility to influence character movement during free fall. 

Further stand-out features include cooperation between characters (similarly to ICO, though Rhama has two female companions), treasure hunt system (Rhama can use his pirate senses to discover hidden treasures), and boss battles that require climbing on the enemies to destroy them, Shadow of the Colossus-style.</desc>

		<desc>A long war has ended and the Galactic Empire has grown but it isn't stable. Rebel groups still fight the regime but with the invention of genetic transformation, a normal civilian can be transformed into a mindless, easy to command but strong fighting unit. These civilians weren't asked, they were forced to undergo the procedure. You play one of these civilians. First they took your daughter and then they came for you. But before the procedure was completed, you were rescued by the rebels. Now it's your turn to fight back.

Gene Troopers is basically a shooter but it lets you build and upgrade your weapons with stuff you find lying around. You can also extract the genes of an enemy to upgrade your own. With these codes you can choose in which direction you want to go with your character. This means you can either choose to upgrade your stealth abilities or to devote them to becoming a fighter.

The game takes you to 6 different planets including a jungle world. There are drivable vehicles and team members to help you with your task.</desc>

The game is set in North Korea, where an evil general is diverting all the humanitarian aid to boost his forces and gain more political power in the process and it's up to Ghosts to eliminate this threat.

There is a single player campaign mode, where the player as part of the Ghosts, must take on the evil general in 11 different and quite long missions. There is also a multiplayer modes in both on and offline. The main campaign can be played through with a friend, or you can fight other players in multiple game modes spanning from a simple deathmatch to team based modes.

New to this part of the series is the possibility to use a third person viewpoint, but the classic "From the eyes"-view is also available.</desc>

As in previous Ghost Recon games, players command their team of Ghosts while neutralizing hostile forces and completing various mission objectives. These objectives can range from escorting friendly units across the map to rescuing hostages or taking out enemy artillery.

Being a tactical shooter, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter places emphasis on using cover effectively in order to stay alive, together with sound strategic co-ordination to successfully complete mission objectives. A new feature is the Integrated Warfighter System, a system based upon the Future Force Warrior program.

		<name>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Island Thunder</name>
		<desc>In 2010, two years after the events of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, and one year after the events of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Desert Siege, Cuba is free, or at least it's supposed to be. Since Fidel Castro's death [in the storyline] in 2006, the island of Cuba is wary of the communist rule it had been under for nearly 50 years. It's time for the first free and open elections since Carlos Prio Socarras, who was overthrown by Batista in the early 1950s. The FDG (El Frente Democratico de la Gente or People's Democratic Front) has fronted a man named Ariel Priego as their candidate. The FDG are an outspoken anti-American political faction that wishes to return Cuba to its long-standing communist dictatorship. Although the FDG publicly denies utilizing violence as a means of coercion, the reality is quite the contrary, as the Ghosts quickly discover. Now it is up to them to set things right again, without making it appear that the United States is getting its hands too dirty, and ensuring the elections proceed smoothly.

The first few missions see the Ghosts conducting operations against arms and drug shipping operations by agents and allies of Priego, the ultimate aim being to prevent any strong-arming of voters on election day. When election day comes, the Ghosts are responsible for protecting a voting center in Havana, a task that proves none too easy as men loyal to Priego assault the building and take hostages elsewhere in the city. Unsurprisingly, Priego loses the election badly. Becoming desperate, he asks for help from his backers in Colombia, and FARC sends in hired soldiers to take Cuba by force. The Ghosts assist in defeating this effort, and FARC soon decides to cut its losses.

Running out of allies, time, and options, Priego flees to an old fortress in a hilled section of Cuba. The Ghosts are ordered to assault the fortress and capture Priego alive. If he is killed, he could be made into a martyr all too easily, something that would be highly detrimental to the new Cuban government. The Ghosts succeed, destroying a helicopter that Priego had intended to use for his escape. Trapped and with his remaining soldiers killed, Priego surrenders.</desc>

		<name>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</name>
		<desc>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a 2005 video game based on the film Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The movie is based on J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series.

The game follows the three main characters of the film â namely Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley â and there is an entirely new spell-casting system that allows for collaborative spells. The characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. It also has higher-quality graphics than the previous Harry Potter video games. However, the game play in the fourth video game is much more action-oriented, which is a change from the previous games.

In addition, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using Accio and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character, cards.

There is no RPG iteration of the game, unlike with previous titles. In addition, it was pointed out that unlike the previous installments, there was not much room to "run around" such as in the previous games where you were allowed to move freely within the castle and on the grounds.

The game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it.

It is noted as the last Harry Potter game released on GameCube and Xbox, it is also the first Harry Potter Game to get an E10+ Rating in North America.</desc>

		<name>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</name>
		<desc>Two years after versions on other platforms, the then-current consoles got their own adaptation of the first Harry Potter book and film. Like in the computer and PlayStation versions, Harry Potter's first year at school of magic Hogwarts is presented as a 3D action adventure title.

After a tutorial at Ollivander's Wand Shop and an introductory first night at Hogwarts, the game is organized into distinct days and nights. Days mostly consist of lessons, where usually Harry will learn new spells. The more interesting stuff happens at night, of course, when Harry sneaks around the castle to do things like meeting Draco Malfoy for a duel, fighting a troll in the dungeons, and other important scenes from the film and book.

Most tasks involve platform sections, where Harry has to jump over chasms and balance along edges. Often, creatures will be in the way that have to be fought using the correct spells, and magic must also be used to solve the occasional puzzle. At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There's also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin.

After classes, Hogwarts can be freely explored. At any time, it is possible to revisit school lessons to get better grades, often only possible after some more advanced spells have been learned. Also, lots of collectibles can be found both in the open and hidden areas: collecting 20 wizard cards increases Harry's health and Every Flavour Beans can be traded in Fred and George's shop for more cards and some other useful items.</desc>

		<name>I-Ninja</name>
		<desc>I-Ninja is a 3D platform title starring an original character created by British developer Argonaut Software. Players control a spirited young ninja as they make their way through a diverse selection of indoor and outdoor locales. The title character is garbed in a blue suit and matching hooded mask, so that only his eyes and his expressive brow are visible to players. The character also wields a pair of katana blades in both hands as he jumps from platform to platform, avoiding hazards and slicing at enemies. The cartoon-style atmosphere is brought to life with the use of cel-shaded graphics, giving the game a distinctive look from many of its platform contemporaries.

I-Ninja is an adrenaline-charged adventure game. An ultra-cool ninja with major attitude meets extreme sports game play, I-Ninja is the consummate warrior who has spent years mastering his weapons and honing his skills. In true gravity defying game play, I-Ninja can scale buildings, "shred" on extreme rails, hover great distances with a "sword copter", ride drifting roller spheres and utilize specialized manga-style ninja moves to navigate through each dynamic environment.</desc>

		<desc>Ice Age 2: The Meltdown is loosely based on the movie of the same name. The game takes place in prehistory - you play as Scrat, the hapless (but not totally helpless!) proto-squirrel, helping your friends escape the coming of a huge flood. The WASD keys move you forward and back, left and right, and the mouse controls camera movement and some actions. Scrat has a few special moves as well, such as sniff, his spin attack, a double jump, a ground stomp (useful for breaking ice), and a roll attack. Much of the game consists of hunting down acorns and other special nuts for health renewal or for unlocking bonuses. There are a few mini-games within the game - you can play as Sid, zipping along an ice slide while avoiding obstacles; there's also penguin-bowling and a mini-game where you "shoot" at monkeys to regain a walnut that was whisked out from under your nose.</desc>

The graphics have also been improved, along with a new physics model.

Included is an arcade mode, in both singleplayer and multiplayer, as well as a new simulation mode. In the simulation mode, there is a series of racing tests/tutorials to teach the basics, then purchasing and customizing a car, then going drag racing. The game contains 24 official drivers and 11 official tracks. There are 35 vehicles and 70 vehicle components to customize, from tires to transmissions to electronics.

The game features the official endorsement of the International Hot Rod Association.</desc>

A good deal of publicity was generated from the developer's rejection of conventional game genre labeling for the title; Quantic Dream prefers to brand it as the first truly "interactive film" rather than an adventure or third-person action title. This game features a large amount of motion captured animation as well as branching story lines, split screen cameras and an interface designed to be intuitive and realistic. Event triggers in the game are also mainly time-based, as opposed to the more common player-initiated progression found in most games.</desc>

		<desc>You are Rico Rodriguez, a CIA-agent who is sent to the small Island of San Esperito to start a revolution and bring down the current regime under the rule of General Salvador Mendoza.

After you jumped out of the airplane and helped your local contact survive an attack by gang members, you have - much like GTA: San Andreas - the freedom to do what you want. The complete island is accessible from the beginning and you can either follow the main storyline, engage in side-missions, or collect items all over the place. To help the revolution you can also drive the government out of the individual sectors on the island. This is accomplished by a three-stages fight in which you have to go up against a huge army of government forces.

As a fully trained agent, Rico can also perform many stunts. He has always an parachute equipped which he can open whenever he has enough speed. So he often uses cars or bikes as a jump-pad and then sails smoothly into the sunset.

But of course he cannot impress the evil regime with that, so he also has access to a wide range of weapons from pistols with unlimited ammo to rocket launchers and machine guns. Rico is also trained to drive everything that has an engine, from a normal bike to a fully-armed military helicopter.</desc>

A team of super powered criminals, having never worked together before, seize a Nevada missile base. And deep beneath the surface of Mars, dozens of alien warriors are released from their long imprisonmentâ¦

These seemingly unrelated events prove to be pieces of a sinister plan, and it will take Earthâs greatest superheroes to stop it: The Justice League!

Justice League Heroes is an action game, also for two players cooperatively, based on the popular DC Comics series. Control DCâs most popular heroes: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, The Flash, Zatanna and a handful of unlockable characters like Aquaman, Green Arrow, Hawkgirl, Huntress, Hal Jordan, and Kyle Rayner. In addition, the PSP version features exclusive unlockable heroes: Supergirl and Black Canary.

Players battle through famous locations such as Metropolis, S.T.A.R. labs, and for the first time, the Justice League's Watchtower.

Many of DCâs greatest villains face against our heroes including Braniac, Killer Frost, Darkseid, and Doomsday. Boss battles are furious and unique, with no two defeated the same way.</desc>

		<desc>The game is a remotely controlled super-soldier, Nick Bishop. For most of the game the soldier is remotely controlled by a man known only as "Controller." Controller is apparently using a direct neural connection to Bishop. Bishop's suppressed memories occasionally break through, causing Controller headaches. The memories feature a woman and the phrase, "Say my name." Controller, under orders from a man named Archer, uses Bishop in a series of combat missions designed to convince two nations or groups known as the North and the West to go to war. Archer plans on war profiteering in the resulting war, in part by selling copies of the technology that controls Bishop. Moments before Bishop launches a warhead equipped with a biological agent, a woman known as "Duchess" takes over Bishop, in the process causing a surge that kills Controller. Duchess uses Bishop to attack the base Controller is operating from and eventually restore Bishop's memories. It is revealed that the woman from Bishop's memories was his new wife. She was killed by Archer when Archer captured Bishop. Archer wanted the technology in Bishop for resale. Freed, Bishop makes a final assault on Archer. Afterwards, Archer is killed and Bishop walks away.</desc>

		<desc>KOF 2002 discards the 4-on-4 "Striker Match" format used in the previous three games in the series and returns to the 3-on-3 Battle format originally used in the series up until KOF '98.
The game also revamps the Power Gauge system into a format similar to the one used in KOF '98. Like previous games in the series, the Power Gauge is filled as the player attacks the opponent or performs Special Moves during battle. The number of Power Gauges the player can stock up increases by one with each member of the team, with the first member of the team being able to stock up to three Power Gauges, while the third member can stock up to five. A single Power Gauge stock can be used to perform a Counterattack and Evasion technique while guarding an opponent's attack, use a Super Special Move, or initiate the MAX Activation state.
During MAX Activation, the player's offensive and defensive strength is increased for a short period and can cancel any attack into another. In this state, a Super Special Move can be used without consuming a Power Gauge stock. There are also MAX Super Special Moves, which are Super moves that can only be performed during MAX Activation with one Power Gauge stock, and MAX2 moves that require two stocks.</desc>

		<desc>In Madden NFL 2005, EA Sports ran a campaign with the Theme "Fear the D" emphasising their improvements on the "other side of the ball." In an attempt to re-balance the players experience, EA gave a Playmaker Tool to the defense. Similar to the offensive Playmaker Tool, the defensive Playmaker allows the player to make pre-snap defensive adjustments. EA Sports further utilized the right analog joystick on defense by creating the "Hit Stick", an option on defense that allows the controlled player to make big hits, with a simple flick, that increases the chances the ball carrier will fumble. Also introduced for the first time is the "Formation Shift." This new feature allowed players to shift their formation in the pre-snap audible menu without actually changing the play.</desc>

		<name>Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure</name>
		<desc>Contents Under Pressure is an action adventure that combines stealth and combat, as you guide urban graffiti artist Trane to fame. In the oppressed city of New Radius, you need to establish your name as an artist by laying down tags, burners and full pieces, but rival crews and law enforcement (Civil Conduct Keepers) are always on your tail. You will also uncover a conspiracy that plagues the city.

The game is story-driven with linear level progression. Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces. As it is not a friendly environment, Trane can deliver a host of punch and kick combos, use grabs, humiliate other artists, and interact with the surroundings. Your art arsenal includes markers, brushes, cans and rollers. All available pieces are kept in your black book, and new styles are unlocked while playing.

The title refers to working your way up the scene, as well as the "Get In, Get Up, and Get Out" principle - you need to gain access to restricted areas, get up on tall objects where your work can be seen, and get out afterwards without being caught. Good spots can be tracked using Intuition, and appear as coloured clouds.

The game is conceived by clothing impresario Marc Ecko, founder of the suburban designer label Ecko and is intended to pay tribute to graffiti culture and its history. Artists such as Cope2, Futura and Seen contributed art to the game.</desc>

		<name>Medal of Honor: Frontline</name>
		<desc>Frontline is a first-person shooter where players take control of the protagonist player character in a first-person perspective where they fight through levels set during the Second World War against the Wehrmacht using historical weaponry of the era, performing a series of military operations. Briefings take place at the start of each mission, which advance the plot and introduce new characters. Each mission is structured through a number of linear levels, each with differing locations, levels of action and styles of gameplay. Initially the player character begins on the frontlines during D-Day backed up by other computer AI-controlled soldiers with an emphasis on fast action-orientated gun-based gameplay. As the story progress however, the player character is sent on a variety of other missions including a number of covert and undercover operations in locations such as military based, German-occupied towns and manors, submarines and countryside settings. The player character is tasked with objectives during levels that range from infiltration, espionage, rescue and recon. Because of the variety between missions and locations, gameplay also changes pace. While many missions involve Allied assaults on German targets others include elements of stealth and exploration. For example one selections of missions has the player detach from an allied raid to infiltrate a German U-Boat in order to get to a secret facility while another has them rendezvous and sneak into a German headquarters in disguise to rescue an operative. Many missions are performed solo yet some include an AI companion for backup. Health is determined by a health bar that can be replenished using a selection "medikits" found throughout levels with varying degrees of effect.

During missions, players can earn medals by the end of each level be meeting requirements such as completions of objectives, eliminating an amount of enemies and maintaining a percentage of health throughout, all represented by a bronze, silver or gold star.</desc>

		<name>Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction</name>
		<desc>During the last years of his reign, the North Korean president Choi Kim attempted a reconciliation with the country's southern neighbor, with the ultimate goal of reunification. However, his son, General Choi Song, and the military clique under his leadership, strongly disagreed with the old man's views. Eventually, Choi Song orchestrated his own father's assassination, took control of North Korea, and severed ties with the outside world. 

Eventually, plans of a nuclear reactor construction began to surface. China, South Korea, the Allied Nations and even the Russian Mafia sent troops to North Korea, competing for power in the troubled region. A bounty of a hundred million dollars for General Song was declared. This is where the mercenaries enter the playfield.

Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction is a free-roaming war action and driving game with open-ended gameplay in a large world. The player can choose to control any of the three mercenary protagonists, each with their own strengths: North American Chris Jacobs can sustain higher damage; Jennifer Mui from Hong-Kong is proficient in stealth; Mattias Nilsson from Sweden can run faster than the others. Each of the mercenary also speaks different languages, which makes him or her more or less suitable for work with particular factions.

Players have free reign of a massive landscape to take bounties on the "Deck of 52", a list of most wanted criminals in North Korea, as well as a number of factions. Four factions have moved in to take advantage of the coup for personal gains; each faction will offer the player resources such as vehicles and supplies, as well as missions that the player can use to make money off of. If the player makes a faction happy, they will offer intel on the locations of various bounties from the deck. 

Players have a vast array of resources available to them to get the job done. It is possible to commandeer tanks, choppers and and any other military hardware to blow up the game's destructible landscape across the North Korean countryside. Helping out various factions provides access to numerous vehicle drops, supply drops, and air strikes.</desc>

		<desc>Metal Dungeon (?????????) is a turn-based role-playing video game developed by Panther Software for Microsoft's Xbox game system.

The game takes place in a fictional alternate reality where countries have access to highly advanced magitechnology. In the process of creating monsters with this technology using an ancient creature named "The Gods of Magic"; it broke free of its bonds and took control of the secret facility and proceeded to slay all of the research team and arm the compounds defenses. The player is a commander in charge of the Cyborg Enforcer Teams sent into the dungeon to reclaim it. The game featured 100 levels of randomly generated maps, the first ten being the games main story mode. The other 90 were extended play for players wanting to continue playing with their strong characters.

Game play[edit]
As the game starts, you create a team of Enforcers for your expeditions into the dungeon, with the option to create over 40 total. When creating your characters you are given the ability to alter height, sex, ethnicity, weight and hair style as well as given a choice between the Fencer, Caster, Analyzer, Striker, or Broader classes; Each falling into a Dungeons and Dragons styled role. Several Advanced classes were available by finding Class Chips in the dungeon and applying them to your characters. Once inside the dungeon, the players team must move around, find monsters and equipment while leveling up. A major point unsaid in game is that you are not expected to be able to beat a level's boss on the first time entering the level; as you could only allocate level up points while out of the dungeon.

Dungeons were randomly generated, most adhering to a typical design that made the map seem less random then it was. Each level has a control room that could possibly be locked, holding a boss monster that must be defeated to win the level and unlock the next one.

Fencer Fighter class that could use Hammers or Swords and had the rare chance of performing a move like a Final Fantasy "Limit Break" that would damage all enemies at once.

Analyzer Ranged class. Without an Analyzer in the party, the player is unable to know how much health enemies have and their current HP amount. Analyzers used firearms ranging from laser beams, to machine guns, to rocket launchers that all shared the same in game model.

Caster Basic Spell Caster that could be wired with a variety of Spell Chips either bought from the in-game shop or found in the dungeon. Each spell had a number of charges that had to be refilled by visiting the surface. Casters automatically blocked until the player told them what spell to use.

Broader The Jack-Of-All-Trades class that had a flat rate for all skill gains at the expense of leveling up extremely slowly and was reserved for advanced players that foresaw spending a large time grinding.

Striker A barbarian class that used combat gloves as their weapon. Each strike had a rare chance of instantly killing a non-boss enemy.

Reception[edit]
Metal Dungeon was rated very poorly for its simple game play, transparent story, and character creation system. The game's setting turned it into a cult classic near instantly for its magic-punk stylized world. The only two male African American skins available looked exactly like</desc>

		<desc>Based on the hugely successful Monopoly board games, you have the opportunity to become a millionaire and bankrupt up to four other friends.

Like the original, you must buy property, move around the board, make money and ruin your enemy to survive. This game features all you would expect of the game, fines, "GO", comunity chests and chances.

But unlike the original, your board can be made to be a sci-fi, fantasy, prehistoric or the original board.</desc>

		<name>Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</name>
		<desc>Throughout the Mortal Kombat universe, the warriors were growing too strong and numerous for the realms to handle. The warriors' powers threaten to utterly destroy the fabric of the MK universe. Upon this scene, the Elder Gods demanded a safeguard to be put in place to absorb the kombatants' insatiable bloodlust. In an enormous crater in Edenia, these warriors clashed in a single battle royale between the Forces of Light and Darkness that would threaten to rip apart reality and bring about the Apocalypse. Without warning, a mysterious pyramid rises from the ground, and the tip bursts into flames, attracting the warriors' curiosity to see what it was. The kombatants fought one another to get to the top, while Blaze, the gods' firespawn revealed himself to them. The firespawn was created by Delia, a powerful Edenian sorceress, and the mother of the main character in "Konquest" mode to destroy each fighter that would threaten him in order to save the realms from Armageddon. This would be the warriors' last battle, their last chance to prove that they are worthy of surviving, while many others will die.</desc>

		<name>Mortal Kombat: Deception</name>
		<desc>Mortal Kombat: Deception is a 3D fighting game developed and published by Midway on October 4, 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It is the sixth installment in the Mortal Kombat franchise, adding new gameplay mechanics (including a manual " Combo Breaker" system, stage-specific "death traps", and stage-specific weapons), online multiplayer, new mini-games, and a new adventure/fighting hybrid Konquest Mode that serves as the prologue to the events taking place in Mortal Kombat: Deception. The game was later released in March 1, 2005 for the GameCube and November 13, 2006 for the PlayStation Portable (under the title "Mortal Kombat: Unchained"), each with bonus characters from previous Mortal Kombat games. A bonus disc came in collector's editions of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox verions, including video biographies and a port of the original Mortal Kombat.
 
The story of Mortal Kombat: Deception takes place right after Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. As the deadly alliance of Quan Chi and Shang Tsung emerge victorious against Raiden's warriors, a new evil, the Dragon King and former emperor of Outworld Onaga, appears to seek the six artifacts (the Kamidogu) that grant him supreme power over all realms. The main protagonist is Shujinko, a warrior with the power to copy other fighter's abilities who was deceived into ressurecting Onaga prior to the main story.</desc>

		<desc>MK: SM is a 3D platforming adventure beat-em-up that is based in the Mortal Kombat world. The story begins just after the first tournament, and fills in some of the backgrounds of various characters in the series. Fighting across several areas of Earthrealm, Netherrealm, and Outworld, this game follows Liu Kang and Kung Lao (the Shaolin Monks) as they thwart another invasion of Earth. MK: SM features a wide cast of recognizable characters, many secret unlockables, as well being able to play through with a friend in Ko-op mode.

The combat is fast-paced, with numerous ways to dispose of enemies, including MK signature moves and Fatalities. This kombat goes beyond what you have seen in the fighting games, among the upgrades are: The series first Multi-Directional Kombat System, Multalities (kill multiple opponents with one move), Brutalities (see red as you unleash brutal force), ko-op only team-attacks, and even character progression (earn experience to spend on upgrades to moves). The backgrounds, all based on MK and MK II arenas, come to life with numerous hazards for the Monks that they can turn on their enemies.</desc>

		<desc>MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael is a motocross game which features two basic modes of play. One of motocross racing in which players have the standard practice/single race/season options with ongoing success unlocking more tracks and bikes. The other mode is a stunt-based motocross practice/competition mode where riders try to do as many crazy tricks in a crowd filled arena as possible within a particular amount of time. The game has a unique feature in that the bike has a controllable clutch (even for automatic gears) which must be mastered to succeed at the game. Correct use of the clutch when landing jumps of traversing troublesome terrain allows the rider's speed to be kept at a maximum. This must be used in conjunction with the "Prime Jump" button which must be held before a jump or bump to fly through the air.</desc>

		<name>Myst III: Exile</name>
		<desc>Myst III: Exile is the third title in the Myst series of graphic adventure puzzle video games. While the preceding games in the series, Myst and Riven, were produced by Cyan and published by BrÃ¸derbund, Exile was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on four compact discs for both Mac OS and Microsoft Windows on May 8, 2001; versions for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were released in late 2002.

As in previous games, the player assumes the role of the Stranger, a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book.

The creators of the Myst franchise gave the task of creating the third Myst game to Presto Studios, known for its adventure game series The Journeyman Project. Presto sought to develop a diverse and logical approach to puzzles and Ages, and worked to make the villain sympathetically multifaceted. The developers hired Jack Wall to develop a musical style different from earlier composer Robyn Miller but still recognizable as a Myst game. The project required millions of US dollars and more than two years to complete.

Exile was received well by critics; British newspaper The Daily Telegraph called it the best game in the Myst series. Conversely, long-time critics of the series complained that Exile continued to prove that Myst?'?s slower gameplay did not belong in the fast-paced modern game market; GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin described the Myst series as having lost its relevance. Despite selling more than one million copies within the first year of release, Exile fared poorer commercially than Myst and Riven, which had sold more than 10 million copies combined. Myst IV: Revelation, the fourth game in the series, was developed and published solely by Ubisoft.</desc>

		<desc>In Myst IV, you learn the fate of the two brothers from Myst 1 and must search for Yeesha, Atrus' daughter. Sirrus and Achenar have remained trapped in their prison worlds for crimes they have committed. With the disappearance of Yeesha, you must explore the two prison worlds and find her.

Like the previous games in the Myst series, the gameplay is node based and not 3-D like Uru. Myst IV is more interactive than any other previous Myst game. Using a hand as your cursor, you can push buttons, pull and push things, open and close drawers, or just tap objects. The game also contains a built in hint system with three levels of hints, each level gives more and more help on how to solve a puzzle.

The soundtrack was composed by Jack Wall with a song by artist Peter Gabriel.

Myst IV also has the addition of a zip mode, allowing you to quickly travel to places you've been before.</desc>

		<name>NARC</name>
		<desc>NARC is a 3rd-person shooter that has the player tracking the distribution of the deadly new narcotic "Liquid Soul" across two different cities in Asia and the U.S.A. The player controls one of two characters - Narcotics detective Jack Forezenski (voiced by Michael Madsen), or D.E.A. agent Marcus Hill (voiced by Bill Belamy). Both are led by Narcotics chief Joe Kowalski (voiced by Ron Pearlman), and the player switches between the two as the story unfolds.

As an undercover cop, players are free to roam the streets and dispense justice at their discretion. Aside from storyline missions, players can encounter 12 types of randomized street crimes and stop them to boost their "badge rating" (loosely, a measure of their trust within the police). Players can likewise flash their badge around to cause perps to surrender or run. Criminals that resist must be beaten in a small "struggle" minigame to get cuffed. Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station.

Alternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted. Excessive use of force against innocent civilians, or selling drugs to other undercover cops, result in major losses of badge points.</desc>

		<name>NASCAR Chase for the Cup 2005</name>
		<desc>NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup is the eighth installment of the EA Sports' NASCAR video game series. It was developed by EA Tiburon and released on August 31, 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox and on September 4, 2004 for the GameCube. NASCAR 2005 is the first game in the series to drop the word Thunder from the title since NASCAR 2001. Kevin Harvick, driver of the #29 GM Goodwrench Chevy Monte Carlo, appeared on the cover. It also marks the first time the original PlayStation has been excluded from the NASCAR lineup. This was the first NASCAR edition to be released exclusively on six generation home consoles.

Unlike previous entries, which would normally add a few extra features but leave most of the game identical to its predecessor, the game brought massive change to the series. One example is the inclusion of NASCAR series other than the NEXTEL Cup Series; the National Series (Busch Series), the Craftsman Truck Series, and the Featherlite Modified Series, plus muscle cars. More examples include the implementation of NASCAR's new Chase for the Cup points system, and Fight to the Top mode, where the player controls a custom driver throughout his career starting in the lower series and working up the ladder (similar to NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona). Another change is the absence of the cockpit view and the absence of makes and models in the Truck series, all of which appear to be Ford F-150s. Also due to failed negotiations Pocono Raceway is not included. This was the last NASCAR game released for the Nintendo GameCube. The score is composed by David Robidoux.[1</desc>

		<name>Nascar Thunder 2004</name>
		<desc>NASCAR Thunder 2004 is a racing simulator by EA Sports, released in 2003. It features the 2002 champion Tony Stewart on the cover with a scowling look to represent the new Grudges and Alliances feature. It was the only game as of 2002 to feature the previous Winston (Monster Energy) Cup Champion on the cover. The game had the most extensive soundtrack of the series up from four songs from the previous game. The game also has a career mode, season mode, Lightning Challenge mode, SpeedZone, as well as a tutorial mode featuring Richard Petty. The game is an EA Sports Bio game, and is compatible with other EA Sports Bio games like Madden NFL 2004 and NCAA Football 2004.

The main feature of the game is the "Grudges and Alliances" feature, which is based on the player's driving style and attitude. If the player drives dirty and bumps into other drivers, even if it was an unintentional bump, that driver becomes a "Rival", and will bump into the player if they happen to encounter each other later in the race. However, if the player drafts the opponent (a new feature for the game), that rival's level in grudge severity drops. If the player drafts a neutral driver long enough, that driver will become an "Ally", and at times will let the player pass. Conversely, if the player bumps into an ally, their alliance will slowly drop. The maximum amount of severity for both grudges and alliances is -100 and +100, respectively. The player can see his/her four highest grudges and alliances at the end of the race. In Season and Career modes, the grudges and alliances the player makes carry over to future races.</desc>

It was released in September 2006 for Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 3. Shaquille O'Neal is the cover athlete of the game. NBA 2K7 is the predecessor to NBA 2K8 in the NBA 2K series.

The game strives to simulate the experience of the National Basketball Association and attempts to be as realistic as possible. Players play NBA basketball games with real life teams in a variety of game modes. Players may customize the gameplay, as well as the players, and can take control of an NBA team as the general manager, hiring coaches, and making a profit. The game features all the main aspects found in the NBA, such as commentary, realistic crowd animations, and halftime shows. The game's overall gameplay, as well as the aesthetics, was said to have been significantly improved before release.

NBA 2K7 received a positive reception upon release. A lot of praise was directed at the game's overall presentation; some critics called the visuals "gorgeous", while others said it was "spectacular" and achieved great "visual feats". Most other praise was directed at the game's improved gameplay, as well as the depth and wealth of content. Some negative comments were made concerning the models and animations of the players.</desc>

The AI of the players' hold true to the players' appearance in the game and in real life. Larger players will move more slowly and fatigue quicker than smaller players.

		<desc>NBA Jam is a 3-on-3 basketball video game published by Acclaim Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2003. It is part of the NBA Jam series. The game was announced on May 12, 2003. The play-by-play is voiced by Tim Kitzrow.[2] There was also originally to be a GameCube version of the game.[3]

The game is based on the 2003â04 NBA season and features some of the NBA's best players from that season. After a series of more simulation-oriented Jam games, NBA Jam features fast-paced gameplay more akin to the arcade originals. The game also features various courts and special teams, including all-star teams composed of various NBA legends. It is the last NBA Jam released by Acclaim, as the company became defunct the following year.

NBA Jam would also be the last Jam game released until Electronic Arts revived the franchise with its 2010 NBA Jam game.</desc>

		<desc>NCAA College Football 2K3 is an American football video game released in 2002 by Visual Concepts. The cover athlete is former Nebraska Cornhuskers quarterback Eric Crouch. It is the second College Football game by Visual Concepts (the first being NCAA College Football 2K2: Road to the Rose Bowl   for the Dreamcast ). The game also has ESPN style game play, meaning at half-time it gives you a report on your game and others around the league. It includes an editable roster, but you cannot name the players as, traditionally, NCAA athletes are referred to as "John Doe" and not by their full name. There are basic game modes such as the dynasty or jump into a quick play. Dynasty is where you lead your team over the course of a year to the National Championship. Legacy mode is when you completely take over a team, control its recruiting classes, and remain a "Division 1" powerhouse. The game was also the last college football video game made by Visual Concepts.</desc>

Dynasty mode has been enhanced with the ability to redshirt a player and schedule your non-conference games before each season. In Dynasty Mode you can win all the real trophies to add to your own personal collection which you can show off later. These awards include the Heisman, Coach of the Year and Bowl-specific trophies. You can also win special trophies for winning certain rivalry games, which is another new play mode in 2003. There are 23 different "Rivalry" trophies for you to earn to go alongside your Dynasty trophies. 

Create-A-School mode makes it into this edition, letting you create your own football team. Everything from the logos on the field to your school's fight song can be customized. Your created team can be played in Exhibition play or imported into Dynasty mode.

The last notable feature new to NCAA Football 2003 is the customizable interface. You choose your favorite team and the game interface will be based around your team's fight song, mascot, logos and school colors.</desc>

		<name>NCAA Football 07</name>
		<desc>Another update of EA's perennial NCAA collegiate football franchise, this edition features updated rosters and stats. It also has new features such as a momentum meter, the more players either in favor or against a team, the more the meter will light up or darken, affecting the teams morale and success of plays. It also has a new kicking meter along with spring drills, letting players update their stats along with a new Spring Game where players can scout out their new players in exhibition games.

Aside from the PSP version, Campus Legend is also a novelty - an update of the Race for the Heisman mode of the previous edition and it is quite similar to the NFL Superstar mode from the Madden franchise. A new player starts at football camp, practises and is eventually awarded a scholarship to play in a division. Rather than a single drill, it is now a series of four. Where in the previous version players could choose a scholarship, the game now offers a selection from the available schools based on the performances. Once enrolled, players choose a major, follow progress reports, read headlines in the school newspaper and have a dorm room where fan mail arrives. The player's girlfriend, shown as a photo of the wall, becomes more beautiful based on the success in the games. Days consist of attending classes, practice, studying, meeting tutors, drills or social activities. These can also boost popularity and overall success. Characters can be uploaded to Madden 07 where it can determine their draft position. The game is also aligned with ESPN, updating with real news from ESPN Radio and ESPN.com. It features the voice talents of Lee Corso, Brad Nessler and Kirk Herbstreit.

The 360 version lacks the Spring Drills and Campus Legend modes. Instead it has improved graphics and a series of mini-games.

		<desc>NCAA Football 08 is a college football video game created by EA Sports, the sports video gaming subsidiary of Electronic Arts. It is the successor to NCAA Football 07 in the NCAA Football series. It was officially announced with the launch of the NCAA 08 page on the EA Sports website on February 20, 2007.[1] EA Sports had opened up a ballot on their NCAA Football 07 site in which fans can vote on a feature to be implemented into the PlayStation 2 version, making it the first console announced for the game and announcing at least one of its features.[2] Fans could vote for either in-game saves, medical red shirts, summer workouts or a lead blocker feature. The option of medical red shirts was voted on and won, and this option is on the Dynasty Mode on all versions of NCAA Football 08. This allows for players that are injured in the middle of the year to apply to gain another year of eligibility. The game was released on July 17, 2007, and the first time release on PlayStation 3, marking the eleventh installment of the NCAA Football series bearing the title "NCAA Football". As with NCAA Football 07, 08 features limited ESPN integration.</desc>

		<name>NCAA March Madness 2004</name>
		<desc>Electronic Arts' college basketball series returns for another year on the PlayStation 2 and makes its debut on the Xbox with NCAA March Madness 2004.

The number of included teams has been doubled to over 320 from the predecessor and several authentic arenas have been added. All the previous year's game modes return, including single games, tournaments, season and dynasty. Newly added are the mascot game, in which the teams consist of players in their schools' mascot outfits. A rivalry mode allows a quick set-up of a game pitching classic rival teams against each other. The dynasty mode has added Campus Challenges: by completing these challenges in dynasty games, players earn points that can be used to improve players' stats. Exclusive to the PS2 version is the introduction of online multiplayer, featuring single games and tournaments.

Some of the gameplay changes on the court were previously seen in NBA Live 2004: these include the separation of the buttons for dunks and shots and the introduction of the pro hop button, which allows for context-sensitive special offensive moves.</desc>

		<name>NFL Blitz Pro</name>
		<desc>NFL Blitz Pro is the 2003 entry in Midway's arcade football series. Like NHL Hitz Pro however, this entry moves away from its arcade roots toward more of a simulation style, while still retaining some arcade flavor in that there are no penalties or injuries and players can "catch on fire". The main changes to the predecessors are full 11-on-11 teams, standard 10 yard downs and more support for running plays.

Game modes include Quick Play and Exhibition, a full Season, a 10-season Franchise and 4- or 8-player tournaments. There also is a create-a-player feature. While there are no hot routes and audibles are limited to a pre-determined set of four, the Impact Player feature allows control of one specific player who can make last-minute adjustments. Only the PlayStation 2 version includes an online mode for multiplayer games and roster updates.

The game has many special features unlockable through the Blitz Shop. Credits for the shop are earned by performing feats in non-franchise games. Available for purchase are fantasy teams and stadiums, and new game modes: in Butterfingaz mode, every hit leads to a fumble, while Cyberleague features robot teams and an exploding ball. Also available is the customary Big Head mode, among several others. Old-school Blitz series arcade gameplay is available in Blitz Classic mode.</desc>

The included teams and players have been updated for the 2002 NFL season, with the newly formed eight divisions and the expansion team Houston Texans included. All the predecessor's game modes return, which include Practice, Single Games and Season. Practice mode has added tactical tutorials called Chalk Talks. Season mode again includes the 25-season dynasty mode, and replaces last year's Fantasy Challenge with the Classic Challenge, a ladder tournament against classic NFL teams. A new addition to dynasty mode is the Super Bowl challenge - when winning the Super Bowl, the dynasty team is challenged by a previous champion. Defeating champions in the Super Bowl or Classic Challenge unlocks classic players and teams for use.

New options are Xbox Live support for online multiplayer and downloadable roster updates. Local multiplayer via System Link is also supported. New customization options include a play editor for custom plays and playbooks as well as as uniform and stadium editors.</desc>

		<desc>Hit the ice with EA Sports' NHL 06 for the XBOX. This entry in the NHL series builds on the 2005 version by adding new rules and an up to date rooster that includes just about every big name in the National Hockey League. NHL 06 includes everything from NHL 05, including the revamped shooting controls. New to the 2006 version is the use of the left analog stick for deking, which in hockey terms means to dodge and fake out defenders. The right analog stick is used to pull off fancy moves like a spin or between the legs pass. These fancy moves will distract goalkeepers, giving the gamer an opening to shoot. The drawback to these moves is that only superstar characters can pull them off regularly. The game includes many of the traditional hockey game modes, including dynasty mode. In dynasty mode, gamers will control their own hockey team and have to deal with outside pressures, sponsors, and more while trying to meet the team philosophy, which is different for each team. Other modes include single season, leagues and tournaments, quick game, and online play. The graphics of NHL 06 are top notch. This time, they've been tweaked to accurately show character size differences. The defense players and goalkeepers, who are traditionally larger players, actually look larger, while the smaller and faster scorers are indeed a little thinner and smaller. This is just one small change that adds to the overall amazing gameplay of NHL 06.</desc>

		<desc>EA Sports' 2007 installment of their NHL Hockey franchise refreshes all of the existing NHL team rosters and schedules and adds the Czech Elite League teams to the European Elite League rosters.

Player modeling has been improved and features new life-like player specific moves and styles. Additional enhancements to the analog stick controls have also been made, making players easier than ever to control, while still mainting the realism of true hockey.

Other features returning from previous editions include GM Mode, single game and season play, Dynasty mode and online play.</desc>

		<desc>Midway introduces hockey with its no-rules twist that is seen in NFL Blitz. Hockey may have fewer rules than football, but NHL Hitz features hard-hitting action and very simple 3-on-3 gameplay. The game has franchise modes for a created team that you can design along with championship and exhibition modes. You earn attribute points and credits that you can use to unlock items and improve your players along the way. There are several mini-games and extras hidden deep in the game for you to unlock. NHL Hitz is Midway's attempt at making the most action-packed hockey game to ever hit consoles.</desc>

		<name>NHL Rivals 2004</name>
		<desc>NHL Rivals 2004 is the first NHL title for the Xbox, developed by MGS (Microsoft Game Studios), and the second title developed under the XSN Sports banner - the development team's first foray into hockey on console.

At the time of its release, the visuals in this game were its major selling point, with each player's face mapped onto their model ingame. The game features a fully animated polygonal crowd, tons of motion-captured animations, NHL licensed players, teams and arenas. The look and feel of the game are much different than games like EA's NHL series.

This was also the first hockey game on Xbox that let players play in online tournaments and leagues over Xbox Live and XSN Sports. Rosters were updated as the season went on via content downloads over Xbox Live, though were only available for a limited time.

Rivals 2004 features the gameplay mode of 3-on-3 pond hockey. This pickup-game style of play is meant for those who prefer instant action, and it can also be played over Xbox Live. Players can connect and join in on a recreational game intended to simulate the fun pickup games that many people played as kids.

The gameplay is arcade-like, with fast play and quick passing via a button or in specific directions using the analog stick</desc>

		<name>Ninja Gaiden Black</name>
		<desc>Ninja Gaiden Black and Ninja Gaiden Sigma. The game follows the fictional story of Ryu Hayabusa, a master ninja, in his quest to recover a stolen sword and avenge the slaughter of his clan.

Tecmo specifically targeted Ninja Gaiden at a non-Japanese audience, and despite difficulties in obtaining content ratings due to the game's graphic depictions of violence, it was generally well received, and 362,441 copies were sold in North America in the first month after its release. Nevertheless, the game had to be censored for release in some regions, and Japanese sales were poor, with only 60,000 in the four months following its release. Making use of the Xbox's internet connectivity, Ninja Gaiden was the focus of a series of online contests across North America, Europe and Japan. Record-breaking numbers of players took part, competing for places in the live final, which was held during the Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2004.

Team Ninja continued to update the game after its release: two Hurricane Packs were made available as free downloadable content that added extra content, gameplay challenges, and game engine improvements.[1] These were incorporated into a reworked version, released in 2005 and entitled Ninja Gaiden Black, that was regarded by the game's creator Tomonobu Itagaki and many players as the definitive version. In 2007, Ninja Gaiden was graphically enhanced on the PlayStation 3, with extra content, in the form of Ninja Gaiden Sigma. This version was later released on the PlayStation Vita as Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus.</desc>

Viewed from a third person over-the-shoulder perspective, in typical action-adventure fashion Ryu starts the game with basic, low-level abilities and weapons that can be upgraded as he progresses, by discovering or buying items. In keeping with his ninja persona, his character can interact with the game environment to perform acrobatic feats, such as running along and jumping off walls, swinging from pole to pole, or running across water.</desc>

One group of brave teens decides to find out what's going on... no matter what. They have no idea what kind of horrors have gripped the school and everyone in it. In the darkness, the evil has power... but add light and they can be defeated. Will they survive the night ahead?

In Solo Mode, choose from 5 characters with different personalities, aptitude and perspectives. Change between them at any time (as long as they are still alive).

The player can also select a second person (as a "teammate") to accompany the player by going to a "gathering point" in the game. At any time during play, the player can switch control between the first character and the second, thereby accessing their special talents.

There are several basic types of weapons used in the game: contact (a baseball bat for instance), pistols, guns, and more exotic, high-powered "special" weapons. Ammunition is specific for each gun or pistol and is not interchangeable. Weapons can be swapped between characters and ammunition found is stored in the group's reserves for sharing amongst them.</desc>

		<desc>Munch is a lonely Gabbit - a gentle frog-like creature who communicates with other members of its species through echolocation. Munch searches in vain for others of his kind: his entire race has been exterminated, since the Gabbit eggs ("gabbiar") is a delicacy, and their lungs have been used by the chain-smoking, powerful Glukkons to replace their own. The last of the Gabbits is captures by two Vykkers, owners of Vykkers Labs, where they conduct experiments on living creatures. The two implant a sonar device in Munch's head, concocting a plan to enslave him and use him to trap other animals. However, Munch discovers that the implant has given him new powers; using those, he begins to free the vicious Fuzzles, whom the Vykkers have been using in their laboratories, hoping to escape himself and help other creatures who suffer under the yoke of the Glukkons. Munch's Oddysee is set in the fictional Oddworld universe; its events take place after those of Abe's Exoddus. The player controls Munch as well as Abe, the hero of the previous Oddworld games. Abe's abilities haven't changed much since the last installment: as before, GameSpeak must be used to communicate with other creatures, leading them to safety. His fellow Mudokons can now be ordered to attack enemies. Abe can also grab and toss Mudokons or Munch to lead them to area they cannot access otherwise. Possessing enemies also comes into play, and is needed to solve many of the puzzles. Possession abilities can now be used to ignite quarrels between enemies and make them fight each other.</desc>

When he hears that a town populated by Grubbs has been invaded by a demon, the Stranger ventures there. The town was once protected by a race of creatures known as the Steef, who now appear to be completely extinct. The Stranger soon discovers that a nearby river has been dried up by a dam, built by a person called Sekto. The Stranger must confront this person as he continues to hunt down outlaws, revealing nothing about his past. Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is set in the fictional Oddworld universe, differing in many ways from the preceding installment. The game incorporates two basic genres: third-person platforming action and first-person shooter. The player can switch between the modes at any time by using a melee or a ranged weapon, respectively. The goal of the game, for the most part, is to bag the outlaws and bring them in, collecting "moolah" (the game's currency) in the process. The Stranger can stun or knock down enemies, as well as use a stealthy approach, e.g. hiding in long grass to surprise the enemy.</desc>

Since Raikoh can stay long in mid-air and even rise up higher by executing certain slashes, fights take place in all three directions of the area.</desc>

		<name>Outlaw Volleyball</name>
		<desc>Outlaw Volleyball is the second game in Simon &amp; Schuster's growing Outlaw franchise.

As the title suggests, you play various games of volleyball with shady and dirty characters, from a slutty biker to an ex con to a pair of strippers. There are sixteen players in total. Each character has his or her own unique personality, strengths and weaknesses.

There are four different modes you can compete in; Exhibition, which is a standard volleyball game, Tour, which is the career mode that spans fifty different events, and Drills, which are sort of like practice games that awards points you can use to improve your player's abilities. The fourth mode is Xbox Live enabled, allowing you to play with people over the Xbox Live service.

There are ten different courts to play on, each one with it's own backgrounds and animation. You can play on a beach, at a carnival, or even in a prison.

Outlaw Volleyball utilizes the same momentum feature first seen in Outlaw Golf, which allows you to earn "beating tokens" that you can spend on beating up the other team. If you are doing lousy, beating up a member of the other team refills your momentum meter, allowing you to come back and possibly win.</desc>

		<desc>Long ago, back in medieval times, an evil spirit known as Spooky had terrorized all of Pac-Land. In response to this, the great Wizard Pac created a potion that turned 5 ordinary fruit into the "Golden Fruit." A young knight called Sir Pac-alot fought and sealed Spooky underneath a large tree using the Golden Fruit, which were attached to the branches of the tree. In the present time late at night, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde sneak into the village and, in their mischief, pick the Golden Fruit off the tree in the center of town. Unfortunately, this has released Spooky from his prison. Spooky tells the ghosts to take the Golden Fruit and follow him if they wish to rid the land of the Pac-people forever. When Pac-Man awakes, he hears the news from Professor Pac about the Golden Fruit and Spooky, and sets off to defeat the ghosts and Spooky.</desc>

Jack suspects that it was more than just a Scavenger conflict, as the surface to air missile was too advanced for scavengers to have obtained on their own.</desc>

		<desc>Phantom Dust (???????? Fantomu Dasutu?) is a video game for the Xbox console. It was developed by Microsoft Game Studios, produced and directed by Yukio Futatsugi, director of the critically acclaimed Panzer Dragoon for Sega Saturn. It was licensed for release in the U.S. by Majesco. Phantom Dust is a pseudo-card-based action/strategy game in which the player collects skills (over 300 total) and takes missions to attempt to discover why Earth is in the condition it is. Players construct "arsenals" (similar to decks of cards) from their acquired skills and then use them to battle against other players. The game incorporates strategy and action elements in to a game that requires both mental and reflexive skill.

The game remains a cult hit.

The Xbox Live servers no longer support Online Multiplayer for Phantom Dust, or any other Xbox Original game.</desc>

		<name>Playboy: The Mansion</name>
		<desc>Play as Hugh Hefner and build the Playboy publishing empire while throwing parties, hanging out with celebrities, and, of course, inviting beautiful models into your mansion. Playboy: The Mansion is a social strategy game that calls on players to build a virtual empire of wealth, celebrity, and freedom from puritanical repression and intolerance. This is accomplished by developing a fully functioning Playboy mansion, to attract and accommodate influential celebrities and beautiful young models who are willing to strike the right poses. Players who can build a suitably entertaining and well-equipped mansion, while adhering to "the Playboy philosophy," are rewarded with "the Playboy lifestyle," surrounded by powerful trendsetters, influential pop idols, and sexually liberated young women. In short, the game invites players to take the role of a virtual Hugh Hefner. 

As Hef, players will be responsible for keeping the Playboy brand relevant to its ever-evolving audience. One good way to do this is by attracting celebrity friends to the mansion, and making sure they have a good time when they visit. With enough money, players can build new facilities -- like swimming pools, movie theaters, or tennis courts -- which may have special appeal to particular celebrities. It's also a good idea to introduce these V.I.P. guests to Playmates who share their interests. The game's main interface should be familiar to Sims 2 players; characters are directed through their 3D domestic environments with mouse clicks, and clicked objects offer pop-up menus of available interactions.

Coaxing powerful celebrity friends to appear in an issue of Playboy magazine can boost circulation, bringing in more income for future developments. As Hef, players can determine the content of each issue, choosing the articles, essays, cover shots, and centerfolds. They'll also have an opportunity to direct the photo shoots, choosing the location on the mansion grounds, the model, and the wardrobe selection -- all of which feature a "topless" option. The game includes a structured campaign that follows Hefner's real-life rise to international celebrity through a series of individual scenarios that focus on building the fame, circulation, and clout it took to develop the Playboy brand into what it is today. Players design their own challenges in the "Empire" mode, where they can set their own goals and victory conditions.</desc>

		<desc>Mini motorcycles in the King's garden. Jump on a pocketbike and let 'er rip in this budget title from Burger King. Pocketbike's are small motorcycles that go really really fast. In Pocketbike Racer you get to choose from various Burger King characters including; The King, Brooke Burke, Subservient Chicken and Whopper Jr along with a biker and some generic humans.

The racing levels feature power-ups and weapons to use against your competition. You also have a Turbo bar that builds up depending upon your racing skills. The levels include, King's Garden, Burger King Parking Lot, and Fantasy Ranch which features streets of cheese. The levels themselves include hairpins, straightaways, and jumps where you can test out the game's cartoony physics. 

The game also features a somewhat limited create-your-own-character mode where you can recolor all the non-mascot characters.

The weapons you can use on the tracks include the standard rockets and lightning bolts as well as firecrackers and an attack to reverse an opponents control for several seconds. Your turbo/weapons meter is charged by passing through gates set up on each level. This can be used for turbo boosts of course, but it also controls the weapons. The weapons are not picked up, but are available whenever you have your meter full enough to power them with the stronger weapons using more of the meter.</desc>

		<name>ProStroke Golf: World Tour 2007</name>
		<desc>ProStroke Golf: World Tour 2007 is a golf simulation which unique feature is the innovative control scheme. In contrast to other golf simulations the tee is performed in first person mode. After choosing the club and the feet position the player needs to use both analog sticks. With the left one he simulates the swing and with the right one he relocates his body weight. It is not enough to relocate it simply in the right direction, the player needs to achieve a constant back and forth movement. 

This only works when using a gamepad, alternatively there is also a more traditional three-click control scheme in 3rd person. There the player chooses the body weight movement before the strike. With the first click he strikes out, with the second one he determines the precision and with the last one the strength. This, however, is still different to other golf simulations because the kind of swing is not chosen beforehand but determined by the swing parameters.

Less innovative are the playing modes. The game features the usual training, single tournament and career mode. The career mode however are just many tournaments tacked together. The player character improves his rank with successes but this just influences the conditions of participation for other tournaments and not the gameplay itself.

The game features nine licensed golfers, 18 courses (two licensed) and three real-life golf-commentators. With the editor the player can build own courses and tournaments.</desc>

		<desc>Set in the near future, a Psi-Agent names Nick Scryer has his memory wiped and false memories implanted so that he can infiltrate a terrorist group known as "The Movement". Now believing he is an anti-terrorist soldier, he helps defend a facility from the Movement but is captured. Aided by a beautiful double agent named Sara, Nick escapes from his captors, begins to regain his Psi powers and fights to get closer to the truth surrounding this elusive secret society and the man who runs it, a U.S. Military rogue known only as "The General".

The Psi powers are a key aspect to the gameplay in Psi-Ops and open up experiences not possible with traditional weapons only, especially given that our environments contain a huge number of objects (and enemies!) that the player can interact with. The combination of unique Psi powers, a great physics engine from Havok, allowing for highly-realistic body and object reactions, and highly interactive worlds allows players an almost infinite way to get by each challenge in the game.</desc>

		<desc>The story is set in Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, a remote US government training facility under the guise of a children's summer camp. The area was hit centuries ago by a meteor made of psitanium (a fictional element that can grant psychic powers or strengthen existing powers), creating a huge crater. The psitanium affected the local wildlife, giving them limited psychic powers, such as bears with the ability to attack with telekinetic claws and cougars with pyrokinesis. The Native Americans of the area called psitanium "whispering rock", which they used to build arrowheads. When settlers began inhabiting the region, the psychoactive properties of the meteor slowly drove them insane. An asylum was built to house the afflicted, but within fifteen years the asylum had more residents than the town did. The government relocated the remaining inhabitants and flooded the crater to prevent further settlement, creating what is now Lake Oblongata. The asylum still stands but has fallen into disrepair.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Pump It Up Exceed.iso</path>
		<name>Pump It Up: Exceed</name>
		<desc>Pump It Up: Exceed is a dancing game similar to the games in the Dance Dance Revolution series. The Pump It Up dance mat is different from the norm as the arrows are set on diagonals and includes a button in the middle which allows for more complexity in the dance moves that are required to be performed in the game.

The general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the Pump It Up dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends.

The game has several mode to choose from:
Arcade Mode has the player trying to achieve an âAâ or an âSâ rating on three consecutive songs. Doing that allows the player to play an extra song. Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode.
Home Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them.
Sudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends.
Survival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode. This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted.
Video Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed.
Tutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works.
The game also keeps track of the players statistics (the rating grades they received for each song). 

The PS2 version of the game features 101 songs, while the Xbox version contains 97 songs, but offers the option to download more songs. As some songs are more difficult then others, the game provides a rating from one to twenty to inform the player on just how hard of a task they are taking on by choosing a particular song.Two dance mats will be required for some songs that offer a freestyle option if the player chooses that setting.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Quantum Redshift.iso</path>
		<name>Quantum Redshift</name>
		<desc>Quantum Redshift is a futuristic racing game for the Xbox console, developed by Curly Monsters and published by Microsoft Game Studios in 2002. Created by Wipeout designer Nick Burcombe, the game puts the player in the shoes of 16 different characters, paired off in rivalries, whose stories unfold as tournaments are completed. The game has five different speed limits, which act as the difficulty levels for the game. Points earned after races allow players to upgrade their hovercraft's offensive and defensive capabilities. The game featured a soundtrack by Dutch musician Junkie XL.

While featuring 16 different characters, critics generally noted that there was not anything particularly "likable" about the characters.

Despite the critical response to Quantum Redshift being positive, garnering 76% at GameRankings, the game sold poorly. As a result, the second game, which was to include multi-play over Xbox Live was cancelled by Microsoft, and Curly Monsters closed shop shortly thereafter. As Curly Monsters said a statement before they closed down "We were pursuing a number of avenues, and we'd developed some really cool new Xbox technology, but unfortunately we were not able to sign a deal prior to us running out of cash... we've not been able to pay our staff for the last month, and now it's time to (unfortunately) call it quits... I expect you'll see and hear from us in various guises as we spread out amongst other developers."

The biggest selling point of Quantum Redshift was the graphics detail it possessed. Water and glass would show real-time reflections, each of the game worlds were abundant with high-resolution textures, and the camera "lens" would be flecked with water droplets after being submerged. Quantum Redshift was rated as one of the most graphically advanced games for the Xbox.</desc>

The player must prepare his men in advance by deciding how to organize them into teams and how they'll be outfitted, specifying everything from the type of body armor they will wear to the ammunition they will fire. Each member of Rainbow has different strengths and weaknesses which must be exploited depending on the nature of the mission. If during a mission any member happens to be killed they will be permanently removed from the roster and replaced with a less qualified stand-in. The option exists to load an alternate set of pre-defined arrangements for each individual mission, circumventing this stage of planning.</desc>

		<name>Real World Golf</name>
		<desc>Real World Golf is a golfing game that makes use of the Gametrak system. The Gametrak is an external piece of hardware that is included with the game. The Gametrak can, through the use of gloves which are connected to it with tiny wires, accurately read out the swing the player makes with the included tiny golf club. It determines the power with which you hit, but also any effects you may put on the ball. The Gametrak can read out speeds ranging from 2000 miles per hour to 1 millimeter per hour.

Once you start the game you no longer need to use your keyboard or gamepad, all menus can be navigated with use of simple hand gestures. The game itself contains ten 18-hole courses which have to be unlocked one by one. You can play in various modes such as tournament, championship, training and party. Party mode includes several mini games such as hitting cars in the parking lot, hitting a giant bulls-eye in the sky, hitting as close to a target as possible or hitting through hoops. Each game mode can be played against the AI or friends in hotseat multiplayer.</desc>

		<name>Reservoir Dogs</name>
		<desc>This game, based on the famous Quentin Tarantino movie Reservoir Dogs, fills in the gaps in the movie that are only briefly mentioned (like the robbery at the jewelry store). Throughout the story you get to play all seven main characters, from Mr. Blonde to Mr. White. 

The missions are introduced by game engine cutscenes, which often recreate moments from the film. For example, in the first mission you see Mr. Pink holding his famous monologue "I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up!" and then you play Mr. Blue as the police arrives at the jewelry where your goal is to get out alive.

To do so, you have two choices: be a psychopath and shoot your way out, or try the subtle approach without harming anyone. For instance, if you do not want to harm anyone you can take a hostage and then threaten the police to lay their weapons down and order them to face the wall. There are a few missions in which you must drive a car but mostly you walk through them. Like in the Hitman series, the game shows at the end of every mission how well you have done.</desc>

		<desc>RoboCop(titled RoboCop: Aratanaru Kiki in Japan) is a 2003 first person shooter released for the sixth generation home consoles. The only North American version available was released for the Xbox while the PAL region versions were released on all consoles except for Game Boy Advance.[18] A Japan-only version was released on GameCube. This was the last game Titus Software developed before going bankrupt in 2005.

The game allows the player to play as RoboCop and to uncover a sinister plot involving OCP, local gangsters dealing a deadly new synthetic drug and a powerful cyborg known only as MIND. As a last hope, RoboCop must capture, destroy, or arrest hostile characters in a desperate search for clues and evidence.

The game received mostly negative reviews by critics. GameSpot rated it 2.2/10, the official Xbox Magazine UK rated it a mediocre 5.9/10, GamerFeed gave it a 2/5, Xbox Magazine gave 2/10, and NTSC UK rated it 3/10.[19] The Scandinavian magazine Gamereactor gave the game 1/10[20] and called it "the worst videogame since Superman 64" (also from Titus Software).</desc>

		<desc>On the hostile planet of Nu Earth, there are tales of a lone warrior. A man who appears out of thin air to take out whole platoons, then disappears back into the shadows. In the centre of a futile war, one man can swing the balance: the ultimate soldier and last survivor of the massacred Genetic Infantrymen, hell-bent on revenge ... the Rogue Trooper.

Based on the 2000AD comic series, Rogue Trooper, Rogue Trooper blends intense third person action and next generation stealth. Rogue's arsenal offers him a unique advantage over his opponents; encoded bio-chips containing the digitized personalities of his fallen comrades are implanted in his gun (Gunnar), helmet (Helm) and backpack (Bagman). Rogue Trooper features intense online gameplay modes, where gamers can experience up to four-player co-operative gameplay in all new maps.</desc>

		<name>Samurai Warriors</name>
		<desc>Samurai Warriors is Koei's extension of the popular Dynasty Warriors series. Instead of taking place during the Three Kingdoms era in China, Samurai Warriors takes you back to feudal Japan, during the warring states era. In the game, you take control of actual historical figures such as Yukimura Sanada, Nobunaga Oda, and Hattori Hanzo. Altogether, there are fifteen characters, ten of whom need to be unlocked.

Basically, gameplay is almost identical to that of Dynasty Warriors. The main differences are things like the inclusion of indoor castle levels, and a greater variety of enemies. In Dynasty Warriors, enemies were basically either soldiers or archers. In Samurai Warriors, there are soldiers, archers, musketeers, and many different types of ninjas. In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending. Updated graphics and a more "techno-ish" soundtrack top off the additions.</desc>

		<desc>Fred brings the rest of Mystery, Inc. along to meet his cousin, Jed, who works at the Monstrous Fright &amp; Magic. MFM is a special effects company that creates monster costumes with a special formula they invented called, âMubberâ, that makes the costumes seems so real that the wearer literally becomes the actual monster. When they arrive, they found the location in shambles. Winslow Stanton, the creator of Mubber and owner of MFM, told them someone has stolen the Mubber formula and by using it with their animatrons, destroyed the building and disappeared. He believes it is Jedâs doing because he, too, disappeared. Looks like itâs up to Scooby and the gang to find Jed, destroy the costumed monsters and unmask the truth behind this great mystery!

In Scooby-Doo! Unmasked, you will guide Scooby to help Mystery, Inc. uncover clues, fight monsters and occasionally save your friends from danger. You will be visiting many several worlds including a China Town and a museum. You will encounter various monsters like the Chinese Zombie and the Black Knight and the only way to get past them is by attacking them with your spin, slide, roll and smash attacks! Also, by collecting mubbers, you can create special costumes that will give you special powers. For example, with the Kung Fu Costume, you will be able to move around with greater agility and force. Be sure to watch your health level which is indicated by the number of Scooby Medals you have. If you reach zero, you will restart at the last save point but you can restore your health by collecting enough Scooby snacks that can be found throughout the game. Also, by collecting food items you can get Shaggy to cook you a special meal that will increase the total number of medals you have.

In each world, when youâve collected enough clues, Velma will ask you a few questions in order to figure out who is behind everything, and you must select the clues that you feel will answer these questions. When thatâs completed, you will have to fight a boss before Velma will reveal who the identity of the villain.

Scooby-Doo! Unmasked can be saved at any point in the game simply by selecting Save Game in the Pause Menu. You can also turn on the Autosave function which will enable the game to automatically save at different points. You can replay any level as many times as you want so you can collect any missing items you still lack. In the extra menu, you will find Bonus Arts that features various conceptual art pieces used in the making of the game.</desc>

		<name>Scrapland</name>
		<desc>American McGee presents SCRAPLAND is a third-person 3D action game set on an asteroid called Scrapland, a ruined paradise rebuilt by robots, the only inhabitants now. The player controls D-Tritus, a self-constructed young robot that has just arrived Chimera, the main city. The adventure begins when he accepts a job as journalist and strange things start to happen...

The game is a mix between free-form outdoor levels and indoor levels with combat and puzzle-solving elements. During said indoor levels the player can instantly change his form between 14 robots, all with their own advantages and special abilities. Utilizing those robots is important to solve puzzles or mini games, e.g. only a tiny robot can fit into small spaces and only certain robots are allowed into the areas. However, those disguises can be seen through by certain enemy types. Then it is a good idea to change to a robot with fighting abilities - aiming is basically done automatically by the game.

The outdoor levels can be freely explored, but there is not much more to do then flying to next mission objective or indoor level. The parts of the space ship can be upgraded individually; better parts are gained during the game and by solving optional missions. The player can have up to nine different space ships and switch between them if needed - a heavy one is better suited for fights while a small one is useful for races.

Additionally the game features various outdoor areas which can be started outside the campaign and three multiplayer modes.</desc>

		<desc>Hidden away in underground leagues and counter-culture clubs, Sega introduces a brutal new brand of soccer. Played by thugs who kick ass on and off the field, participants opt to watch their backs and let the crowds watch the game. Since nastiness supplants sportsmanship in this 3-on-3 hybrid of the world's most popular sport, the rulebook is only good as a splint for broken bones.

Given its rule-bending recipe, Soccer Slam is an exciting and original game, in which individual achievement prevails over teamwork while gameplay focuses on speed, skill, and aggression. This means that players don't just take on the competition, they take 'em out!</desc>

		<desc>This version of Serious Sam is based on Serious Sam: Gold, with several notable differences. Like the Gold Edition, it features levels from both first and second chapters; the weapons from the second part can be used when playing the levels of the first one as well. The levels are generally somewhat smaller than in the PC release. 

The most significant change comes in the form of a life system. Scoring 100,000 points grants the protagonist an additional life, allowing him to respawn at the same place after having been killed, rather than forcing the player to return to the last checkpoint. Combo points are awarded for executing specific attacks rapidly, contributing to the overall score. The save system has been somewhat modified, with telephone booths representing checkpoints.</desc>

		<name>Shattered Union</name>
		<desc>Shattered Union is a turn-based strategy game, set in 2014 in the United States against a background story of a second American civil war. The player can control any of seven different factions, each of which has at least one unique unit and its own set of sidebar powers:
California Commonwealth
Pacifica
The Republic of Texas
Great Plains Federation
The Confederacy
New England Alliance
The European Union Occupation
Russia
These factions wage warfare in different territories; the more territories are controlled, the more income a faction receives. When attacking such a territory, the player selects which of his units should be deployed. The battlefield is represented as a hex grid, though the graphics are full 3D. The objective of the battle is either to destroy all the enemy's units or capture enough objective towns to control the battlefield.

Apart from the campaign, the game provides both a single- and a multiplayer skirmish mode, allowing one-on-one battles.</desc>

Shrek 2 features a mixture of puzzle solving and enemy bashing. Players are able to control one of four characters at any given time -- swapping between them at will. Each character has a set of basic attack moves and a special ability. Donkey has a "Burro Blast" that can knock down large objects, Shrek can pick up and throw heavy objects, and Fiona -- in a nod to her fight scene in the first movie -- can slow down time, Matrix-style.</desc>

All the regular Shrek crew is included, such as Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, and Puss n' Boots, along with some newcomers such as Cap'n Hook, the Black Knight, and Quasimodo the Hunchback.

Each character has their own special moves that capture the humor of the franchise (such as Shrek's "Green Storm" gas bombs), and the environments are colorful, filled with odd weapons, and highly destructible.

Players have the option of following a story mode (where Donkey tells his half-breed Donkey kids a strange bedtime story), or just participating in straight-up brawls or minigame-like challenges. Multiplayer, of course, is a big focus on the game, and it allows up to 4 players to slam each other all day long.</desc>

With the never ending talk of Donkey following him along his path, Shrek must rescue Princess Fiona from the dragon, as requested by Farquaad, while finding his way through crazy characters from the fairy (and not so fairy) tale kingdom.

New characters and events stir up further adventure as the player relives the events from the movie in this third-person action game. Shrek bashes and burps his way past various challenges, fighting knights and other evil things while collecting items to boost his health and power.</desc>

		<name>Silent Hill 2: Inner Fears</name>
		<desc>Silent Hill 2 (??????? 2 Sairento Hiru Ts??) is a survival horror video game published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 and developed by Team Silent, a production group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. The game was released in September 2001 as the second installment in the Silent Hill series. An extended version of the game was published for Xbox in December of the same year, containing a short bonus scenario and other minor additions. It was later ported to the Microsoft Windows operating system in 2002. A remastered high-definition version of the game was released for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 in 2012 as part of the Silent Hill HD Collection.

While set in the series' eponymous fictional American town, Silent Hill 2 is not a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game. Instead, it centers on James Sunderland, who enters the town after receiving a letter written by his deceased wife, saying she is waiting for him in their "special place" in Silent Hill. Joined by Maria, who strongly resembles her, he searches for her and discovers the truth about her death. Additional material in re-releases and ports included Born from a Wish, a sub-scenario which focuses on Maria before she and James meet.

Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person view and gameplay places a greater emphasis on finding items and solving riddles than combat. Psychological aspects such as the gradual disappearance of Mary's letter were added to the game. More humanoid than their counterparts in the preceding game, some of the monsters were designed as a reflection of James' subconscious.

Silent Hill 2 received critical acclaim from critics. Within the month of its release in North America, Japan, and Europe, over one million copies were sold, with the greatest sales in North America. English-language critics praised the atmosphere, graphics, story and monster designs of Silent Hill 2, but criticized the controls as difficult to use. Since its release, the game appeared on several critics' top lists for its story and use of metaphors, psychological horror and taboo topics as well as its soundtrack/sound design. It is now considered by many critics to be the greatest horror game of all-time, and is widely recognized as one of the greatest video games of all time.</desc>

		<desc>Henry Townshend is a man living in a small apartment in South Ashfield, a neighboring town of the infamous Silent Hill. On one strange night, Henry has a terrible nightmare, with recurring events: his phone is dead, his windows are sealed, and his neighbors can't hear him. He looks at his door, only to see it is blocked by several thick metal chains. A note is pinned to the door: "Don't go out!" It is signed only by a man named Walter. Henry explores his apartment, trying to figure out what is happening, when he spots a giant hole in the wall of his bathroom. Henry goes through the hole, only to find a portal which leads him to alternate dimensions. Hopefully, Henry will find out the truth about his apartment, Room 302, and live.</desc>

Each level is broken up into two sections. First, Apollo and the other mice will search for rat scouts, traveling from room to room along branching paths. Some rats will be in plain sight, but others will need you to move objects. After the rat scouts have been found, rat gangs will appear to fight you. Your companions will fight automatically, or you can order them to attack specific targets. In either case, combat is 3rd-person brawling.</desc>

		<name>Sniper Elite</name>
		<desc>Sniper Elite is a third-person action strategy game with a focus on sniping. The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are.

The single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target.</desc>

There are around 10 levels, and 12 unlockable characters, and an online mode. You can connect with three other players for a four-player online bout on Xbox Live, and as a "sort-of" team, you then proceed to smack infinite nameless thugs into polygonal paste. The game works one way: Four humans against the computer AI. You've got a punch, kick, jump, and grapple move, and when pressed multiple times, each button ignites combos. By grappling an enemy from various angles and by pressing the Dpad in different directions when executing the throw renders various satisfying hurls.</desc>

		<name>Splinter Cell Chaos Theory</name>
		<desc>Splinter Cell Chaos Theory on Xbox is an infiltration game in which you once again play as Sam Fisher. From Panama to Korea via the USA, the goal remains more or less the same, to get as close as possible to your target thanks to a wide range of moves. Hang from the ceiling and then suspend yourself above a track riddled with motion-detecting lasers. Or would you rather slip into this narrow duct?</desc>

		<desc>Third-person stealth action game, puts you in control of Sam Fisher, an ex-CIA, ex-Navy SEAL who's called into service at the request of the National Security Agency. The NSA has commissioned a new sub-agency called Third Echelon to gather intelligence in the colder, more cruel geopolitical landscape of 2004. Third Echelon has the latitude to deploy Splinter Cells -- such as Sam -- highly trained operatives who are granted the "Fifth Freedom" to do whatever it takes to protect the country. The downside is that if Sam's ever caught doing dirt, the US government will disavow any knowledge of his existence. The gadget-laden action game features 14 missions and 13 hi-tech weapons.</desc>

		<desc>In this remake of the original Spy vs. Spy, you can play a "storyline game", "modern game", "classic version" (now in 3D) or one of five "multiplayer modes" including online with three other Spies.

"Storyline game" for the single player only. Help the Black Spy sabotage the ultimate doomsday gadget. You are not alone as the White Spy and evil minions are out to stop you!

"Modern game" is for single or multi-player. Set in a modern era. Beginning from your secret hideout, journey across to the arena, mindful of traps or set your own, as you challenge the other spies to gain the four secret items (needed to complete the stage) on eight different levels. The first level is in a Robot Factory loaded with machines to moving conveyor belts. A great selection of tools: weapons - bazooka, chainsaw, flame thrower to lightening gun; mines - bear trap, banana peel or lector mine; door traps; safe traps; counters - decoys and power ups. "Classic versionâ plays as one or with three others. Like the original, get the Secret Items hidden somewhere in the numerous safes, locate the exit and board the helicopter to safety. Favorite weapons are back - bucket, time bomb to Essential first aid kit.</desc>

SSX 3 allows gamers to go anywhere gravity will take them. Players will discover a colossal mountain where they can immerse themselves in a free-roaming snow paradise. The ultimate all-mountain experience, SSX 3 features all-new events and courses, awe-inspiring tricks and a cast of cool, customisable characters. Discover the open terrain, explore its hidden crevices, and conquer its peaks.

Produced under the EA SPORTS BIG brand, the SSX 3 development team at EA Canada is adding technologies that bring to life rich natural graphics such as snow that sparkles and blows in the wind and realistic character shadowing. A new gameplay experience allows users to seamlessly ride from one awesome area to the next- entering competitions, taking on Big Challenges and discovering hidden collectibles. SSX 3 has blown out the trick component with unlimited combos and new, over-the-top tricks.

In addition to the new boarding venues, Big Challenges rewards players for completing any of the more than 100 unique challenges as they explore the mountain's vast world. Grind billboards, board press logs, even hand plant the fence line.

The musical soundtrack features a broad range of music from artists including the X-Ecutioners, Felix Da Housecat, Queens of the Stone Age, N.E.R.D., and many more.</desc>

		<desc>Gamers return to the slopes in this third full edition of EA's exaggerated-action snowboarding series, SSX. As the game goes "On Tour," players create their own custom characters, which they'll develop from amateur bunny-hillers to seasoned "Black Diamond" pros. For the first time, the game allows skiers on the mountains as well, and players can decide if they'd rather ski or board when they create their characters. Building upon a distinguishing feature of the series, SSX On Tour features long, seamlessly streaming courses, some of which may take as long as half-an-hour (of real-time) to complete. The slopes are populated with fellow boarders and skiers in this edition, providing some extra personality. Featuring more than 40 songs, the diverse rock soundtrack includes selections by Def Leppard, The Hives, Iron Maiden, Bloc Party, Jurassic 5, and several others.</desc>

As the game progresses, Jaden encounters the 'Disciples of Ragnos', a Sith cult who are stealing Force energy from various locations across the galaxy. The player learns that the cult is led by Tavion, the former apprentice of Kyle's nemesis Desann from Jedi Outcast. Tavion has recovered the Scepter of Ragnos, which has the power to drain and release Force energy. She plans to restore the Sith to power by using the stolen Force energy to resurrect an ancient Sith Lord, Marka Ragnos.</desc>
