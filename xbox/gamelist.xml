Before long Bond is yet again called into action when MI6 loses contact with 003. And so Bond is off to Peru...</desc>

		<name>187 Ride Or Die</name>
		<desc>In order to become "top dog" of the game the player must race and defeat opponents through a variety of different stages all set in Los Angeles's infamous South Central region.
The game's title comes from two phrases common in the subculture. 187 is the California Penal Code section that defines murder. It has come into general use among gangs in the United States as a synonym for murder, and this usage has passed into popular culture via gangsta rap. "Ride or die" is a combination of the phrases "ride it out" and "die trying", meaning one is willing to do anything even if it involves personal risk.
If playing with another player, one can be the driver and the other can be the shooter. This can be done in the story and online mode. There are a variety of modes available to the player.</desc>

		<name>Advent Rising</name>
		<desc>Advent Rising is a sci-fi shooter with a storyline penned by author Orson Scott Card, whose video game credits include The Dig and the Monkey Island series of adventure games. Advent Rising tells the story of a supposedly peaceful race called the Seekers. The setting takes place in a universe where planets have banded together to shape future policy and promote goodwill throughout the galaxy. It is a universe where members of an intergalactic council have appointed the Seekers as overseers in the development of new civilizations before these planets are permitted to join the esteemed council. Yet the Seekers are not as diplomatic as they seem. Another species has learned of a sinister plot by the Seekers to eliminate the human race.
 

A small band of human freedom fighters, led by a man named Gideon Wyeth, plans to stop this form of genocide at all costs. Players assume the role of Gideon while exploring the 3D worlds from a third-person perspective. Advent Rising offers a variety of weapons with which to thwart the armies of Seekers, and players will also be able to commandeer vehicles and channel special mind powers for protection as well as offense. The first of a planned trilogy of titles, Advent Rising uses Epic Games' Unreal technology to create the worlds in which players must battle. Orson Scott Card has also written a companion novel to expand upon the ideas found in the game, which can be purchased at the time of Advent Rising's release.</desc>

		<desc>Combine the many tricks and styles of the extreme sport, inline skating, with a Tony Hawk style system, complete with objectives and huge arenas, and you have Aggressive Inline.

Progress through the career mode, where you must complete objectives (such as grind a certain object(s) to jump over large gaps and gain points) to open up further arenas, which there are 7 in all, and once your bored with them, you can make your own in the park editor. The game doesn't use a hard time limit but the so-called "juice meter": it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a "learning by doing" approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level which open up new areas within the level.</desc>

		<desc>The All-Star Baseball baseball video game series was developed and published by Acclaim Entertainment. The series began in 1997 with the release of All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas, the successor to Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball. New York Yankees play-by-play announcers John Sterling and Michael Kay were the announcers for 1998-2000 editions of the game. The final release in the series (due to the bankruptcy of Acclaim) is All-Star Baseball 2005.

Within the individual games, there are several different modes of play, such as exhibition, managing an existing Major League Baseball team or creating a team. Many North American cities are available for "expansion," in addition to Mexico City and Puerto Rico.

Most of the games feature Derek Jeter on the cover.</desc>

		<desc>The 2004 installment in Acclaim's long-running baseball series. The game features more than 80 new features and improvements, including a deeper, more customizable franchise mode. The biggest change comes in the interface. You still hit the same buttons to swing, bunt, steal, and field, but the batting cursor has been visually altered. It's still the same triangle shape as before, just with a different outline. Bunting is more unique, though. Instead of aiming the cursor when you go to bunt, a large arrow points on the ground. Aim your bunt in the desired direction and hope for the best. Fielding has also received a slight change, with the ball cursor changing color. Four up to four players.</desc>

		<name>All-Star Baseball 2005</name>
		<desc>The All-Star Baseball baseball video game series was developed and published by Acclaim Entertainment. The series began in 1997 with the release of All-Star Baseball '97 Featuring Frank Thomas, the successor to Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball. New York Yankees play-by-play announcers John Sterling and Michael Kay were the announcers for 1998-2000 editions of the game. The final release in the series (due to the bankruptcy of Acclaim) is All-Star Baseball 2005.

Within the individual games, there are several different modes of play, such as exhibition, managing an existing Major League Baseball team or creating a team. Many North American cities are available for "expansion," in addition to Mexico City and Puerto Rico.

Most of the games feature Derek Jeter on the cover.</desc>

		<desc>This game is based on the Will Smith &amp; Martin Lawrence buddy cop movie sequel Bad Boys II.  You can play as either character, Mike, or Marcus, from 1st or 3rd person viewpoints. Each has their own personalities and characteristics. Through 15 stages, you engage in fast-paced all-action gameplay that features multiple mission objectives. Shoot your way through Colombian drug lords, Russian mobsters, and even dirty cops. Sometimes you will need to protect your computer-controlled partner or collect some evidence.  You can often duck behind a wall or around a corner, from where you will be able to pick off your targets with less chance of being hit. You will be accordingly rewarded on your successful actions and achievements on a "Bad Boy" rating system. You can follow all the laws and avoid unnecessary damage or take the opposite approach and be a Bad Boy. There's a good amount of different weapons from pistols and shotguns to automatic assault rifles and grenades. Environments are fully destructible. You can use a quick aiming and shooting Action mode, or search for clues and evidence using the Explore mode.</desc>

Playing as both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, Batman, you will need to hunt evil forces in familiar locations such as Arkham asylum, Gotham City, but also in the Himalaya. Using both stealth and brutal skills, you take on enemies in true beat-em-up style. Batman has a vast array of moves, from kicks and punches to more exotic special moves. Multiple enemies can be attacked at once, and there are tricks to break through enemies' defenses. Also, certain attacks can only be used as a finishing move when opponents are weakened. Next to the melee combat, Batman carries his Bat Utility Belt with a Batgrapple to reach higher areas, the Batarang and gadgets such as smoke and flash grenades, a lockpick, camera hacker and an optical wire to peek from behind corners.</desc>

		<name>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</name>
		<desc>Beyond Good &amp; Evil takes place in the year 2435 on the mining planet of Hillys, located in Sector Four, a remote section of the galaxy. The architecture of the city around which the game takes place was designed with a rustic European style. The world itself combines modern elements, such as e-mail and credit cards, with those of science fiction and fantasy, such as spaceships and anthropomorphic animals coexisting with humans. The once-peaceful planet is under siege by aliens called the DomZ that abduct beings and either drain their life force for power or implant them with spores to convert them into slaves. A military dictatorship called the Alpha Sections takes power, promising to defend the populace. However, the Alpha Sections seem unable to stop the DomZ despite their public assurances. An underground resistance movement, the IRIS Network, fights the Alpha Sections, believing them to be in league with the DomZ.</desc>

The game is different than the first as players take control of the Time Sweepers and mastering time. The Tom Tom Gang control space. However, the player does not play as Blinx. The time limit is also gone from each level. The game is more of an action game rather than a platform game. Artoon's game has expanded into non-traditional platform territories and plays more like a light-weight action game. The player has a huge arsenal of gadgets and weapons. The switch between the two teams is a new experience.</desc>

		<name>Blood Omen 2</name>
		<desc>The direct sequel to the original Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain and the fourth in the gothic series (which encompasses the Soul Reaver titles), Blood Omen 2 continues the adventures of the bloodthirsty vampire known as Kain. This third-person action-adventure takes place 400 years after the events in the first title. Killed at the hands of the Sarafan lord, Kain is resurrected and must now regain his memory as well as his powers before he can mete out his revenge.

As a vampire, Kain requires sustenance in the form of human blood. An onscreen blood meter (which doubles as Kain's health meter) drains continuously, requiring the antihero to feed on enemies or the hapless denizens populating the towns and villages in order to stay alive. Weaker enemies can be dispatched using his bare claws, while stronger enemies will be more easily defeated with the aid of clubs, axes, and long swords found along the journey. 

In addition to standard attacks, Kain is also capable of performing grab moves and stealth-kills, both of which are highlighted by a short cut-scene showing the gruesome death of his victim. Cinematic cut-scenes also introduce the game's many characters and flesh-out the plot. While Kain's blood meter starts out relatively small, it will gradually increase in size after consuming a victim's "lore" energy or by finding energy in special relics strewn about the world.

Blocking during combat increases Kain's rage meter, which upon being filled, allows him to unleash any of his combat-related Dark Gifts: special powers regained at critical junctures in his journey. Charm, for example, allows Kain to possess weak-willed citizens and force them to do his bidding, while Mist makes him invisible when surrounded by fog, allowing Kain to sneak around undetected. As more of these Dark Gifts are acquired, areas previously unreachable become accessible.

400 years have passed since the vampire Kain damned the world in the original Blood Omen, choosing to rule the world in damnation then die for it?s salvation. Now Kain, who once controlled the land of Nosgoth with his vampire armies, finds his brethren slain and his dark powers stripped by a mysterious figure. To reclaim his rule and exact his vengeance, Kain must dispatch armies of zealot soldiers and overcome legions of demons in order to uncover the ominous plot that threatens the land he seeks to conquer.</desc>

		<name>Bloody Roar : Extreme</name>
		<desc>ach character has a set of moves spread across a punch, kick, beast and block button, which is also used for throws. Special moves are primarily performed using quarter-circle or half-circle motions and a face button, though several exceptions exist. Attacks can be blocked with either a light guard, performed by not pressing forward or backward, or a heavy guard by holding back or the block button. Various attacks in the game can break through and stagger opponents using a light block. Various characters also have light block counters, which work against certain high or mid-level punches and kicks. Players start each fight with a full life bar and a Beast Gauge, which allows them to transform into a stronger half-animal fighter. This gauge fills as the player performs moves or gets attacked. It fills with either a blue bar, indicating the player cannot switch to beast form, or a yellow bar with the words "BEAST CHANGE!!" appearing above it, meaning the player can transform. While in beast form, both the life bar and the Beast Gauge deplete. An emptied life bar results in a knockout, but emptying the Beast Gauge and knocking the opponent down reverts them to human form. Also, it reverts the Beast Gauge to the blue bar, preventing them from transforming again until it is refilled.</desc>

		<desc>Breakdown is unique in that it is technically categorized as a first-person shooter, but integrates the experiences of a fighting game into the experience as well as using auto-lock-on for shooting enemies. The viewpoint never leaves the perspective of the player, and interaction with objects, reloading of guns, and the impact of hitting the floor are all seen through this first-person perspective. Unlike other first-person shooters, interaction with objects is also all done in a realistic manner in Breakdown; ammunition is picked up by looking down and grabbing it with your arm instead of walking over it, similarly doors are opened by grabbing the handle, key cards used by swiping them over a scanner, ladders by using the arms for climbing and many others. Health and energy are replenished by consuming energy bars, sodas and hamburgers, which the player must eat while remaining in first person.</desc>

		<desc>The Sleeping Dragon moves away from the 2D point-and-click concept from the earlier games and features a full 3D world, with a camera that does not rotate, but uses fixed cinematic perspectives. The player alternately controls George or Nico. Next to typical adventure gameplay such as exploration, conversations, and searching and combining items, there are also a few action sequences. The characters can duck, sneak, hang from ledges and move crates to reach higher areas. The locations visited throughout the game include The Congo, Paris, England, Czech Republic and Egypt.</desc>

		<name>Burnout 2 : Point Of Impact</name>
		<desc>Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing. Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure. Designers have built city districts and surrounding areas, and implemented the race courses throughout the streets. As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races. As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving. Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost "burnout" meter. Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to drive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way. The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!</desc>

Many of the animals you'll be after are dangerous and aggressive and will take you one-on-one - and you'll be armed with a primary weapon as well as a knife or pistol for close combat defense. You'll hunt for 27 animals in 12 regions. Animals include dangerous species such as bears, wolves, leopards, rhinos and cape buffalo; big game species such as moose, bighorn, mountain goat, elk and caribou; and exotic species such as impala, duiker and kudu. The regions include British Columbia, Colorado, New Mexico, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Game modes include Quick Hunt (one tag, one animal, one region), Action Zone (warp from location to location, where dangerous animals are waiting to attack you), and Career Hunt (a series of missions where you have some choice as to which task you'll take on next, and unlock chartered hunts).</desc>

		<desc>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2 is a hunting game focused on linear story-based gameplay, instead of the freeform hunting of the main Cabela's line. You will hunt 20 animals, including lions, tigers, and bears, across 12 main levels, and 4 hidden levels. There are three difficulty levels, and a slow-motion ability to help line up shots. Keep your eyes open; there are secret stumps in each level, which if shot can unlock extra levels and other items. In most levels, you will be assisted by a native guide, who will both draw the attention of the local wildlife, and assist you in killing them. The story features you, a world-famous hunter, who has just found out an old friend, Bullseye Bill, is missing. Retrace his steps around the world, helping other people along the way.</desc>

		<name>Call Of Duty 2 : Big Red One</name>
		<desc>In the second Call of Duty game for consoles, players again take to battle in The Second World War.  As with other Call of Duty games, the focus is on the characters and their drama amidst the furious, heavily scripted, first-person action.  As a private new to war in America's most legendary infantry division, nicknamed the Big Red One for the distinctive patch they wore, players will fight through the game as a team in the Fighting First and will be affected by the loss of friends on the battlefield.

Players will have to re-enact the successes of World War II through a wide variety of land, sea, and air missions in Africa, Sicily, and Normandy, by using vehicles including tanks, jeeps, armored cars, and half-tracks.  Success will depend on how well players can move, shoot, and complete the objectives that a commanding officer provides before each mission.

The Xbox and PS2 versions offer multiplayer games with up to 16 players.</desc>

		<desc>Colin McRae Rally and more recently; Dirt, is a racing video game series developed and published by Codemasters. Colin McRae Rally and Dirt 2 have since been developed and published for Mac OS X by Feral Interactive.

Started in 1998, the franchise has been a critical and commercial success and is generally acknowledged as a pioneer of realistic rally sports racing games. The series is named after the World Rally Championship driver Colin McRae, who provided technical advice during development.

Despite McRae's death in September 2007, Codemasters retained the use of his name on their rally games until the release of Dirt 3, where the moniker was dropped.</desc>

It features the obligatory roster updates (including the names of the players) with 325 NCAA Division I teams to choose from and improve crowd reactions, updated mascots, new fight songs and real life coaches such as Billy Donovan, Roy Williams and Jay Wright. It has the standard modes and has an updated Legacy (franchise) mode that has the player take command of a NCAA team, recruiting and training potential NBA players for the future.  It sports updated offensive and defensive A.I. and features Team Unity where the chemistry of the team combined with the captain's leadership qualities can combine to help their team in their performance and morale on the court. Players can also customize by creating their own school along with uniforms and even design a unique stadium for their created school.  The games are almost identical except for a few differences: the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions has the ability to create their own chants for their crowds to yell during home games and the PS3 utilizes the SIXAXIS controller to shoot free throws by tilting it.</desc>

		<desc>Combat Elite: WWII Paratroopers is primarily a top-down close-combat shooter with some RPG features. It can be played in single-player or two-player coop mode. The game lets the player take part as a paratrooper in the allied campaign in Europe during the second world war, starting out as a private soldier from either the US 101st Airborne, the US 82nd Airborne, or the British 1st Airborne regiment. There are 40 missions strung together with a narrative, depicting the Operation Overlord (D-Day), Bastogne, Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge and beyond - ending in an fictional effort to stop the Nazis from creating an atomic bomb. During a mission, you find medical packs, ammunition (weapon specific), and new weapons as pickups lying around, or dropped by enemies killed - the drops disappear if not picked up in time. A mission takes place on a series of relatively small maps, separated into 'levels', and at the level transition points the player can save the game, and is also awarded skill points, new ranks and medals.</desc>

		<desc>Conflict Desert Storm is a first-person/third-person shooter (the perspective can be switched by pressing a button), in which the player controls a squad of four soldiers from either the British S.A.S or American Delta Force during the first Gulf War. It has ideas borrowed from the book Bravo Two Zero and other real missions from the war. Missions are performed behind enemy lines and have specific objectives (infiltrate a base, destroy a SAM site, assassinate an opposing general, ...). Team members can be sent orders (attack, retreat, follow, stay, ...) or controlled individually. On the team is Bradley, the team leader, Conners, the heavy weapons man, Jones, the explosives and anti-tank expert, and Foley, the team sniper.  Each soldier has different skills that improve as they kill more enemies and gain experience. This results in them doing a better or faster job (Foley will have more stable aiming or Jones will plant C4 faster as their skills increase). In some missions, the player drives tanks or jeeps around while other squad members man the guns on the vehicle. At the end of each mission, the soldiers can be awarded medals for their bravery.</desc>

The Missions vary quite a bit too. Some are frenetic - fast paced where the team are fighting for their lives, others can be played at a much slower pace if desired. The level design really adds to counter-terrorism gameplay. The Team are often busting seiges using C4 to blow holes in walls and smoke grenades to flush the bad guys out.</desc>

		<desc>Conflict: Vietnam is the third game in Pivotal Games' Conflict series, this time going further back in time to the bloody battleground of Vietnam. The game is set during the Tet offensive in the year 1968. The player takes over the roles of four soldiers who aren't, contrary to previous games, elite S.A.S or Delta Force soldiers. In fact, they are normal American G.I. who are separated from their unit during battle  and have to fight themselves through enemy territory with hordes of hostile Vietnamese. Game can be played by issuing orders to every member of the squad or directly taking control over one of them. In every mission, there are one or more main and several bonus objectives, like destroying all tanks in the area or collecting Vietcong documents. For each achieved objective, killed soldier or destroyed vehicle, squad members get experience points. Each one of them has different abilities (Sniper, Leader, Heavy Weapons, Medic) which can be improved with these points. To defuse one of the numerous booby traps, it is necessary to have skills in that ability.</desc>

		<name>Constantine</name>
		<desc>The game is played in third person perspective, switching to first person when the hero enters narrow spaces. Constantine's goal is to discover how and why Demons have managed to physically enter Earth, although the ancient laws forbid it. He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch's Curse) that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell, which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or stretched out to allow for more action.</desc>

		<name>Dai Senryaku VII : Modern Military Tactics</name>
		<desc>Dai Senryaku VII: Modern Military Tactics is a Turn Based Strategy game (TBS). The game has a generic story line, in that the player is not referred to as a specific country, but as a color in Mission Mode. The game allows the player to fight over several different maps with different objectives choosing from several hundred units. The title is multiplayer, up to 4 people and has a map editor. The player can build, disband, and join units, and save units that have gained experience at the end of battle. Everything from submarines, numerous aircraft, naval ships, apc's, and infantry are available to the player for use in the game. In Free Play mode, the player can choose between several countries, including the USA, Israel, Germany, China, Japan, and more. The player can only create units during a game that are associated with that specific country. In addition to keeping track of the fuel supply, the player must also gain funds by taking over cities to support the army, as well as supply the vehicles with weapons and fuel. The game also has well over 70 maps to play and some that are based on real world situations.</desc>

Dark Angel has you playing as Max Guevera, a 'genetically engineered super-soldier' running around in a post-apocalyptic Seattle, looking to uncover past, family and the evil plans of the "- I - Corporation". Most of the game involves beat-'em-up style hand-to-hand combat. Max can pull off a variety of flashy moves such as roundhouse kicks and backflipping off walls. The camera also enters the 'bullet time' mode when she does a combo sometimes. Certain levels ask you to assume use of the few stealth skills that Max has to offer.

		<desc>Darkwatch is a first-person shooter set in the Wild West with supernatural beings. Fight your way through reapers, undead riflemen, banshees and other creatures using Darkwatch weaponry that doubles as melee weapons, such as a revolver, two-fisted pistols, a crossbow (with dynamite attached to the bolts) and a Rail Rocket. You will also find dynamite along the way to throw at the enemy and to destroy barricades. Along with conventional weapons, Cross will acquire vampire powers of good or evil nature that you must choose in the story. If you decide to be good, then you receive powers such as Silver Bullet that increases your shots with holy fire or Vindicator that calls down chain lightning on your enemies. If you choose to be evil, you will receive Blood Frenzy that makes melee attacks supernaturally powerful and Soul Stealer, which sucks the very souls from distant enemies. Regardless of good or evil, you will always have Blood Shield (protection from losing health), Vampire Jump (for those hard to reach areas) and Blood Vision (causes enemies, weapons and other important objects to glow). With every creature killed, there will be at least one Blood Cloud and sometimes more to replenish your health and restore your Vampire Powers.</desc>

		<desc>The game is somewhat unusual in that between levels, the player plays poker for extra health and ammunition. The character is armed with 4 default weapons; a knife, a pistol, a rifle and a shotgun. Other weapons that can be found are TNT and Whisky bombs. The player can shoot objects such as whisky bottles, cans and enemies to score legend points, thus filling up the "trick shot" meter that lets the character use the secondary mode of firing which varies depending on the current weapon. The combat in the game also makes use of the game's physics engine, with the player being able to trigger physics based traps such as shooting a rock and causing it to fall onto an enemy below - kills obtained this way are rewarded with extra points and a greater increase in the "trick shot" meter. Dead Man's Hand is noteworthy for featuring a protagonist of Hispanic (or Mestizo) descent.</desc>

		<desc>Dino Crisis 3 is the third game in the Dino Crisis series, and this time, it's futuristic.

The year is 2548. The colonist spaceship Ozmandias, which disappeared over 300 years ago, suddenly reappears, with no warning or reason to it's disappearance. Attempting to contact the ship results in nothing. The Interstellar Fleet Commander sends out the Special Operations and Reconnaissance (SOAR) squadron to investigate. Their shuttle is destroyed by a merciless and unknown assailant. Everyone manages to survive, and reach the ship intact. What they encounter is something they never would've thought of.

As Patrick, the leader of SOAR, you are tasked with exploring the ship, putting the pieces together, and rescuing any survivors you can find. The ship you are on, the Ozymandias, is a dynamically changing structure, which enables you to move hallways and re-position doors so that you can access new areas all the time.</desc>

		<name>Dynasty Warriors 3</name>
		<desc>About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.

They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.

Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.

Most completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, even those that never appear in Dynasty Warriors 3.</desc>

		<desc>Egg Mania is a puzzle game in which the player controls an egg-shaped character against either a computer opponent or another player via the link cable. The object of the main modes is to build a tower tall enough to reach a balloon at the top of the playfield before the opponent does. If the player tries to take a short cut and not build complete floors, the structure will start crumbling and the water will come up faster. There are plenty of obstacles, both from the game and from competing opponents. Falling meteors can knock the player down into the water, while bombs thrown by the opponent will destroy parts of the player's structure. The main modes include Over Easy and Hard Boiled, the difference being that in the latter a different difficulty can be chosen.</desc>

To start off, the ESPN presentation has been greatly expanded. Chris Berman, who did voiceover for the half-time show in 2K4, returns for this season. Instead of just voice, there is a virtual Chris Berman, who does an introduction to each game, a half-time report, and a post-game show. To illiustrate certain points, he uses replays from each game. Every move you pull off of every quarter of every game is saved and used in these replays (Xbox only). Suzy Kobler gives reports from the sideline.</desc>

This NFL adaptation boasts a comprehensive franchise mode that introduces some innovations in this standard mode. One of these is a draft ticker, which puts your team on the clock each time it selects a player in the draft. With the draft ticker on, it is important to scout college players beforehand and analyze draft positions and team needs in order to preselect your team's draft candidates. In simulated games, NFL Primetime gives a variety of coach options. Here you can customize your team's aggressiveness level in offense and blitz tendencies and even set spies on more mobile quarterbacks for simulated games. Naturally, there are also obvious franchise mode options such as the ability to draft, trade, and sign/release free agents over multiple seasons.</desc>

		<desc>ESPN NHL 2K5 is the second hockey game using Sega's partnership with the worldwide leader in sports, ESPN.

As with any sports game, you get the standard game modes. 2K5 has a vastly improved Franchise mode over last year's game. In addition to the e-mail system that was introduced, you have the ability to hire several coaches. You can choose a head coach, offensive coach, defense coach, scouting coach, a goaltending coach and more. When it comes time to hire and fire players, you use actual money, and not points to negotiate contracts.</desc>

		<desc>Fight Club is based on David Fincher's film adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. Fed up with consumerist American culture, a fight club is founded as a new type of therapy through bare-knuckle fighting. The game focuses on the fights and uses many characters and environments from the original story. You can create a new fighter or clone one of the generated characters. There are three general fighting styles to choose from: grappling, kung fu or brawling. The moves range from basic punches to devastating moves with broken bones, ripped clothes and real-time facial deformation. After each successful fight, you earn Character Development Points (CDP's) which can be used to upgrade or heal your character.</desc>

		<name>Fight Night 2004</name>
		<desc>Fight Night is EA Sports' new boxing series, replacing the previous Knockout Kings line of games.

You have the option of creating your own personalized boxer, and entering a career mode, where you start off on the lowest rung in dirty, rundown gyms, as you make your way up the ropes to become the undisputed champion. Throughout your career you will have to battle many enemies, all vying for the same title. As you play, you will be able to train, improving your boxer's stats. You can hit a punching bag to increase power and speed, spar with an opponent for more stamina and agility, attack the dummy to improve chin and body, or hit the mitts to improve heart and cut. Besides career mode, you have access to the standard modes.

Fight Night 2004 features the "Total Control" system, which utilizes both sticks to give you complete percision over your boxer's moves. The right analog stick controls all the punching, and the left stick controls movement and defense/blocks.

There are several unlockables available, all of which must be earned through career mode. You can buy new clothes, entrance music, even new girls to accompany you to the ring.

The PlayStation 2 version of Fight Night 2004 supports online play via EA Sports' online network.

As with all other EA Sports titles, Fight Night 2004 utilizes the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your progress through all EA Sports games. The more games you play, the longer you play them, and the better you do translates into a higher Gamer Level. When you reach certain levels, you can unlock special rewards.</desc>

Each character has a different level of ability (for example, one may be highly accurate in cornering but slow, while another is much faster but less responsive in turning).Apart from the usual race modes, you can also take on a 4 player race (split-screen only).</desc>

		<desc>The Soviet Union has invaded New York City! Chris Stone is just a plumber, and he's willing to live out his life normally even after the occupation... Until the Soviets picked up his brother Troy and charged him of being a terrorist (i.e. freedom fighter). Now Chris must contact the REAL freedom fighters, get his brother out, and eventually, drive the invaders out of New York!

Freedom Fighters is a 3rd person shooter with squad-based tactics, with a variety of typical weapons such as pistol, revolver, assault rifle, sub machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher, grenade, and so on. As you proceed further in the game, you can control more and more people in your squad, until you end up with up to a dozen different freedom fighters all fighting alongside you in your quest to drive out the invaders.</desc>

You play four on four in five game modes: Turf War, Home Turf, Street Challenge Cup, Exhibition and Multiplayer. The first requires you to conquer neighborhoods in the city by winning soccer matches against rival gangs. Street Challenge Cup allows you to play an entire competition. Each player can perform a large variety of moves beyond the typical soccer game moves, such as scissor kicks, midair juggles, and bicycle kicks. Performing said moves allows you to gain skill points that can be used to unlock new game modes, teams, courts, and cheats. Next to these special moves, you can also interact with the environment. Your players can pick things up and throw them around or manually hit your opponents.</desc>

		<name>Full Spectrum Warrior</name>
		<desc>In Full Spectrum Warrior, you take on the role of commander of two squads of the United States military, Alpha and Bravo, as you guide them in the fictional country of Zekistan on a mission to capture or kill the terrorist Al Afad.

 In the game, you don't directly control your troops. You don't take aim at a target and shoot, and you don't circle-strafe around enemies. Instead, you tell your squad what to do, and they'll do it. It's like a real-time strategy game. You can tell your two squads to do numerous things, such as hide behind a wall, take cover behind a car, lob a grenade, fire off a rocket, or attack a target. You will need to utilize both squads to be successful. For example, you can have Alpha squad hide behind a car and lay down covering fire at a target that you can't directly kill, giving Bravo squad cover so they may cross open terrain, and get into a position where they will be able to kill the enemy.

 The game takes place in one locations, a Middle Eastern country, that's split up into several areas. You'll have to make your way through parks, an airport, city streets, and even some buildings. Throughout the country are many terrorists, all of whom are trying to kill you. You have four members on each squad; the Team Leader, Automatic Rifleman, Grenadier and Rifleman. Each plays a unique role.

 Full Spectrum Warrior supports Xbox Live, where two players can play through the single player campaign. Instead of controlling both squads, one player controls Alpha while the other controls Bravo.</desc>

		<desc>Onimusha: Warlords, released in Japan as Onimusha (?), is the first action-adventure video game of the Onimusha series, released first for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. Later it was released in an updated form as Genma Onimusha ( ?) for the Xbox in 2002. The original Onimusha: Warlords version was also ported to Microsoft Windows, although this version was only released in Asia and Russia.

The game's plot is set in the Sengoku period and focuses on the samurai Samanosuke Akechi who fights against the forces of Nobunaga Oda. After Nobunaga's death in battle, Samanosuke goes on a quest to save Princess Yuki from demons working alongside Nobunaga's forces. The player controls Samanosuke and his partner, a female ninja Kaede, in their fight against demons.

While the game borrows elements from Capcom's own Resident Evil survival horror series, such as solving puzzles and a fixed camera, the game is focused more on the action genre with Samanosuke possessing multiple weapons that can be upgraded by defeating several enemies. Capcom originally wanted to release the game for the original PlayStation but the close release of its next generation version resulting in the project being scrapped.

Following its release, Onimusha: Warlords achieved high popularity becoming the first PlayStation 2 game to reach the one million sales. Its sales eventually surpassed the two million units worldwide. The game has been well received by video game publications and has been recognized as one of the best titles on the system. It also spanned two direct sequels for the same console and another three games within the franchise.</desc>

		<desc>Grooverider is a slot-car inspired arcade racer aimed at the budget/casual market.  In this game, you race against three other cars around a track inside different rooms of a luxury apartment.  

There are three different difficulties, or voltages, each faster than the last. There is a selection of cars to race in: British classics, 70's cop show, stock cars, GT sports, Formula X and Japanese.

Although the racing is limited to fixed lanes that you switch between there are also roadblocks, ramps, splits, loops, merges, and power-ups along the track, and you can barge other cars off.

The game has both single-player and two-player split-screen modes, and some extra game modes such as cops-n-robbers, and time trial with ghost car.</desc>

		<desc>Group S Challenge is a racing game somewhere between arcade and simulation: the game focuses on delivering a realistic driving experience, e.g. with physics modeled after real life, but features simple controls.nnnnGameplay itself features the usual playing modes: splitscreen-duels against another player, time races and an arcade mode with instant races against the AI. The most important mode however is the Circuit Mode which is basically a career: the player starts with a few credits and tries to become the most successful driver. There are five leagues which want to be won. Of course the player receives prize money after accomplishments which is reinvested into upgrade his car or buying a new one altogether. Besides the races there are two additional ways to receive rewards: Line-In races (following the shown ideal line) for money and Head-to-Head races against a single opponent for a new car.nn</desc>

		<name>Ice Age 2 : The Meltdown</name>
		<desc>Ice Age 2: The Meltdown is loosely based on the movie of the same name. The game takes place in prehistory - you play as Scrat, the hapless (but not totally helpless!) proto-squirrel, helping your friends escape the coming of a huge flood. The WASD keys move you forward and back, left and right, and the mouse controls camera movement and some actions. Scrat has a few special moves as well, such as sniff, his spin attack, a double jump, a ground stomp (useful for breaking ice), and a roll attack. Much of the game consists of hunting down acorns and other special nuts for health renewal or for unlocking bonuses. There are a few mini-games within the game - you can play as Sid, zipping along an ice slide while avoiding obstacles; there's also penguin-bowling and a mini-game where you "shoot" at monkeys to regain a walnut that was whisked out from under your nose.</desc>

		<desc>A follow up to the Dreamcast title Jet Grind Radio. The setting is Tokyo in the year 2024. Freedom is a valuable commodity and freedom of expression even more so. Gangs of misbehaving teens strap on rocket-powered roller blades and skate, grind, and mark their territory with graffiti tags. Players take the role of the GGs, and can choose between any member of the gang, each with different stats, while in gang HQ. The city of Tokyo can be leisurely explored without a time limit, but the heat will be turned up when story missions are activated and the GGs find themselves being challenged by rival gangs or under attack from the cops. This time around spraying no longer requires thumbstick inputs; just roll up and start spraying away, although large tags still require more cans than smaller tags. Each section of the city has hidden objectives that are revealed by finding a hidden tape, and once completed these challenges will unlock new graffiti patterns.</desc>

		<name>Jurassic Park : Operation Genesis</name>
		<desc>Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis puts you in the shoes of a Dr. Hammond-type scientist, and challenges you to build a dinosaur themed amusement park. You have various buildings at your disposal, from the standard restaurant and bathroom to gift stalls and photo booths. You can opt to construct a safari tour, like what took place in the first movie.  You even have the ability to take the tour yourself, and see your park as your visitors see it. One of the most important objects is the Ranger Station.  With this building, you can have helicopters patrol your park to watch for any disasters.  If a dino should escape, you have the option of entering the helicopter in a first person view to try to shoot the dino with a tranquilizer dart.  If you want to stick to building only, you can let the AI capture the dino.</desc>

		<name>Just Cause</name>
		<desc>You are Rico Rodriguez, a CIA-agent who is sent to the small Island of San Esperito to start a revolution and bring down the current regime under the rule of General Salvador Mendoza. After you jumped out of the airplane and helped your local contact survive an attack by gang members, you have - much like GTA: San Andreas - the freedom to do what you want. The complete island is accessible from the beginning and you can either follow the main storyline, engage in side-missions, or collect items all over the place. To help the revolution you can also drive the government out of the individual sectors on the island. This is accomplished by a three-stages fight in which you have to go up against a huge army of government forces.</desc>

There are twelve fighters to choose from, each with their own fighting style, such as Jeet Kune Do, Kickboxing, Wrestling, etc.  Each fighter also has his or her own special moves, which are more powerful than the basic moves. KC is un-scripted, meaning every hit, jab, kick, punch, etc. will be executed in real-time, meaning a kick to the head won't always produce the same falling animation. The game modes available are Tournament, 2 Player and 4 Player Battle Royal</desc>

		<desc>Karaoke Revolution allows gamers to show off their singing skills and get real-time feedback on their performances.  It's similar to Dance Dance Revolution, but with singing instead of dancing. The game rates the player's performance based on their vocal pitch and timing. A visual indicator shows the player's current pitch in real time and also the pitch of vocals of the original song. If the original notes of the song are too high for the player's vocal range, the game allows the player to sing at higher or lower octaves to hit the correct notes. If the player sings well, the crowd gets into the performance by clapping, cheering and dancing. If the performance is bad, the audience becomes bored and the user can get booed off the stage. Players can unlock extra characters, additional outfits, more songs, and behind the scenes videos.</desc>

After having Raziel killed to be revived by the Elder God as a wraith during the events of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Kain travels backwards through time and is followed by Raziel into Nosgoth's past, uncovering the conspiratorial events that led to the land being doomed to an eternity of corruption. After establishing his free will by refusing to kill Kain when prophesied, Raziel discovers that Moebius the Timestreamer had originally manipulated Kain into igniting a genocidal war against Vampires until he was the last of his kind. In manipulating Raziel who has free will and thus whose decisions and actions cannot be foreseen by Moebius, Kain hopes to find a way to undo the consequences of his actions and restore Nosgoth to its former glory.</desc>

		<desc>Be a part of Dreamwork's animated adventure by guiding Marty the Zebra, Alex the lion, Melman the giraffe, Gloria the hippo and those stealthy Penguins as they escape the Central Park Zoo into the streets of New York and then into the wild jungle...err San Diego zoo.

The storyline is exactly the same as the movie itself and each chapter will bring you further in the story. Every chapter will have various goals set. Only one specific goal per chapter is required to complete the chapter so you can always replay the chapter later to try to complete all the goals. 

Every stage will also require you to play as a different character and some will involve all characters. 

Each character have their own unique abilities: Marty can kick with his hind legs, sneak around his enemies slide and perform long-jumps. Alex the lion can throw fruits, use his claws and roar at his enemies. Gloria can tumble, butt bounce and hip check her enemies. And when she eats some chili peppers, she will be able to charge into her enemies. Melman can spin into, throw items at and head bash his enemies. He can also perform the Helicopter move which enables him to glide long distances. Finally the Penguin can slide, fish and attack with a Finishing move (something like a karate chop) to defeat their enemies.

Throughout the game there will be various items to collect including Life Tikis to replenish your Health Meter and Monkey Money that will enable you to buy special things at the Zoovenir Shop like mini games and special outfits for the Madagascar cast.</desc>

		<name>Max Payne</name>
		<desc>The story is told in medias res and consists of three volumes: "The American Dream", "A Cold Day in Hell", and "A Bit Closer to Heaven". The game begins in the winter of 2001, as New York City finishes experiencing the worst blizzard in the history of the city. The intro sequence shows Max Payne, a renegade DEA agent and former NYPD officer, standing at the top of a skyscraper building as police units arrive. He then experiences a flashback from three years ago. Back in 1998, Max returned home to find that a trio of apparent junkies had broken into his house while high on a new designer drug called Valkyr. Max rushed to the aid his family, but was too late and his wife and their newborn daughter had already been brutally murdered. After his family's funeral, Payne transferred to the DEA. Three years later, Max Payne is employed as an undercover operative inside the Punchinello Mafia family responsible for the trafficking of Valkyr. His DEA colleague B.B. gives Max a message asking him to meet another DEA agent, who is also Max's best friend, Alex Balder, in the NYC Subway station. Max's arrival at the subway results in a shoot-out after he encounters mobsters working for Jack Lupino, a Mafia underboss in the Punchinello crime family, attempting a bank robbery by breaking through from the station. Working his way back to the surface, Max encounters Alex, who is then killed by an unknown assassin and Payne becomes the prime suspect in the murder. Additionally, the Mafia find out that he is a cop and now want him dead.</desc>

		<desc>Arthurian legend comes alive as players take the role of Memorick, the young sword-wielding apprentice of Merlin. To Merlin's dismay, Memorick's interests were more vested in justice, honor, and knighthood than magical spells and wizardry. As Memorick players will defend his native land against the armies of Morganna, half-sister to King Arthur, and her son, Mordred.

The game features 19 levels to explore and a total of 26 monsters controlled by an AI system designed to offer real-time character animations combined with 3D environments and graphics. Four gameplay modes include flying a gryphon, riding a horse, sliding down on a shield, and walking/running as players try to vanquish the evil that shadows the land.</desc>

		<desc>The creators of the original Medal of Honor take you back to explore the time of the Vietnam war. Playing as marine Dean Shepard, you travel through lush terrains and exotic landscapes to lead your AI controlled squad through jungles, tunnels and hooches while battling the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong. To recreate a cinematic feel, the gameplay uses many scripted events and licensed sixties music.

If the single player campaign doesnât send you home in a body bag, you can mow down some friends in the fierce multiplayer action. Play both sides using weapons of their era, from M60s to RPDs in multiplayer class-based game types such as Search and Destroy, Recover the Documents, Frontline and the traditional DeathMatch.</desc>

		<name>Minority Report</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name.  You play John Anderton, the head of Pre-Crime.  The game is a third person fighting/adventure game.  You fight your way through Pre-crime cops and change your identity in an attempt to clear your name of pre-murder charges.

The game involves both hand-to-hand combat, the use of weapons and flying a jet pack. When fighting an opponent hand-to-hand there are multiple punch and kick combinations that can be used, these have greater effect on the opponent rendering them senseless quicker. Unconscious opponents can be picked up and then either hit some more or thrown. 

Around the levels there are power-ups to collect such as health and cash, the health is used immediately to restore the player's character while the cash is used on the black market, accessed via the pause menu, to purchase new combat manoeuvres; permanent upgrades; temporary upgrades or weapons.</desc>

		<desc>MLB SlugFest 20-03 offers exaggerated, supercharged baseball action. Featuring real Major League Baseball players, teams, and stadiums, the game puts the emphasis on adrenaline and over-the-top plays. Enormous muscle-bound players take the field and perform incredible defensive plays, including acrobatic diving catches and turbo-powered throws. While at the plate, gamers can dig in and unleash mammoth blasts clear out of the park. The animations are detailed to the point where you can view players on the field chewing gum, talking to one another, and cheering for their teammates. The game sets the tone with an original baseball anthem, "Riot at the Bat Rack," performed by the heavy metal group Dry Kill Logic.</desc>

The AI of the players' hold true to the players' appearance in the game and in real life. Larger players will move more slowly and fatigue quicker than smaller players. So if you pull a jump shot on a shorter player you don't have to worry about poor AI allowing the shorter player a 5 foot vertical leap to block your shot. The AI is honest and accurate.</desc>

Take control of a full coaching career from inception at a small time college working your way up to a major powerhouse performer.  You can also play a skirmish with a friend, go out for a two-on-two game, or one of many other play modes you would expect in a competitive basketball game.  Just don't play it like the NBA... the college game has a different, more team-oriented feel, and this comes through in the gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>NCAA Football 08 is a college football video game created by EA Sports, the sports video gaming subsidiary of Electronic Arts. It is the successor to NCAA Football 07 in the NCAA Football series. It was officially announced with the launch of the NCAA 08 page on the EA Sports website on February 20, 2007. EA Sports had opened up a ballot on their NCAA Football 07 site in which fans can vote on a feature to be implemented into the PlayStation 2 version, making it the first console announced for the game and announcing at least one of its features. Fans could vote for either in-game saves, medical red shirts, summer workouts or a lead blocker feature. The option of medical red shirts was voted on and won, and this option is on the Dynasty Mode on all versions of NCAA Football 08. This allows for players that are injured in the middle of the year to apply to gain another year of eligibility. The game was released on July 17, 2007, and the first time release on PlayStation 3, marking the eleventh installment of the NCAA Football series bearing the title "NCAA Football". As with NCAA Football 07, 08 features limited ESPN integration.</desc>

		<desc>NHL 2005 features Open Ice Control, which according to EA allows better control, including moving players without the puck and also a complete World Cup mode where each team can be created from scratch. For the first time, the user was allowed to import digitized home arenas for the scratchbuilt teams (the 30 NHL arenas plus Nuremberg Arena, KÃ¶lnarena, Stockholm Globe Arena, Helsinki Hartwall Areena and Prague Sazka Arena were available). Additional NHL jerseys and logos were also available including those of the defunct Atlanta Flames, Winnipeg Jets, Colorado Rockies (NHL), Quebec Nordiques as well as the old style Los Angeles Kings, Washington Capitals and Vancouver Canucks uniforms of the 1970s and the 1980s.

The IIHF license which granted the World Cup mode also allowed EA to use real-life international jerseys for the only time (previously released games used unique jerseys designed by the game's staff which only bore a passing similarity to their real life counterparts, so the jersey shows their flag.) The PC version of the game was stripped down to the bare essentials, including the omitting of the create-a-player feature. These omissions were possibly due to the labour dispute that season, but EA explained that they hadn't perfected the new create-a-player interface, which would have allowed for far greater customizability than what was previously available.</desc>

In keeping with his ninja persona, his character can interact with the game environment to perform acrobatic feats, such as running along and jumping off walls, swinging from pole to pole, or running across water.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Gaiden Black</name>
		<desc>Ninja Gaiden Black and Ninja Gaiden Sigma. The game follows the fictional story of Ryu Hayabusa, a master ninja, in his quest to recover a stolen sword and avenge the slaughter of his clan.

Tecmo specifically targeted Ninja Gaiden at a non-Japanese audience, and despite difficulties in obtaining content ratings due to the game's graphic depictions of violence, it was generally well received, and 362,441 copies were sold in North America in the first month after its release. Nevertheless, the game had to be censored for release in some regions, and Japanese sales were poor, with only 60,000 in the four months following its release. Making use of the Xbox's internet connectivity, Ninja Gaiden was the focus of a series of online contests across North America, Europe and Japan. Record-breaking numbers of players took part, competing for places in the live final, which was held during the Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2004.

Team Ninja continued to update the game after its release: two Hurricane Packs were made available as free downloadable content that added extra content, gameplay challenges, and game engine improvements.[1] These were incorporated into a reworked version, released in 2005 and entitled Ninja Gaiden Black, that was regarded by the game's creator Tomonobu Itagaki and many players as the definitive version. In 2007, Ninja Gaiden was graphically enhanced on the PlayStation 3, with extra content, in the form of Ninja Gaiden Sigma. This version was later released on the PlayStation Vita as Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus.</desc>

		<desc>Something is very wrong at Leafmore High. The entire school has turned dark and foreboding, strange sounds echo in the halls, and several people have mysteriously gone missing. One group of brave teens decides to find out what's going on... no matter what. They have no idea what kind of horrors have gripped the school and everyone in it. In the darkness, the evil has power... but add light and they can be defeated. Will they survive the night ahead?

In Solo Mode, choose from 5 characters with different personalities, aptitude and perspectives. Change between them at any time (as long as they are still alive).

The player can also select a second person (as a "teammate") to accompany the player by going to a "gathering point" in the game. At any time during play, the player can switch control between the first character and the second, thereby accessing their special talents.

There are several basic types of weapons used in the game: contact (a baseball bat for instance), pistols, guns, and more exotic, high-powered "special" weapons. Ammunition is specific for each gun or pistol and is not interchangeable. Weapons can be swapped between characters and ammunition found is stored in the group's reserves for sharing amongst them.</desc>

		<name>Oddworld : Munch's Oddysee</name>
		<desc>Munch is a lonely Gabbit - a gentle frog-like creature who communicates with other members of its species through echolocation. Munch searches in vain for others of his kind: his entire race has been exterminated, since the Gabbit eggs ("gabbiar") is a delicacy, and their lungs have been used by the chain-smoking, powerful Glukkons to replace their own. The last of the Gabbits is captures by two Vykkers, owners of Vykkers Labs, where they conduct experiments on living creatures. The two implant a sonar device in Munch's head, concocting a plan to enslave him and use him to trap other animals. However, Munch discovers that the implant has given him new powers; using those, he begins to free the vicious Fuzzles, whom the Vykkers have been using in their laboratories, hoping to escape himself and help other creatures who suffer under the yoke of the Glukkons. Munch's Oddysee is set in the fictional Oddworld universe; its events take place after those of Abe's Exoddus. The player controls Munch as well as Abe, the hero of the previous Oddworld games. Abe's abilities haven't changed much since the last installment: as before, GameSpeak must be used to communicate with other creatures, leading them to safety. His fellow Mudokons can now be ordered to attack enemies. Abe can also grab and toss Mudokons or Munch to lead them to area they cannot access otherwise. Possessing enemies also comes into play, and is needed to solve many of the puzzles. Possession abilities can now be used to ignite quarrels between enemies and make them fight each other.</desc>

		<desc>A bounty hunter known only as the Stranger is pursuing and capturing various criminals, trying to earn enough money for a mysterious operation. When he hears that a town populated by Grubbs has been invaded by a demon, the Stranger ventures there. The town was once protected by a race of creatures known as the Steef, who now appear to be completely extinct. The Stranger soon discovers that a nearby river has been dried up by a dam, built by a person called Sekto. The Stranger must confront this person as he continues to hunt down outlaws, revealing nothing about his past. Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is set in the fictional Oddworld universe, differing in many ways from the preceding installment. The game incorporates two basic genres: third-person platforming action and first-person shooter. The player can switch between the modes at any time by using a melee or a ranged weapon, respectively. The goal of the game, for the most part, is to bag the outlaws and bring them in, collecting "moolah" (the game's currency) in the process. The Stranger can stun or knock down enemies, as well as use a stealthy approach, e.g. hiding in long grass to surprise the enemy.</desc>

The player controls the main character in the forest and uses the different forest creatures to resolve simple puzzles (considering the target age for the game) by throwing them.

		<name>Otogi 2 : Immortal Warriors</name>
		<desc>Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors combines fantasy with real life folklore and fast paced action. It starts where its predecessor ended and this time Raikoh, the hero of the first game, is not alone. Five new warriors join him and combine their powers to tackle the task of saving the world from a new demonic threat. Gameplay is pretty much your regular hack &amp; slash, and there is lots of it. The player advances through levels, destroying huge amounts of mystical enemies with different attacks, both physical and magical,  while collecting experience which lets one improve the skills of the characters. New weapons and accessories can be purchased from a store between levels. Challenge levels separate from the main game open up as levels are completed, such as ones that task you wish surviving against a never ending horde of monsters, or destroying 100 arches in a limited time. Almost everything in the game's levels are destroyable, from trees to buildings, and the six playable characters are all different so one level might be easier to complete with one character than the other.</desc>

		<name>Outlaw Volleyball</name>
		<desc>Outlaw Volleyball is the second game in Simon &amp; Schuster's growing Outlaw franchise. As the title suggests, you play various games of volleyball with shady and dirty characters, from a slutty biker to an ex con to a pair of strippers.  There are sixteen players in total.  Each character has his or her own unique personality, strengths and weaknesses. There are four different modes you can compete in; Exhibition, which is a standard volleyball game, Tour, which is the career mode that spans fifty different events, and Drills, which are sort of like practice games that awards points you can use to improve your player's abilities.  The fourth mode is Xbox Live enabled, allowing you to play with people over the Xbox Live service. There are ten different courts to play on, each one with it's own backgrounds and animation.  You can play on a beach, at a carnival, or even in a prison. Outlaw Volleyball utilizes the same momentum feature first seen in Outlaw Golf, which allows you to earn "beating tokens" that you can spend on beating up the other team.  If you are doing lousy, beating up a member of the other team refills your momentum meter, allowing you to come back and possibly win.</desc>

In response to this, the great Wizard Pac created a potion that turned 5 ordinary fruit into the "Golden Fruit." A young knight called Sir Pac-alot fought and sealed Spooky underneath a large tree using the Golden Fruit, which were attached to the branches of the tree. In the present time late at night, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde sneak into the village and, in their mischief, pick the Golden Fruit off the tree in the center of town. Unfortunately, this has released Spooky from his prison. Spooky tells the ghosts to take the Golden Fruit and follow him if they wish to rid the land of the Pac-people forever. When Pac-Man awakes, he hears the news from Professor Pac about the Golden Fruit and Spooky, and sets off to defeat the ghosts and Spooky.</desc>

		<desc>The fourth installment of the Panzer Dragoon series has you playing Orta, a young girl who has been imprisoned by the Empire. Under a wave of attack, the prison camp is broken through by a mysterious dragon, and Orta takes it upon herself to ride the dragon, and destroy the Empire once and for all. Along the way, she will also discover her own destiny, and the mystery surrounding her new friend.

Simply put, you have limited control of the dragon for most of the game, as your trigger finger will be shooting non-stop at the enemies that fly around the area. Orta will be your main source of fire-power when you simply press the fire button, but by pressing and holding, the aim cursor will change, allowing you to fire a burst of power from the dragon at whatever the cursor aims at.

The dragon itself can change into three forms at a press of a button. Each form has a different style of attack and power ability.

A port of the original Panzer Dragoon is included.</desc>

After choosing the club and the feet position the player needs to use both analog sticks. With the left one he simulates the swing and with the right one he relocates his body weight. It is not enough to relocate it simply in the right direction, the player needs to achieve a constant back and forth movement.</desc>

		<name>Psychonauts</name>
		<desc>The story is set in Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, a remote US government training facility under the guise of a children's summer camp. The area was hit centuries ago by a meteor made of psitanium (a fictional element that can grant psychic powers or strengthen existing powers), creating a huge crater. The psitanium affected the local wildlife, giving them limited psychic powers, such as bears with the ability to attack with telekinetic claws and cougars with pyrokinesis. The Native Americans of the area called psitanium "whispering rock", which they used to build arrowheads. When settlers began inhabiting the region, the psychoactive properties of the meteor slowly drove them insane. An asylum was built to house the afflicted, but within fifteen years the asylum had more residents than the town did. The government relocated the remaining inhabitants and flooded the crater to prevent further settlement, creating what is now Lake Oblongata. The asylum still stands but has fallen into disrepair.</desc>

		<desc>Pump It Up: Exceed is a dancing game similar to the games in the Dance Dance Revolution series. The Pump It Up dance mat is different from the norm as the arrows are set on diagonals and includes a button in the middle which allows for more complexity in the dance moves that are required to be performed in the game.

The general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the Pump It Up dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends.</desc>

30 missions are on offer with various objectives (destroy other cars, kill citizens and build alliances with other clans), with your ultimate goal being the leader of the gang that everyone fears.
Weapons and upgrades keep your car ahead of the pack, but to do so you need to search out the parts. Scavenger hunts for blueprints is the only way to do so, building the ultimate weapons while improving the speed and reliability of your machine.</desc>

		<name>Robocop</name>
		<desc>RoboCop(titled RoboCop: Aratanaru Kiki in Japan) is a 2003 first person shooter released for the sixth generation home consoles. The only North American version available was released for the Xbox while the PAL region versions were released on all consoles except for Game Boy Advance.[18] A Japan-only version was released on GameCube. This was the last game Titus Software developed before going bankrupt in 2005.

The game allows the player to play as RoboCop and to uncover a sinister plot involving OCP, local gangsters dealing a deadly new synthetic drug and a powerful cyborg known only as MIND. As a last hope, RoboCop must capture, destroy, or arrest hostile characters in a desperate search for clues and evidence.

The game received mostly negative reviews by critics. GameSpot rated it 2.2/10, the official Xbox Magazine UK rated it a mediocre 5.9/10, GamerFeed gave it a 2/5, Xbox Magazine gave 2/10, and NTSC UK rated it 3/10.[19] The Scandinavian magazine Gamereactor gave the game 1/10[20] and called it "the worst videogame since Superman 64" (also from Titus Software).</desc>

Her goal and the player's is to stop the terrorist group known as Omega 19, the same organization that ruthlessly stole her husband and child away from her after a bomb explosion. Now on a quest for vengeance, Connors must complete eight missions in an attempt to infiltrate Omega 19 and put a stop to its nefarious deeds once and for all.
To complete her objectives, Connors must rely on her skills in both combat and stealth. Players can use shadows to hide from patrolling guards, sneak up and pick their pockets to gain access to security cards, and perform silent attacks to disarm and disable her unsuspecting foes. Once a guard is taken down, players can pick up and hide the body so others won't detect it and sound the alarms.</desc>

This time, Mystery Inc. must stop an evil business tycoon who has used a device called the Tome of Doom and release monsters from another dimension to distract the gang from what is going on.

The player takes control of Shaggy and Scooby with the ability to switch between the two, each with their own special abilities to set traps and capture monsters, and wearing disguises to sneak past them as well.  The gameplay is mostly consisted of puzzle-solving (i.e. moving objects into certain spots to open doors) and players can explore a movie set, The Wild West, a bayou and a laboratory.

		<name>Sega Gt Online</name>
		<desc>Sega GT 2002 is the sequel to Wow Entertainment's Racing Game Sega GT, released in Japan late in 2002 as a competitor to the PlayStation 2's highly successful Gran Turismo 3. The game was originally intended to be released for the Dreamcast, but when the Dreamcast was discontinued in 2001, the game was reprogrammed for the Xbox. Following its initial release as a retail game, it was given away on a disk with Jet Set Radio Future in specially-marked Xbox console packages. Sega released Sega GT Online for the following year, with extra cars and an online facility to be used with the Xbox Live.

Sega GT 2002 introduced plenty of innovative features, many of which were later adopted by future games of its kind.

The game's cover features a Ford GT40 (called a Ford GT in the game), a Ford GT (called a Ford GT Concept in the game), and a Ford GT90.</desc>

You must protect your troops by directing their actions and throwing wind-up punches and flying kicks. While your small size lets you take shortcuts through small holes in the wall, it also makes a rolling apple as dangerous as a tumbling boulder.

		<name>Sniper Elite</name>
		<desc>Sniper Elite is a third-person action strategy game with a focus on sniping. The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are.

The single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target.</desc>

		<desc>In Sonic Riders, Dr. Eggman challenges Sonic and his friends to a Worldwide Grand Prix, and the prize for coming out on top is an ultra-rare Chaos Emerald! Gliding on air boards â which are performance-oriented for each playable character â gamers will experience a heightened sense of sports-style racing tension as Sonic and his pals perform tricks and stunts over treacherous wide-open terrain.

Sonic and friends speed through tracks on air boards, using individual special moves to strike down opponents. Air is a big element of Sonic Riders. Your board's "fuel" source is air. You can fill up your air at various points on the course, but to race well you'll have to use another means of replenishment: performing tricks with your board. You'll also want to make use of turbulence from racers who are in front of you.</desc>

		<desc>Splinter Cell Chaos Theory on Xbox is an infiltration game in which you once again play as Sam Fisher. From Panama to Korea via the USA, the goal remains more or less the same, to get as close as possible to your target thanks to a wide range of moves. Hang from the ceiling and then suspend yourself above a track riddled with motion-detecting lasers. Or would you rather slip into this narrow duct?</desc>

		<desc>Gamers return to the slopes in this third full edition of EA's exaggerated-action snowboarding series, SSX. As the game goes "On Tour," players create their own custom characters, which they'll develop from amateur bunny-hillers to seasoned "Black Diamond" pros. For the first time, the game allows skiers on the mountains as well, and players can decide if they'd rather ski or board when they create their characters. Building upon a distinguishing feature of the series, SSX On Tour features long, seamlessly streaming courses, some of which may take as long as half-an-hour (of real-time) to complete. The slopes are populated with fellow boarders and skiers in this edition, providing some extra personality. Featuring more than 40 songs, the diverse rock soundtrack includes selections by Def Leppard, The Hives, Iron Maiden, Bloc Party, Jurassic 5, and several others.</desc>

		<desc>The game of ten-pin bowling sees players attempt to knock down an arrangement of 10 pins in a triangular shape, by bowling a ball down a gutter-lined path. You have two shots, and score for how many you knock down on each bowl. As a reward for knocking down all ten pins, you will also get the score from your next bowl doubled if this took 2 shots (known as a 'spare'), or your next two bowls if it took 2 shots (known as a 'Strike').

In this implementation, you can play in one of 8 different settings, including a tropical island, ancient Egypt or on a pirate ship. There are 8 different AI players, each with varied appearance and reaction, and variable bowling ability. A range of playing modes including Tournament Play, Skins and practice are featured. Controls are designed to be easy to use, and ball reactions incorporate physics, ball friction and delivery style.</desc>

Each character has their own favorite bubble color and when they pop them, color energy is transferred to their special jar. Once the jar is full, the player can unleash their super special attack.

All of the levels from those two games are available in this collection, and all of the minigames are already unlocked and included. Formerly only available to GameCube players, the Super Monkey Ball series has made it to the PS2 and Xbox after a wait of almost 3 and a half years.

The game itself plays very much like the old arcade game Marble Madness. You control a monkey in a ball, and you have to navigate it through many perilous labyrinths to the finish. In the previous two games you had limited lives/tries, but here you have infinite lives, which makes it all the easier.</desc>

Imagination is the only height limit with Thrillville, where the fun ranges from racing on go-kart tracks you put together and playing mini-golf on courses you designed to joining friends for dozens of four-player party games, from bumper cars to arcade shoot-'em-ups. You can also tour the park on foot - a first for theme-park titles - chatting and joking with all the guests to help them out and make sure they're enjoying themselves.</desc>

		<desc>The series moved onto the 6th generation of gaming in August 2002, with the release of TOCA Race Driver (called DTM Race driver in Germany, Pro Race Driver in North America and V8 Supercars: Race Driver in Australia). The game took a new direction, reincluding the BTCC series that the previous game had been missing but most importantly, a plot (leading to the game being labelled as a "Car-PG") where the user took on the role of a fictional race driver called Ryan McKane, trying to make a name for himself in a multitude of car championships, all the while under the shadow of his more successful older brother and haunted by the death of his father on the racetrack (as witnessed by Ryan as a child).</desc>

		<desc>TOCA Race Driver 3 (also known as DTM Race Driver 3 in Germany and V8 Supercars 3 in Australia) is the third title of TOCA racing video game series, developed and published by Codemasters. TOCA Race Driver 3 was released in Europe and North America on February 24, 2006. The game features several fully licenced championships, including the DTM series and V8 Supercar championship. This is the last in the series to have TOCA in its title as following on from this TOCA was dropped in favour of just Race Driver (e.g. Race Driver GRID).

It includes 120 Championships and 35 Types of Racing through the Championship in World Tour, Pro Career, and Free Race. Also it has Bonus Championships in different disciplines. They take place largely in the UK and Germany, though many more tracks are unlocked by winning cups in Pro Career, or by setting a lap time record on a course within Pro Career mode. Open wheel, GT, Oval racing, Rallying and Off-road racing were all featured, and can be raced in either a detailed Pro Career mode or an open-ended World Tour.</desc>

		<desc>You are a new skater in the city of L.A.. The main drive of the game is that your hanging around with a skating group and its leader, who also happens to be a skating legend, at their skate park in Beverly Hills called Skate Ranch. Throughout the game you must help your friends by getting skate pieces for Skate Ranch.

The game marks the third reinvention of the series, with Pro Skater being the first, and Underground being the second. It comes with brand new features like the ability to change your personal appearance in game, as well as the ability to get off of the skateboard and use a BMX. For the first time all of levels are strung together into one big environment, which gets rid of loading times and menu selection.

Old features were also kept like Create-a-park, which dates back to the Pro Skater series. Missions are still acquired by going up to random people or friends and accepting the mission they want you to run.

The game also includes a multiplayer mode and co-op for up to 2 players for added replay value.</desc>

What's left over is a driving simulation that offers the rich gameplay of these heavy hitters, as well as a graphical show that's nearly on par with them, but none of the frills or splash that would attract casual players in search of a vicarious speed rush. It's a game for people who want to discover what the weekly toil of GT-class competition is really like, who understand that actual racing often entails driving around the same course lap after lap without much fear of hazards or obstacles, and who don't mind that the ultimate reward is the ability to drive a handful of different cars for various teams on tracks located throughout the world.</desc>

		<desc>Total Overdose on Xbox is an action game that takes you on a quest to explain the death of the hero's father, apparently linked to a dark story of drug trafficking. You'll have to use gunpowder and muscle to integrate the various cartels and get to the bottom of the whole story. The whole thing is sprinkled with humour and clichÃ©s of all kinds.</desc>

		<name>Totaled !</name>
		<desc>Totaled! is an action racing game, similar to the Destruction Derby games. Dispensing with any pretence of simulation, the game aims for arcade gameplay. The bright colours in the art style and easy way the cars can be turned with just a press of the handbrake all signal that this is not a game to be taken seriously. Although cosmetically the damage is locational, the cars do not suffer unduly if the damage is taken all in one area. Unlike the Destruction Derby games, you can continue to use your front to ram opponents throughout a match. Rather than have the cars race laps, matches more often take place in open arenas of sand, ice, grass, mud and tarmac.</desc>

That's what you'll be doing in TransWorld Snowboarding -- barrelling down the packed powder slopes at breakneck speeds while pulling off insane tricks, jibs and grinds on the quarter- and half-pipes, snow kickers and ramps. This is no bunny trail; you'll have to look out for steep cliffs, downed trees, ice blocks, and all manner of other mountain hazards. Choose from ten snowboarder pros and outfit them in the latest gear from real manufacturers such as Oakley and Volcomhit. Then hit the powder in real locations all over the world. Developer Housemarque has harnessed the power of the Xbox's graphics hardware to produce an extreme snowboarding event that's poised to give SSX a run for its money.</desc>

		<desc>Trigger Man is an action game where the main protagonist Trigger Man works for the Coladangelo Family, who is on the brink of a mafia-style war with the rival Montagano Family, which believes Don Coladangelo is responsible of the death of their Don's son. Shown from a third-person perspective players need to visit typical locations such as villas, restaurants and casinos to take down members of the opposing family.

Next to the basic action missions there is some focus on stealth and escorting too. Some sections require a key to be found in order to progress. While fighting, there is a focus on head shots, as enemies can take a lot of bullets in other body parts before going down. There are eight missions in total.

There are different types of weapons including a blade, machine guns and sniper rifles, but only a small amount of clips can be carried. Enemies hardly ever leave anything behind, so ammo crates need to be hunted down.</desc>

Its characteristically cute Japanese animation and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems.</desc>

		<desc>Unreal Championship can be played as a single player campaign or a multiplayer game.  In single player, you can fight solo against different and varying enemies, or you can lead a team in team-based games, like Capture the Flag and Bombing Run.  In multiplayer mode, you can play with up to four players on a single Xbox, or go online via Xbox Live to play with up to fifteen other people. There are five game modes; Deathmatch, which is your standard free for all, kill everyone; Capture The Flag, in which two teams fight to capture their enemies flag, then return it to theirs to score; Bombing Run, which is somewhat like soccer, where two teams have to take a ball and shoot it through a ring to score; Domination, where you must capture and hold three separate control points for a set time to score; and Survival, which is a last man standing kind of game, where the last person alive wins.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls a former Marine John Dalton, a Terran Colonial Authority Marshal whose job is to patrol remote areas of space far away from any real action. He is called back into service to retrieve seven pieces of an ancient artifact thought to make a powerful weapon when assembled.

The plot follows a pre-set linear path like many first-person shooters, with the character going to various planets in search of the artifacts. Level design at each location is also linear, with a certain amount of puzzle solving and key finding.

Environments on each planet are quite diverse, ranging from tropical to desert, bunkers and industrial installations, and alien cities and even inside the bodies of aliens. During several missions the player must hold a location against waves of incoming enemies, in some cases using NPCs and equipment (such as sentry guns) as support.</desc>

The main difference between the two games is that the singleplayer game is multiplayer-oriented, similar to Unreal Tournament. There is a storyline, however. You can select from one of three races fighting for the control of a beautiful, resource-rich planet named Kaladi. The Ohm are a cyborg-like race that need the planet's resources to live. The House of Kovos are robots that want to take control of Kaladi because their religion says that they should.

		<desc>A third-person action game which centers around the exploits of a crisis response team. The three player characters, Craig Contrell, Nick Bruno, and Mia Cabrera, must shoot their way through 30 missions of hostage rescuing, drug cartel smashing, and world saving in a wide variety of offices, warehouses, mansions, and laboratories. The most unique aspect of the game is its "Route" system. Each mission has two different characters, and is played through from both perspectives. During the first part each mission, a number of "Assist" points will happen where the player must assist the second character -- their performance here affects the playthrough of the second part of the mission, and doing well will reward you with cover fire or health bonuses later. There is also a multiplayer mode for up to four players, featuring several game mode including deathmatch and sniper battles. Bots are available if you have fewer than four players.</desc>

		<desc>Wings of War takes you back to World War I, as you take to the skies in a variety of early combat airplanes and fight off the German armada. The game is played as a 3rd-person arcade flyer in which most physics are downplayed in favor of arcade action. You can collect power-ups that can upgrade your engine, the amount of machine-guns you carry, replenish your health and shield (yes, shield) and increase the number of bombs and rockets you carry. You can also swap planes in mid-air, man turrets in AI-controlled bombers and even ground vehicles. The game features a single player campaign composed of several missions with dozens of mandatory objectives as well as optional ones played which reward extra points and/or upgrades. Also available is an online multiplayer mode with standard combat and CTF modes, as well as a customizable instant action mode.</desc>

Now, the match feels more real to the actual play as players make mistakes more often and passes don't go too well if the player is on the wrong foot, or makes a bad turn. The new gameplay may require slight adjustment for players to switch from older versions to this one. The standard modes are here, match mode (with newly added memorial match), various leagues, and cups. Some more teams now have their proper names (like "Arsenal" and "Chelsea"), and are having up to date players in the teams. Also, new weather condition has been added, snow.</desc>

The main difference between Road to Berlin and Iwo Jima is that you're now pitted against the Japanese instead of the Germans, as the only surviving member of a squad of Marines during the American conquest of the Japanese island Iwo Jima.</desc>

You are Steven Moore, a young officer in the Office of Strategic Services attempting to secure research and plans for the top secret German "Vengeance Weapons" during the last days of the war.  The Russians may be allies, but they also want this research for their own purposes - you must beat them to it. The single player game takes you through aircraft fields, submarine bunkers, underground complexes and finally the remains of a war torn Berlin. As with its predecessor, the real value in this title is the multiplayer. Seven multiplayer modes, a good assortment of weapons, simple play mechanics and large maps make for a surprisingly good experience. This game also features online bots, which is a feature its predecessor lacked.</desc>

The goal of the game hasn't changed a single bit from its predecessors: the objective is still to crush, annihilate and put into oblivion the worm team of the enemy using massively-wacky weapons of destruction. About all the features of its original 2D ancestors are also present, including random wind and a fully destructible landscape. Not all the weapons that were previously available have made the cut into the 3 dimensional realm, however Worms 3D comes too with a selective set of new weaponry such as the Lottery Strike or the Gas Grenade which should allow you to find a few dozen of new ways to kill your fellow worms online.</desc>

		<desc>Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions casts the player as either two members of the Hong Kong Police Force or as a pair of spies who must put a stop to the Yakuza (Japanese Mafia) stranglehold of Hong Kong. There are ten missions per side, for a total of twenty missions. Missions range from destroying cars to picking up documents to rescuing people. The game sports a real-time damage modeling system, so cars will break apart depending on how much they are damaged.  Hoods and doors will pop loose and fly off, glass will shatter and break, license plates will get knocked loose and swing from side to side before finally falling off. The environment can be damaged as well, with street carts falling to pieces and neon signs exploding into a shower of sparks. Each side starts with a default car, but both gain access to exclusive new rides as they complete missions or by finding and touching hidden cars during levels.</desc>

New modes include Ladder Matches, Table Matches, Cage Matches, and "Hell in a Cell." All of these modes can be played with up to five other CPU-controlled wrestlers (or three other human opponents). The season mode allows the player to choose any superstar, be it a WWE star or a wrestler he has created, and play his way through a year's worth of WWE programming. Set traps, interfere with other matches, steal from other wrestlers, and encourage others in order to make it all the way to Wrestlemania.</desc>

		<desc>The game offers the players a wrestling experience with various matches like singles match, tag team match, triple threat, fatal 4 way, battle royal and handicap matches. It has a weak/strong grapple system. There are two types of grapples: one which is done with normal opponents and other with groggy opponents. The normal grapples do little harm when compared to grapples done when the opponent is stunned. There is a voltage meter which shows the momentum of the wrestlers. Special move, high flying attacks and taunting boost the momentum while repeated attacks cost loss in momentum. Finishers can only be applied when the opponent is stunned and the voltage meter is flashing. Excessive use of finishers also cause loss in momentum.</desc>

The player controls a party of four characters, though only one at a time can be controlled directly. Beside switching the characters for combat purposes, the player is often obliged to do so, because some of the tasks in the game require the specific abilities of a certain mutant. For example, Iceman can put out fire, Magneto can generate a metal bridge across a gap, etc.. Most of the time, however, is spent in combat, collecting loot and acquiring experience points. Unlike the first game, items dropped by enemies are random. The character will level up, become stronger, and learn new skills. The player can opt to allocate all the experience and skill points manually.</desc>

		<desc>The space-witch Aguira, a young fragile girl, has turned the world of Mardar into living hell. Her sentence is death by the Maelstrom, a gigantic black hole.  But on route to the Maelstrom, the ship that carries her is hit by a meteorite full of Xyanide, which allows her to materialize her thoughts and escape.  Her first target, unsurprisingly, is Drake, her executioner who accompanies her into the Maelstrom. His ship becomes entangled into her world, and he has to fight her demons and destroy the crystals that power her devilish creations. Xyanide is essentially a 2D shooter, though technically, the graphics are three-dimensional. The player character advances automatically, the screen scrolling forward and often changing the camera view. The path is not entirely linear: at certain intersections, the player can choose where to go next. The game encompasses six large levels; regular enemies, mid-bosses, and end bosses will try to do everything in their might to foil Drake's mission.</desc>

		<desc>Players are led by a virtual personal fitness coach named Maya (voiced by Yumi Lee, who is also credited for workout design and modeling). Prior to the first workout, players must complete a fitness assessment. Players are asked to record their resting heart rates, then, following two minutes of jumping jacks, are asked to record their heart rates again. This data is used to approximate the relative intensity of the physical activity of completing that set of jumping jacks. This is then used to determine what types of exercises Maya will ask players to complete during their exercise routines. The fitness assessment also records players' self-reported weight and evaluates strength and flexibility.</desc>

		<name>Zathura</name>
		<desc>Zathura is a third-person platformer based on the 2005 fantasy science fiction film of the same name, which is in turn inspired by the book by Chris Van Allsburg. After an argument with his brother Walter, Danny goes into the basement of his house and finds an old mechanical board game. When they start to play the game, their house is catapulted into space, they get a large battle robot, and visit other planets in order to complete the game and return home. You play in turn as either one of the brothers or the robot. Walter can melee combat with a wrench and shoot projectiles while Danny has a slingshot, and the robot can shoot lasers or a charged shot, and can charge an enemy and jump high. As they progress through the different levels cut-scenes advance the story. They can grab power-ups and need to fight boss enemies as well.</desc>

		<name>BloodRayne</name>
		<desc>The game begins in 1933, in a place where it appears that the people believe in vampires, as all the doors and windows show crosses. It shows a man and woman running down a street. The woman trips, and the man pauses long enough to help her up, only to be dragged into a dark alleyway by a chain. His head is thrown from an alley at the woman's feet, with Rayne walking calmly up to the woman. The woman seemingly breaks down crying, but in fact only hides her face to reveal she is in fact a vampire. After a brief fight, Rayne decapitates her and then takes off before a small army of vampires tries to catch her off guard. She drops a grenade on their position as she leaves.

On top of the buildings, two mysterious men, who were watching the events unfold the whole time, are discussing their reason for being here. One reveals they are here to recruit Rayne, who is trying to find where her father is. The other member does not want a Dhampir with the Brimstone society, regardless of the fact that she is only half-vampire and has fewer weaknesses, as the Society is trying to rid the world of Vampires (and presumably people with Vampire blood in them). Eventually they agree to recruit Rayne, and leave a necklace with their symbol on it (as seen on the game cover).</desc>

In other words, roll out with your bike in the street to impress a number of people, and to collect as many coins as possible that will be very useful to you to rinse your eye.</desc>
