Designed for a new, more connected generation of racing fans, Need for Speed Most Wanted offers players an expansive open world packed with exhilarating action where they can choose their own path to become the Most Wanted. Players will have the freedom to drive anywhere, discover hidden gameplay, takedown rivals, challenge friends or just hang out and toy with the cops. Everything they do counts towards the end goal of becoming #1 on their personal Most Wanted List.

The only rule in Need for Speed Most Wanted is to race without rules. There's a start and a finish to every race -- but how the player races, where and when they choose to compete, and the skills they choose to compete with -- are all up to the player. It isn't enough to be the Most Wanted amongst rivals and cops. Now players will fight for ultimate bragging rights amongst their friends thanks to Autolog. In Need for Speed Most Wanted, everything players do will earn Speed Points that will take them up the Most Wanted list, from competing for best race times and battling cops in pursuits for the highest scores, to catching the most air off a huge ramp and more -- if there?s something to do, there's someone to beat.</desc>

Orcs have become victims of brutal Human expansion, as they are carelessly poisoning the environment. Now, four trained Orc heroes are retaliating with a Not-So-Silent yet very deadly plan. In either single-player or up to four-player co-op, you will take on the role of Orcs, each wielding a unique gaseous ability, and then take the fight to the Humans in a stinky, fart-filled romp. Hilarious enemies and highly tuned combat make for a joyous experience that really is worth sharing. While the comedic storyline and the striking 3D world make it even more memorable. Gross but charming protagonists add the final flourish with flatulent group attacks and nasty killer moves for up to four players.</desc>

		<desc>The mazes, the ghosts, the pellets. It's a Pac-Man game in looks, but not entirely in gameplay.

Unlike past editions or the original itself, Championship Edition DX twists the games style in a new direction, where the play field is littered with hundreds of ghosts that, when awoken as you move past, follow you in a conga line. Eat a power pellet and you can turn that line of ghosts into a massive points score, which in turns increases the speed of play. There are now two defensive tactics that can help you along the way as well. Pick up and use a bomb, and all the ghosts on the play field will be shot back to the central holding area for a few seconds. The speed will also suddenly slow down to a 'bullet time' like effect if you're too close to a ghost, giving you a chance to evade and continue on without losing a life.</desc>

		<desc>Sonic Championship is a 3D fighting game, featuring characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The background story is that Doctor Eggman built the Death Egg II, a new version of his facility that appeared in previous games. Stopping him requires Chaos Emeralds, and various individuals including heroes like Sonic the Hedgehog and Miles "Tails" Prower participate in a fighting tournament to gather them. In total there are eight playable characters (nine in later console releases) and two bosses (Metal Sonic and Doctor Eggman).Gameplay is mostly typical for a versus fighter, it is a one-on-one fight on a best two out of three basis. Players use jumps, punches, kicks and special weapons. Bean the Dynamite for example, a duck-like character who makes his debut in the Sonic universe, uses bombs. Blocking is done by making use of a limited supply of barriers. The whole action is illustrated in a comical fashion though, like one would expect from a Sonic game.</desc>

Players could inflict high and low horizontal and vertical attacks, block oncoming attacks, and use parries to gain a tactical advantage. Features such as Soul Crush and Armor Destruction first introduced in Soulcalibur IV have been retained; Soul Crush could be used to make opponents drop collectible items and weapons. Several mechanics were no longer present in the game, however, such as the ability to ring out a character, counter hits, and Just Guard. Guard Impact, while having the same properties as Soulcalibur V, no longer used a specific meter to execute. Two new mechanics were added: Weapon Arts, which granted each character unique attacks such as breaking through an enemy's guards; and support character feature, which allowed players to temporarily borrow another player's character online.</desc>

		<path>./Splinter Cell Blacklist.m3u</path>
		<name>Splinter Cell Blacklist</name>
		<desc>The game starts with Sam Fisher and his old friend Victor Coste who are about to depart from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam when an unknown enemy force destroys the entire base. Assisted by hacker specialist Charlie Cole, Sam and Vic manage to escape, although Vic is severely injured from protecting Sam from a grenade. Soon after, a terrorist organization calling itself "The Engineers" claims responsibility for the attack and announces that this attack is the first of a deadly countdown of escalating attacks on United States assets which they call "The Blacklist." They declare that they will halt the attacks only after the U.S. Government recalls all American troops deployed abroad.

In response, President of the United States Patricia Caldwell, who had just shut down the corrupt Third Echelon, assigns Fisher, Charlie Cole, Isaac Briggs and Anna 'Grim' Grímsdóttir to a newly created special operations and counter-terrorism unit called "Fourth Echelon." She installs Sam as the commander and charges the unit with the task of hunting down The Engineers and stopping them. Fourth Echelon's base of operations is a customizable cargo plane, codenamed "Paladin."

Sam and his new team's first course of action is to capture Andriy Kobin from a CIA safe house in Benghazi, Libya and obtain information from which they can learn more about The Engineers' plans. Sam successfully extracts Kobin and arrests him, keeping him aboard the Paladin. Kobin reveals some information about his business associates in Mirawa, Iraq. Infiltrating an insurgent stronghold there, Sam learns that the Blacklist attacks are more serious than originally thought. Sam arrives at a death chamber to find an executed US soldier whose execution was taped. The executioner was Majid Sadiq (Carlo Rota),[7] a terrorist and former MI6 agent. In the video, Sadiq directly tells Sam to stop intervening or suffer the consequences.

Intelligence from Mirawa points to the next Blacklist attack being in Dallas, Texas. Sam asserts to Fourth Echelon that a direct attack would be too simple and that the true target is another city. Charlie notes that the TSA list of "do not fly" citizens was offline for roughly six hours with a group of men traveling through Chicago's O'Hare International Airport during the time the list was offline. The target is a water filtration plant off Navy Pier, which is scheduled to release a hazardous biological agent into the water supply of Chicago. Sam stops the devices and shuts off the outflow valve, sparing Chicago.

Kobin reveals to Sam back on the Paladin intelligence about one of his associates, a dealer named Reza Nouri who supplies mercenaries for hire. Sam assaults his mansion in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay and interrogates Nouri. Nouri states that to whom he lends his men is none of Sam's business. During the interrogation, Nouri's mansion comes under attack from suspected operators of Quds Force. Nouri agrees to give up Sadiq in exchange for a safe extraction.

Grim and Charlie gain intelligence about a sleeper cell of The Engineers in London, England. The cell has been activated and Sam infiltrates an abandoned mill to gain intelligence on The Engineers' next plans. Sam finds shipping documents from Iran, confirming the suspicion that Iran and Quds Force were involved in the Blacklist attacks. With the last of the chemical bombs about to leave the shipping bay, Sam sneaks onto the truck and places a GPS tracking device inside the bomb. Sam is exposed to near lethal amounts of the chemical agent and, while trying to exfiltrate, is captured alive by Sadiq. Briggs, who was providing sniper overwatch, is forced to rescue Sam, but lets Sadiq escape.

After healing from the exposure to the chemical weapons, Sam infiltrates the former US embassy in Tehran, Iran, which has been transformed into a Quds Force headquarters. Sam installs a flash drive on a mainframe computer given to him by Charlie, which is programmed to search and rip anything related to the Blacklist attacks. The flash drive reveals nothing, proving that Iran is not behind the Blacklist attacks, reversing previous suspicions.

Back on the Paladin, Briggs informs Sam that the GPS tracker placed inside the bomb in London has reached US soil in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Grim analyzes that there are a total of four bombs containing hazardous nerve agents. The bombs arrive at the transit yards in Philadelphia, forcing Sam and Briggs to disarm the bombs before the nerve agents are released into the mass transit system. Grim's analysis also assess that a high value Engineer target is present. After Sam and Briggs successfully defuse the fourth bomb, Sam gives chase to the Engineer leader in the transit system. The Engineer escapes the train, but is shot dead on site by responding police officers.

Returning to the Paladin empty handed, Fourth Echelon is given a break when Nouri is checked in as a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Sam and Briggs form a plan to break into Guantanamo to interrogate Nouri again under Briggs' CIA credentials. Sam successfully interrogates Nouri who confirms that Sadiq is the mastermind behind the Blacklist attacks, but is unable to tell Sam when the next attack will be. Nouri also admits that Sadiq knows of Fourth Echelon and is aware of the team's individual identities. Sam evades capture and escapes the prison, riding off from the bay with the help of Briggs in a boat. Briggs drives himself and Sam to the Paladin, which has landed at an airstrip in the Yucatán province of Mexico.

Before Fourth Echelon can take off, the Paladin comes under assault by terrorists. Sam and Fourth Echelon fight off the attack, which Charlie reveals was his fault for contacting an old friend while landed. After taking off, the Paladin comes under a cyberattack directly from Sadiq. All of the intelligence on board the Paladin is compromised, as well as the on-board computers, leading the Paladin towards a crash in the Gulf of Mexico. Fourth Echelon successfully regains control of the Paladin, averting the crash. During the cyberattack, Sadiq successfully executes the "American Fuel" Blacklist attack on Sabine Pass, Louisiana, the largest oil reserve in the US.

While the US government activates continuity of government procedures, Sam assaults Sabine Pass, shutting down the leaking oil from reaching other reserve posts, averting a chain reaction. Another high value Engineer is present, to whom Sam gives chase. The Engineer reveals the true and final plans of Sadiq: to extract all US military secrets. Knowing continuity of government procedures, Sadiq successfully kidnaps a group of high level civilian and military personnel, including the Secretary Of Defense, and holds them at the Site F government bunker under Denver International Airport (DIA).

Fourth Echelon calls President Caldwell, who directly orders Fourth Echelon to divert from Denver. The Paladin pilots refuse to defy orders, so Sam orders Kobin to relieve the pilots of duty. Kobin successfully drops Briggs and Sam during a blackout landing at Denver. Briggs and Sam assault DIA, tasked with planting a virus which Charlie custom-built to safeguard against the transfer of files to Sadiq. Briggs surrenders to Sadiq in the computer terminal, separated from the other hostages. Sadiq's men torture the Secretary of Defense into complying with their demands, but Briggs intervenes, killing the Secretary before he can begin the data transfer.

The Engineers attempts to flee Site F using Briggs and the other hostages as human shields. It is revealed that Sam is disguised in an Air Force uniform at the very rear of the hostage group. Sam breaks free from his captors as Delta Force marksmen open fire on Sadiq and his men, and Sadiq escapes on foot after wounding Briggs. An unarmed Sam gives chase, disarming and assaulting Sadiq, before wounding him and taking him into custody. Even upon defeat, Sadiq claims that he has already "won," threatening Sam that if he kills him, the twelve nations who are secretly backing The Engineers will rise and if he puts him on trial, he will "spill every secret he knows." Leaving him with no choice, Sam employs the Fifth Freedom and unofficially imprisons Sadiq, while President Caldwell announces that he is killed and the game ends with Fourth Echelon prepares to continue operations. In the post-credits, it is revealed that Vic had recovered from his injuries and both he and Sam are seen about to interrogate the captive Sadiq.</desc>

Each of the Autobots are able to use a variety of melee attacks and ranged weapons, and are able to transform into vehicle mode at any time. Similar to Bayonetta, successfully dodging attacks activates Focus, which slows down time around the player, allowing them to counterattack their opponents. Each Autobot also has a unique special ability and a powerful Overdrive attack that can be performed with enough energy.</desc>

		<name>Wonder Boy In Monster World</name>
		<desc>Monster World was once a peaceful region. Then, the peace was shattered by an invading army of monsters. A young man named Shion vowed to defeat them and make his land peaceful again.

Wonder Boy In Monster World is the third game in the Monster World spin-off series, originally known as Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3. It puts the player in control of Shion in his quest to save Monster World from the evil hands of BioMeka. It controls like a standard platform game - run, jump, and kill enemies. The game has light RPG elements such as talking to townsfolk, collecting money to buy items, upgrading your life, and equipping a variety of armor and weapons - staying very close to the Zelda format. You can save your game to continue your quest at a later time.</desc>

		<name>Worms Crazy Golf</name>
		<desc>Worms Crazy Golf is a brazenly bonkers mixture of classic 2D Worms and hilarious eighteen-hole hijinks. Spread across a variety of weird and wonderful courses and featuring some mind-bendingly mental power-ups, this is the craziest golf you'll ever play. With many fan-favorite features from the Worms universe such as the sheep, old woman, mole, magnets, mines and crazy chain reactions making an appearance, it is anything but a straight simulation. Set across three surreal 18-hole golf courses plus a diverse range of skill-based challenge modes, expect to be challenged by increasingly puzzling hole design and an array of obstacles; from castles that teleport your ball, cannons that shoot it across the landscape and even obstructive comedy bats! Only skillful shot execution and clever use of special powers such as the parachute ball, or the ability to slow time down will see you hit par and progress to the next hole.</desc>

Planar rifts are appearing in various locations around the country and it is suspected that the Drexler Institute, a player in the Great War many years ago and creator of the Divine Celestial Weapon, is involved. There is a rumor circulating that if one gets their hands on a celestial stone from a rift, their wishes will be granted. Their power draws many young women to search for them, either to seal them away or in hopes that the rumors are true. Each has their own reasons for the hunt, and they won't allow anyone stand in their way, enemy...or friend alike.</desc>

		<desc>LittleBigPlanet 3 is the third main game in the puzzle-platformer series and created by a different developer than the previous two. The game has an overarching story for the first time, with voiced supporting characters and cut-scene sequences, and it is set in Bunkum where the familiar Sackboy character meets Newton. He tricks Sackboy into unleashing three Titans, creatures that were locked up because they robbed the world of creativity.</desc>

		<desc>LittleBigPlanet is a puzzle platformer where the player controls sackboys. It takes the characters on an adventure through levels with different themes and settings, trying to reach the end of each level alive. The platforming is based entirely on physics where the sackboys can push or pull items, or generally manipulate them with their movement or weight. In addition to running, jumping, pushing and pulling, it is also necessary to master grabbing dangling objects and swinging from them to get over some obstacles and traps.</desc>
