		<desc>Do you have what it takes to become Most Wanted? Designed for a new, more connected generation of racing fans, Need for Speed Most Wanted offers players an expansive open world packed with exhilarating action where they can choose their own path to become the Most Wanted. Players will have the freedom to drive anywhere, discover hidden gameplay, takedown rivals, challenge friends or just hang out and toy with the cops. Everything they do counts towards the end goal of becoming #1 on their personal Most Wanted List.

The only rule in Need for Speed Most Wanted is to race without rules. There's a start and a finish to every race -- but how the player races, where and when they choose to compete, and the skills they choose to compete with -- are all up to the player. It isn't enough to be the Most Wanted amongst rivals and cops. Now players will fight for ultimate bragging rights amongst their friends thanks to Autolog. In Need for Speed Most Wanted, everything players do will earn Speed Points that will take them up the Most Wanted list, from competing for best race times and battling cops in pursuits for the highest scores, to catching the most air off a huge ramp and more -- if there?s something to do, there's someone to beat.</desc>

Orcs have become victims of brutal Human expansion, as they are carelessly poisoning the environment. Now, four trained Orc heroes are retaliating with a Not-So-Silent yet very deadly plan. In either single-player or up to four-player co-op, you will take on the role of Orcs, each wielding a unique gaseous ability, and then take the fight to the Humans in a stinky, fart-filled romp. Hilarious enemies and highly tuned combat make for a joyous experience that really is worth sharing. While the comedic storyline and the striking 3D world make it even more memorable. Gross but charming protagonists add the final flourish with flatulent group attacks and nasty killer moves for up to four players.</desc>

		<desc>The mazes, the ghosts, the pellets. It's a Pac-Man game in looks, but not entirely in gameplay.

Unlike past editions or the original itself, Championship Edition DX twists the games style in a new direction, where the play field is littered with hundreds of ghosts that, when awoken as you move past, follow you in a conga line. Eat a power pellet and you can turn that line of ghosts into a massive points score, which in turns increases the speed of play. There are now two defensive tactics that can help you along the way as well. Pick up and use a bomb, and all the ghosts on the play field will be shot back to the central holding area for a few seconds. The speed will also suddenly slow down to a 'bullet time' like effect if you're too close to a ghost, giving you a chance to evade and continue on without losing a life.</desc>

		<desc>If sniping in real life "outside of the whole morality issue" was as easy as it is in Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, then a few soldiers probably could save the world. Unless you?re playing on the hardest mode, bullet-drop indicators and omniscient AI teammates make sure you know exactly who to shoot and when, taking almost all the tension out of pulling the trigger. Ghost Warrior 2 ultimately does exactly what I feared the most when I started: it takes one of the highest forms of shooting skill and makes it repetitive and uninteresting.</desc>

Features such as Soul Crush and Armor Destruction first introduced in Soulcalibur IV have been retained; Soul Crush could be used to make opponents drop collectible items and weapons. Several mechanics were no longer present in the game, however, such as the ability to ring out a character, counter hits, and Just Guard. Guard Impact, while having the same properties as Soulcalibur V, no longer used a specific meter to execute. Two new mechanics were added: Weapon Arts, which granted each character unique attacks such as breaking through an enemy's guards; and support character feature, which allowed players to temporarily borrow another player's character online.</desc>

		<name>Splinter Cell Blacklist</name>
		<desc>The game starts with Sam Fisher and his old friend Victor Coste who are about to depart from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam when an unknown enemy force destroys the entire base. Assisted by hacker specialist Charlie Cole, Sam and Vic manage to escape, although Vic is severely injured from protecting Sam from a grenade. Soon after, a terrorist organization calling itself "The Engineers" claims responsibility for the attack and announces that this attack is the first of a deadly countdown of escalating attacks on United States assets which they call "The Blacklist." They declare that they will halt the attacks only after the U.S. Government recalls all American troops deployed abroad.

In response, President of the United States Patricia Caldwell, who had just shut down the corrupt Third Echelon, assigns Fisher, Charlie Cole, Isaac Briggs and Anna 'Grim' Grímsdóttir to a newly created special operations and counter-terrorism unit called "Fourth Echelon." She installs Sam as the commander and charges the unit with the task of hunting down The Engineers and stopping them. Fourth Echelon's base of operations is a customizable cargo plane, codenamed "Paladin."

Sam and his new team's first course of action is to capture Andriy Kobin from a CIA safe house in Benghazi, Libya and obtain information from which they can learn more about The Engineers' plans. Sam successfully extracts Kobin and arrests him, keeping him aboard the Paladin. Kobin reveals some information about his business associates in Mirawa, Iraq. Infiltrating an insurgent stronghold there, Sam learns that the Blacklist attacks are more serious than originally thought. Sam arrives at a death chamber to find an executed US soldier whose execution was taped. The executioner was Majid Sadiq (Carlo Rota),[7] a terrorist and former MI6 agent. In the video, Sadiq directly tells Sam to stop intervening or suffer the consequences.

Intelligence from Mirawa points to the next Blacklist attack being in Dallas, Texas. Sam asserts to Fourth Echelon that a direct attack would be too simple and that the true target is another city. Charlie notes that the TSA list of "do not fly" citizens was offline for roughly six hours with a group of men traveling through Chicago's O'Hare International Airport during the time the list was offline. The target is a water filtration plant off Navy Pier, which is scheduled to release a hazardous biological agent into the water supply of Chicago. Sam stops the devices and shuts off the outflow valve, sparing Chicago.

Kobin reveals to Sam back on the Paladin intelligence about one of his associates, a dealer named Reza Nouri who supplies mercenaries for hire. Sam assaults his mansion in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay and interrogates Nouri. Nouri states that to whom he lends his men is none of Sam's business. During the interrogation, Nouri's mansion comes under attack from suspected operators of Quds Force. Nouri agrees to give up Sadiq in exchange for a safe extraction.

Grim and Charlie gain intelligence about a sleeper cell of The Engineers in London, England. The cell has been activated and Sam infiltrates an abandoned mill to gain intelligence on The Engineers' next plans. Sam finds shipping documents from Iran, confirming the suspicion that Iran and Quds Force were involved in the Blacklist attacks. With the last of the chemical bombs about to leave the shipping bay, Sam sneaks onto the truck and places a GPS tracking device inside the bomb. Sam is exposed to near lethal amounts of the chemical agent and, while trying to exfiltrate, is captured alive by Sadiq. Briggs, who was providing sniper overwatch, is forced to rescue Sam, but lets Sadiq escape.

After healing from the exposure to the chemical weapons, Sam infiltrates the former US embassy in Tehran, Iran, which has been transformed into a Quds Force headquarters. Sam installs a flash drive on a mainframe computer given to him by Charlie, which is programmed to search and rip anything related to the Blacklist attacks. The flash drive reveals nothing, proving that Iran is not behind the Blacklist attacks, reversing previous suspicions.

Back on the Paladin, Briggs informs Sam that the GPS tracker placed inside the bomb in London has reached US soil in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Grim analyzes that there are a total of four bombs containing hazardous nerve agents. The bombs arrive at the transit yards in Philadelphia, forcing Sam and Briggs to disarm the bombs before the nerve agents are released into the mass transit system. Grim's analysis also assess that a high value Engineer target is present. After Sam and Briggs successfully defuse the fourth bomb, Sam gives chase to the Engineer leader in the transit system. The Engineer escapes the train, but is shot dead on site by responding police officers.

Returning to the Paladin empty handed, Fourth Echelon is given a break when Nouri is checked in as a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Sam and Briggs form a plan to break into Guantanamo to interrogate Nouri again under Briggs' CIA credentials. Sam successfully interrogates Nouri who confirms that Sadiq is the mastermind behind the Blacklist attacks, but is unable to tell Sam when the next attack will be. Nouri also admits that Sadiq knows of Fourth Echelon and is aware of the team's individual identities. Sam evades capture and escapes the prison, riding off from the bay with the help of Briggs in a boat. Briggs drives himself and Sam to the Paladin, which has landed at an airstrip in the Yucatán province of Mexico.

Before Fourth Echelon can take off, the Paladin comes under assault by terrorists. Sam and Fourth Echelon fight off the attack, which Charlie reveals was his fault for contacting an old friend while landed. After taking off, the Paladin comes under a cyberattack directly from Sadiq. All of the intelligence on board the Paladin is compromised, as well as the on-board computers, leading the Paladin towards a crash in the Gulf of Mexico. Fourth Echelon successfully regains control of the Paladin, averting the crash. During the cyberattack, Sadiq successfully executes the "American Fuel" Blacklist attack on Sabine Pass, Louisiana, the largest oil reserve in the US.

While the US government activates continuity of government procedures, Sam assaults Sabine Pass, shutting down the leaking oil from reaching other reserve posts, averting a chain reaction. Another high value Engineer is present, to whom Sam gives chase. The Engineer reveals the true and final plans of Sadiq: to extract all US military secrets. Knowing continuity of government procedures, Sadiq successfully kidnaps a group of high level civilian and military personnel, including the Secretary Of Defense, and holds them at the Site F government bunker under Denver International Airport (DIA).

Fourth Echelon calls President Caldwell, who directly orders Fourth Echelon to divert from Denver. The Paladin pilots refuse to defy orders, so Sam orders Kobin to relieve the pilots of duty. Kobin successfully drops Briggs and Sam during a blackout landing at Denver. Briggs and Sam assault DIA, tasked with planting a virus which Charlie custom-built to safeguard against the transfer of files to Sadiq. Briggs surrenders to Sadiq in the computer terminal, separated from the other hostages. Sadiq's men torture the Secretary of Defense into complying with their demands, but Briggs intervenes, killing the Secretary before he can begin the data transfer.

The Engineers attempts to flee Site F using Briggs and the other hostages as human shields. It is revealed that Sam is disguised in an Air Force uniform at the very rear of the hostage group. Sam breaks free from his captors as Delta Force marksmen open fire on Sadiq and his men, and Sadiq escapes on foot after wounding Briggs. An unarmed Sam gives chase, disarming and assaulting Sadiq, before wounding him and taking him into custody. Even upon defeat, Sadiq claims that he has already "won," threatening Sam that if he kills him, the twelve nations who are secretly backing The Engineers will rise and if he puts him on trial, he will "spill every secret he knows." Leaving him with no choice, Sam employs the Fifth Freedom and unofficially imprisons Sadiq, while President Caldwell announces that he is killed and the game ends with Fourth Echelon prepares to continue operations. In the post-credits, it is revealed that Vic had recovered from his injuries and both he and Sam are seen about to interrogate the captive Sadiq.</desc>

Each of the Autobots are able to use a variety of melee attacks and ranged weapons, and are able to transform into vehicle mode at any time. Similar to Bayonetta, successfully dodging attacks activates Focus, which slows down time around the player, allowing them to counterattack their opponents. Each Autobot also has a unique special ability and a powerful Overdrive attack that can be performed with enough energy.</desc>

Each contestant spins the wheel and has to suggest a consonant they think is in the word. Little by little, the word is revealed and the one who finds it wins. But beware of "bankruptcy"!</desc>

The people were very proud of him and gave Tom-Tom the highest honor of all - the legendary name of Wonder Boy. With the evil King defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom was a paradise, and everything and everyone lived happily together.
Eventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately thrown into utter chaos. The people were quickly taken over and the tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and devils. Wonder Land was now a Monster Land. Tom-Tom was summoned to set out on a journey, destroy this dragon, and restore peace once again. Tom-Tom is Wonder Land's last hope.</desc>

		<desc>Monster World was once a peaceful region. Then, the peace was shattered by an invading army of monsters. A young man named Shion vowed to defeat them and make his land peaceful again.

Wonder Boy In Monster World is the third game in the Monster World spin-off series, originally known as Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3. It puts the player in control of Shion in his quest to save Monster World from the evil hands of BioMeka. It controls like a standard platform game - run, jump, and kill enemies. The game has light RPG elements such as talking to townsfolk, collecting money to buy items, upgrading your life, and equipping a variety of armor and weapons - staying very close to the Zelda format. You can save your game to continue your quest at a later time.</desc>

Arcana Heart 3 combines fast-paced aerial action with a unique cast for an extraordinary fighting experience!


Chaos and disorder are threatening to rip apart the very fabric of Japanese society as planar rifts appear throughout the country. It is suspected that the Drexler Institute, the instigator of the Great War many years ago and creator of the Divine Celestial Weapon, is somehow involved. In the midst of this confusion, a mysterious rumor arises, claiming the existence of wish-granting "Celestial Stones" within the chaotic planar rifts. As a result of these rumors, a number of individuals have converged on Japan in the hopes of obtaining one of these fabled stones – either to seal them away or to see for themselves if rumor is true. Each person has their own reasons for seeking these rare and valuable stones, and they won't let anyone stand in their way, be they foe ... or friend.</desc>

		<desc>Dynasty Warriors 8 (??????7 Shin Sangokumus? 7?, known in Japan as Shin Sangokumusou 7) is a hack and slash video game and the eighth official installment of the Dynasty Warriors series. It is developed by Omega Force and published by Tecmo Koei. The story is based on the Chinese writer Luo Guanzhong's historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The game was unveiled on October 30, 2012 via Jump Magazine and released on February 28, 2013 for the PlayStation 3 in Japan.[3] On April 3, 2013, it was confirmed by Tecmo Koei that there would be an overseas release for both North America and Europe in July 2013. It was released on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 for both physical and digital release. The option of English and Japanese voice overs also return, where there is also an option to change the subtitles to English, French or German.

Having more than 82 characters featured in the game,[13][14] the game largely based its system from Dynasty Warriors 7 and instead focused on adding more content for replayability as well as several tweaks in the combat system.[15] The game is followed by two expansions. The first, Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends was released for PlayStation 3 on November 28, 2013 in Japan and on 2014 in North America and Europe. Versions for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4 are developed as well, both of which package the expansion with the original version and are released under the title of Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends Complete Edition.[7] The PlayStation Vita version was released on the same day as PlayStation 3, while the PlayStation 4 version was released as a launch title for the console in Japan, on March 25, 2014 in North America, and on April 4, 2014 for Europe.[16] The PC port for Complete Edition released on May 13, 2014. The second expansion, Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires was released for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 20, 2014 in Japan,[1] with North American and European versions released in February 2015 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows (via Steam).</desc>

		<name>Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds</name>
		<desc>Hot Shots Golf makes its first appearance on PlayStation 3 with online support for multiplayer competition and a new shot system. The framework is otherwise the same as in previous games in the series, which began on the original PlayStation in 1998. Cutesy characters with large heads and whimsical expressions can compete on six new courses filled with onlookers, animals, and other animated surprises. The new venues take place along a coast, on a mountain range, in the woods, and across a desert. The shot system by default forgoes the horizontal power meter in favor of a swing-based approach in which players use visual cues to time their backswings and follow-throughs. Traditionalists can still, however, revert back to the old swing system from the options menu.

Once again a number of customization features are available to personalize each of the game's 15 characters and six caddies. By competing in different events, players can unlock new equipment such as enhanced clubs and balls. Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds also includes a robust online component, with the ability to create custom tournaments supporting up to 50 players. Online avatars can be tweaked with 300 visual options, including hairstyles, masks, clothing, and more. Players can also send messages to friends, or visit the PlayStation Store to purchase new courses, clubs, characters, and other features. Key play modes include Versus, Training, Tournament, Stroke, and Match Play. Detailed statistics are tracked throughout each mode and challenge, from best average score and driving distance to average putt length and putting accuracy.</desc>

The LittleBigPlanet experience starts with players learning about their character's powers to interact physically with the environment. There are places to explore, creative resources to collect and puzzles to solve - all requiring a combination of brains and collaborative teamwork. As soon as players begin, their creative skills will grow and they will soon be ready to start creating and modifying their surroundings - the first step to sharing them with the whole community. 

Players can make their world as open or as secretive to explore as they like. When it's ready, they can invite anyone within the LittleBigPlanet community to come and explore their patch - or can go and explore everybody else's.</desc>

		<desc>Naughty Bear is a third-person shooter/action video game. Players control the eponymous bear as they use various things to earn "Naughty Points", with extra points being given for random missions.
 
The game is set on a paradisiacal island where teddy bears live in harmony. The main character, Naughty Bear, is a shabby teddy bear who has a tendency to be mischievous, which earns him the dislike of the other bears. Like the other teddy bears, he does not speak but instead conveys his emotions through a variety of sounds and facial expressions. His actions are influenced by an unseen narrator with a demeanor reminiscent of that of a young children's television show host.</desc>

		<name>NHL 13</name>
		<desc>NHL 13 is an ice hockey video game developed by EA Canada published by EA Sports. It is the 22nd installment of the NHL series and was released on September 11, 2012 in North America, Europe as well as Australia and New Zealand. The game was released on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, featuring Philadelphia Flyers forward Claude Giroux on the cover.[1] The game was featured at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012 (E3 2012), which took place between June 5–7, 2012. The demo of the game was released on August 21–22, 2012, at the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store.[4]

There was a vote deciding which player would be on the NHL 13 cover. Anybody could vote on the player(s) they wished to see on the cover of the game. The vote started on March 29, 2012 with 60 NHL players in a single-elimination voting with two players in each match-up, and was closed on June 4, receiving over 25 million votes worldwide.[5] On June 20, Claude Giroux was named the winner, over Pekka Rinne at the 2012 NHL Awards in Las Vegas.[6]

An exclusive "Stanley Cup Collector's Edition" was also released, apart from the actual NHL 13 game. The Collector's Edition includes five random Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) player packs from the two 2012 Stanley Cup Finals teams; a Gold Jumbo HUT pack including legend Wayne Gretzky; and a boost pack featuring the CCM RBZ stick.[7]

Just like in NHL 12, Gary Thorne (play-by-play) and Bill Clement (color) provide commentary for NHL 13.[8]

This year, for the first time, two playable female characters, Hayley Wickenheiser and Angela Ruggiero have been added.[9] In NHL 12, users could create female characters, but there were no real-life players.[10]

On September 20, Gamesindustry.biz reported that NHL 13 had posted the best first week sales in the franchise's history.[11]</desc>

Sly 2 features a health meter for characters such as Sly, Bentley and Murray, replacing the "charm system" of the first game. It also takes several attacks to defeat guards. Other changes include missions where the player controls Bentley or Murray, who have their own unique skills and are able to do much more than in the previous game. However, Sly remains the main character despite these changes to character roles. Skills can be unlocked by opening safes in each world, as the previous game allowed (collecting clue bottles), but skills may also be acquired by collecting coins and purchasing them from safehouses via Thiefnet.</desc>

Although they are still weary from the adventures in the previous game, they have to get up and face the new threat that could mean the end of Sly's business and the loss of his family heritage. The game itself is a lot like the previous games: Sly sneaks, jumps, and swings himself around the levels, collecting various items, defeating bad guys and ultimately taking on the boss character. The other members of the gang step in on the action once in a while but the Sly centric sections are the main focus of the game. If you like games that had many things to do, this sneak-em-up/platform/action/adventure/puzzle game is for you.</desc>

		<desc>Sonic Adventure (??????????? Sonikku Adobencha?) is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega. It was originally released for the Dreamcast as a launch title in Japan in 1998, and worldwide the following year. It was the first game in the main Sonic the Hedgehog series since Sonic &amp; Knuckles in 1994, and was the best-selling game on the Dreamcast.

After series villain Doctor Eggman releases an ancient monster, protagonist Sonic the Hedgehog vows to stop him collecting the Chaos Emeralds. The other playable characters are flying fox Miles "Tails" Prower, love interest Amy Rose, Knuckles the Echidna, who plans to reassemble the Master Emerald, angler Big the Cat, and E-102 Gamma, one of Eggman's robots.

Sonic Adventure received generally positive reviews for its graphics, gameplay, and soundtrack. It became the best-selling Dreamcast game. A sequel, Sonic Adventure 2, was released in 2001 for the Dreamcast. Enhanced ports of the game were released in 2003 for the Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft Windows. It has since been re-released as a downloadable game for Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade, and PlayStation 3 via PlayStation Network in 2010. It is also included in the Dreamcast Collection for the Xbox 360.</desc>

Classic Sonic's levels are strictly two dimensional side scrolling stages, using classic moves like the Spin Attack and Spin Dash, while Modern Sonic's levels follow the 2D/3D style gameplay of Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors, featuring techniques such as boosting and homing attacks. As well as classic power-ups such as Invincibility and Speed Shoes, certain levels have unique power-ups, such as skateboards in City Escape and Wisp powers in Planet Wisp.</desc>

		<name>Sonic the Fighters</name>
		<desc>Sonic Championship is a 3D fighting game, featuring characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The background story is that Doctor Eggman built the Death Egg II, a new version of his facility that appeared in previous games. Stopping him requires Chaos Emeralds, and various individuals including heroes like Sonic the Hedgehog and Miles "Tails" Prower participate in a fighting tournament to gather them. In total there are eight playable characters (nine in later console releases) and two bosses (Metal Sonic and Doctor Eggman).

Gameplay is mostly typical for a versus fighter, it is a one-on-one fight on a best two out of three basis. Players use jumps, punches, kicks and special weapons. Bean the Dynamite for example, a duck-like character who makes his debut in the Sonic universe, uses bombs. Blocking is done by making use of a limited supply of barriers. The whole action is illustrated in a comical fashion though, like one would expect from a Sonic game. A round is won when a player managed to deplete an opponent's health, unless the timer runs out, in which case the character with the most energy left is the winner. Environments are 3D closed arenas, but the gameplay is mostly 2D, allowing limited sidestep maneuvers.</desc>

		<desc>Not even a day has fully passed since you rescued the US president from Mexican soil and you and the rest of your Ghost team are on the way home, when the General phones in and gives you your next mission: a group of terrorists deposited two dirty bombs (normal blasting compositions combined with radioactive material) near the city of Juarez. Your goal as Captain Mitchell is to once again save the day with your three teammates.
nnLike in its predecessor Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter, you see Captain Mitchell from behind while you command your teammates directly over the Cross-Com to fulfil your objectives, like blowing up a bunch of anti-air vehicles and then raiding a rebel outpost. To do so, you have the normal Ghost team weaponry like the MR-C at your disposal, which you can equip you and your team with before and even at some points during the missions. You also have access to a tactical map which allows you to see an aerial view of the current level.</desc>

		<desc>Toy Story 3: The Video Game is a platform video game loosely based on the film Toy Story 3. It was published by Disney Interactive Studios (which is the developer for iOS) and developed by Avalanche Software (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360, PC, Mac OS X), Asobo Studio (PS2, PSP) and n-Space (DS). The game was released in North America on June 15, 2010, for the iOS, Nintendo DS, Wii, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and the Xbox 360. A special PlayStation 2 bundle with Toy Story 3: The Video Game was released on October 31, 2010, followed by the game's individual release on November 2, 2010.[1][2] It's the only video game based on the Toy Story franchise to be released for the PlayStation 2, as well as the last video game based on a Disney and/or Pixar product on the console.

Toy Story 3 is the first game based on a film by Pixar to be published entirely by Disney Interactive Studios. Past Disney/Pixar movie games have been made in conjunction with Activision first, then THQ.[3] It is the sequel to the second game that was based on the second film in the franchise.

Most of the voice cast from the film returned to reprise their characters in the game with the exception of Tom Hanks (Woody) and Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear). Jim Hanks returned to voice Woody from the Toy Story 2 game, and Mike MacRae voiced Buzz. The game also contains content exclusive to the PlayStation 3 version that allows the player(s) to turn into Zurg in Woody's Round up.[4] The game was well received by critics and was a top-seller in the UK.</desc>

For the United States, Blu-ray Disc and PlayStation Network versions were released on August 28, 2007. The PlayStation Network version was released in Europe, Australia and Japan on August 30, August 31 and October 4 respectively. The Blu-ray Disc version was released in Australia and Europe on September 20 and September 21, respectively, but was not released in Japan.</desc>

		<name>Warriors Orochi 3</name>
		<desc>Warriors Orochi 3 is the third installment in the Warriors Orochi series and the sequel of Warriors Orochi 2.

After vanquishing Orochi, a period of peace came to the land. That peace is suddenly shattered by the appearance of a Hydra. Warriors from different worlds gather to father the Hydra, but only three survive. With the help of the mystic Kaguya, Sima Zhao, Ma Chao and Hanbei Takenaka set to travel in time to save their fallen comrades and form an army against the new threat.

Starting with only four characters, the player sets to gather warriors by altering the outcome of different battles. The characters consist of the characters from the Dynasty Warriors series and Samurai Warriors series and a few from other games such as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive.

The player chooses three warriors before each stage. In battle, these characters can switch places at any time to fight against hordes of enemy soldiers and officers, gathering experience and gems until the victory conditions are met. Weapons and items can also be acquired in battle. Between each battle, the player is sent back to the camp, where he can buy and customize weapons, make characters bond together, equip the characters and distribute growth points to raise the character's level. If certain conditions are met, discussions between specific warriors will unlock new stages or an alternate "Redux" version of a previously cleared battle.</desc>
