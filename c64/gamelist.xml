		<desc>Aegean Voyage is a game that challenges your mind as it captures your imagination. Navigate your ships through the Aegean, docking at mysterious islands to collect valuable clues from oracles. Connect the clues, and you'll learn where to look for fantastic treasures.

But the Aegean is a tricky place and you'll need to use your head if you want to make it back to Athens unharmed and laden with treasures.

Educational Value: Aegean Voyage helps children exercise deductive reasoning and learn to plan strategies by analyzing choices. It also improves memory and concentration and introduces many of the characters and places in Greek mythology. Ages 8-Adult.</desc>

		<name>After the War</name>
		<desc>Year 2019, Manhattan. After a nuclear war.  

Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as "Jungle Rogers", the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.

There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later he awaits for the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls a small jetplane and has the task of killing giant yellow camels before they reach the home base. Doing so requires several dozens of shots. The camels retaliate by shooting fireballs from their mouth.

Each camel required several shots to destroy; if a camel reached the base, the game was over. Once all camels on a level had been killed, the player had to survive a "hyperspace" sequence which required avoiding high-speed missiles. Upon successful completion, the next level presented a new wave of camels, with slightly harder gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>Badlands continued the Super Sprint lineage, but moved the game into a futuristic post-apocalyptic setting. The races consist of 3 souped-up cars toughing it out over 4 laps on one of the 8 tracks, which are viewed from above. Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. 

You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.</desc>

Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.</desc>

		<desc>Beamrider is a 3D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occasionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</desc>

		<desc>In this game you must save your girlfriend Daisy from Ollie Ogre. To do this, you have to assemble the pieces of a ball-throwing machine. The pieces are inside some houses inside a maze, and you have a limited time before Ollie Ogre catches your beloved Daisy! Every now and then, a monster tries to disassemble the machine, a flower pot can fall on your head, and some monsters populate the maze in the levels after the first one, but your worst enemy is your memory! If you enter into a house that you have already visited, you get a bomb instead of a piece, and you have to put it in the bin before it explodes, losing precious time when Ollie Ogre comes dearer to Daisy. When the machine is assembled, you push the start button and begin to launch the balls to Ollie, hoping to catch him before he catches Daisy</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Games/Centipede (USA, Europe).crt</path>
		<name>Centipede</name>
		<desc>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. 

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.
Dual Player Competition
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.
Team Play
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.

Scoring
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:

Centipede Head - 100 points
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points
Spider at close range - 900 points
Spider at medium range - 600 points
Flea - 200 points
Scorpion - 1,000 points
Flea - 200 points
Restored mushroom - 5 points
Destroyed mushroom - 1 points</desc>

		<desc>In the area which lies a few miles east of Patagonia and to the south of Kurdistan lies the Bungeling Empire. This nation of militaristic ideologues has kidnapped the 64 delegates to the United Nations Conference on Peace and Child Rearing.

An ancient treaty between the United States and the Bungelings allows the U.S. to maintain a mail distribution center near where the hostages are being kept. You have smuggled an entire helicopter into the post office by disguising it as a mail sorting machine.

Suddenly you hear the sound of explosions. Looking out on the plain you see one of the Bungeling's barracks aflame. The hostages are running about frantically, desperate for a chance to escape. Bungeling planes and tanks are fast approaching lives may be lost. Your chopper is ready to go and fully armed - there is no time to waste.</desc>

		<name>Cyberball</name>
		<desc>After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.

Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.

Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives</desc>

		<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>

		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company. Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty. Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.</desc>

		<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

Starting out underwater, reach the top of the pond while avoiding dangerous alligators and fish (you can ride a turtle for safety!). Once on top of the pond, hop across logs, birds, and even a whale to the life preserver trailing behind a tugboat. In the third location you have to hop across a flock of birds to reach a cloud at the top of the screen. Each frog has a time limit to safely reach one of the homes on each of the three screens. You move on to the next level when a frog has safely reached each of the homes on all screens.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Games/Ghostbusters (USA, Europe).crt</path>
		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Games/Gorf (USA, Europe).crt</path>
		<name>Gorf</name>
		<desc>Gorf is a game that consists of five levels:
The first level called Astro Battles has the player's ship behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with the player's ship and shield on one side and the aliens on the other side; this level bears the most resemblance to Space Invaders.

The second level called Laser Attack is made up of a formation of ships, with some that swoop down and a laser that fires at the player's ship. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level.

The third level is called Galaxians, and as the name suggests it is very similar to the game Galaxian with ships constantly dive bombing the player's spaceship. This mission only appears in the Arcade version.

The fourth level called Space Warp, has the player entering hyperspace.. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view. One by one, alien vessels will come out and fly in a circular formation shooting at the player's ship with the players goal being to destroy each one.

The fifth and final level is called Flag Ship. In this level, the player does not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one which happens to be a large Flag Ship with a weak spot which is its core. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it, but the player must first shoot through a similar shield that the player had in the first level.

Finishing the game increases the player's rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</desc>

		<desc>Attack of the Mutant Camels (better known as Matrix: Gridrunner 2) is the sequel to Gridrunner.  In this Centipede style game you play a retired captain of a starship, one of those who had won the previous war against aliens.  You come out of retirement because the aliens are back, tougher than ever.  Thus a second gridwar begins.

You pilot your ship and shoot at chains of pods coming at you.  As you hit the pods, they break into smaller independent chains.  The aliens seem to have a sense of humor, though.  Each pod in the chain coming at you looks like a...camel.  Flying camels from outer space.</desc>

		<desc>The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</desc>

		<desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

		<name>Jack Attack</name>
		<desc>Jack Attack is a platform action game for the Commodore 64 released on cartridge by Commodore in 1983. A version for the Commodore 16 and Commodore Plus/4 was also released in 1984. The game was named after Commodore's founder Jack Tramiel.

Each level is laid out in a rectangular grid. The levels contain the player character, eight enemies, and a varying arrangement of blocks. The player's goal is to kill all the enemies without being killed by them. There are 64 levels in all.

The player character is able to push and pull blocks, which the player must use to kill the enemies and navigate the platforms. An enemy can be killed by being crushed either horizontally between two blocks or by the player character or a block falling down on it. On the other hand, the player character dies if a block or an enemy falls on top of it. Enemies are unable to push or pull blocks. Some levels include water, which is fatal to the player character, but safe to enemies.

While killing all enemies completes the levels, some levels also add bonuses for jumping on every platform. These platforms disappear after a set time limit and are usually only accessible by arranging the blocks in a certain way adding a puzzle element to the game. A time bonus is also awarded for quickly completing a level.</desc>

Further on, you've to form columns instead of popping them. These columns have a nasty habit by getting each time higher and will give you a lesser time to react.

However, if you're close enough to the balloon you can kick the balloon and try again. Another way is to catch the 'Pac-Man' that comes down between the balloons. This will eat the balloons that falls on your head. If you miss you'll fall from your unicycle.</desc>

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level.

		<name>Leader Board</name>
		<desc>Access' long line of golf simulations started with Leader Board. Hold down the fire button to set the pace, then press it for hook and slice if needed. Greens are sloped, so be sure to factor this in. Four 18-hole courses are provided, and a 4-round match can consist of any combination of these, with up to 4 players joining in. 

There are three skill levels - novice players just have to hit the ball at the right speed in the right direction with the right club. Amateurs must be precise with the snap, to set the desired level of hook or slice - conventional wisdom in golf is to work on eliminating it first, then adding it back in - while the professional level also adds wind fluctuations.</desc>

		<desc>"Le Mans" is a car racing game where you need to drive as far as possible in a certain time. By overtaking other racers (which partially have a bit of an unconventional driving style, which does not make it easier) without causing a crash, points are added to your account (1000 points per 10 cars). If you reach more than 20.000 points before the time has run out, you receive further time units and you can go on driving. Next to the normal track you need to master driving on ice, in curves, at night and on motorways. If you crash you need to drive into the mobile garage (PIT), which is at the left roadside, which costs you valuable seconds. Additionally the number of cars overtaken until now is set to zero.</desc>

		<name>Linking Logic</name>
		<desc>Help Buddy and Betty find a way through the building. Just link up a path from floor to floor - you have to think hard, and think some more!

Build bridges they can walk on and walls to help guide them. Use ladders to send them up and down, springs to bounce them all around. And make sure they pick up the missing tiles along the way.

Luckily, you have your own special helper - Billie the Bird - to carry walls and bridges to just the places you need them. If you plan carefully, Buddy and Betty will reach the bottom floor and you'll hear a special song!

Every game in LINKING LOGIC holds new discoveries. And there's always more than one way to build a path, because Fisher-Price knows that children need lots of room to exercise their imaginations.

Learning Value: Young children are just beginning to learn how to think logically and plan a series of actions. LINKING LOGIC helps them develop these skills in an enjoyable game format. It also aids pattern recognition by asking children to match up different shapes. Ages 4-8</desc>

		<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

		<name>Mastertype</name>
		<desc>MasterType is an educational game that teaches the player how to type with the keyboard. In the game the MasterType is a powerful wizard who is helping the player defending his command ship by using his laser like force. The command ship is stationed in the center of the screen and from each corner of the screen missiles are launched toward the ship. In each corner of the screen there is a word and by successfully typing in these words the wizard uses his force to zap the missiles. The command ship has four areas and when an area has been hit by a missile it's shield will be destroyed. If the same area is hit a second time the whole ship will explode and the game will be over. 

The game consists of 17 or 18 lessons depending on version and is chosen before the game begins. The first lesson deals with the home row keys (a to ;) and the player only has to enter single letters. As the difficulty increases with each lesson longer and more complex phrases needs to be typed in. Once a lesson is completed the player gets a summary showing how well he has done and whether further practice is needed. Some options exist to alter the game after the player's needs. A beginner mode can be turned on and it's also possible to set a speed goal (number of words per minute). In addition to the lessons included, it is also possible for the player to create his own lessons.</desc>

For example if the goal distance is 20 miles the player has to choose two +10 branches. The goal has to be reached exactly and if the mileage is larger than the goal the player will be rerouted and need to go through a branch that either subtracts or divides the mileage.</desc>

Fisher-Price knows that children like to do "grown-up" work, and that's one reason why helping the window washer of MEMORY MANOR is so much fun.

It's a big job! Your child has to plan the water supply so it doesn't run out. That means remembering which windows to wash - the ones with cats, flowers, or birds in them. And avoiding the windows with frowning faces, because they use up too much water.

Sound easy? It is - until the rain comes and smudges all the windows. Then your child will have fun with the challenge of remembering which window is which.

Learning Value: Memory is a skill that can be improved by practice and concentration. MEMORY MANOR will exercise your child's memory, while it encourages careful planning. Ages 4-8</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Games/Moondust (USA, Europe).crt</path>
		<name>Moon Dust</name>
		<desc>Moondust's gameplay is characterized by graphical complexity, and the game features an abstract ambient score. The goal of the game is to cover the bullseye at the center of the screen with "moonjuice." To do this, the player controls spaceman Jose Scriabin (named in honor of synaesthetic composer Alexander Scriabin) as he drops a seed square and then moves around the screen in arcing paths to run over the seed, smearing it to cover the bullseye. As Jose travels, flight patterns of he and the bullet-shaped spaceships he must avoid are created and as they pass through the trails that are created, and as the moonjuice spreads and smears, the musical score is modified according to a generative algorithm. In-game scoring system assigns point-values according to an algorithm when the level is completed. Players start with three seeds but may acquire more if they have scored highly enough.

The game features 4 modes: Beginner, Evasive, Freestyle, and Spinsanity. In Beginner mode, the seeds that Jose must smear remain in one position wherever they had been dropped. In Evasive mode, however, the seeds seek to evade Jose by rushing to the edge of the screen. Freestyle mode greatly increases the player's control over Jose, removing the physical element of momentum to connect Jose's motions directly to the joystick controller's. In Spinsanity mode, the spaceships travel in a spiral pattern making smearing of the seed more difficult for the player.</desc>

		<name>Motor Mania</name>
		<desc>Motor Mania is a top view driving game where the screen scrolls vertically upwards as you try to drive your racing car for as many miles as you can. Starting at a gas station you are able to control your speed up to 80mph, brake and move left or right as you avoid other drivers and various obstacles. There are three types of roads to drive on and they are motorway, b-road and dirt and you must avoid hitting the sides and drivers or you lose one of five lives. On the side of the playing area are various dials and these are speedometer, fuel which decreases as you drive, and generator which shows your battery power and decreases if you don't drive full speed. You can also see your mileage driven, lives and if you have your spare tyre. Obstacles you encounter affect different aspects of your car and these are potholes which cause your steering to be erratic, road patches which slow you down, avalanches which means hitting a boulder loses you a life, and you will also encounter crossroads with vehicles moving across the screen which need avoiding. Broken glass means you will stop and your tyre will have to be changed with only one spare tyre, and logs will damage your radiator causing your car to overheat. Gas Stations appear occasionally and here you can refuel, fix your radiator and increase your battery power.</desc>

		<name>Mountain King</name>
		<desc>Deep within a multi platformed diamond mine is a valuable crown. Your goal is to locate and retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

The loadout and starting positions are predefined, but you can change the loadout, choosing from two types of ammo, three types of rockets, explosives, first aid kits, transporters, and armor.

The game plays like a strategic third person shooter. You control the commander of the current squad, and can switch between the three. Also, there are computer terminals scattered around that can turn off some of the automated defenses and cameras.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Remix</name>
		<desc>The player, controlling a ninja, must fight his way through various levels populated by opponents, collecting necessary items in the process. Each level depicts a different locale and is divided into several screens. The game is presented in an isometric view and the ninja can move in eight different directions and jump.

Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There is a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they will instantly kill or at least severely damage them.

Various items scattered around the levels, such as keys, a rope and a map; collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game. There are also hamburgers that award an extra life when eaten.

The game continues from the aftermath of the events of The Last Ninja. With the Koga scrolls now in his possession, Armakuni has begun training a new order of shadow warriors. During a training session, he is mysteriously transported to 20th-century New York City. Torn from his own time, Armakuni must defeat the evil shogun Kunitoki once more.

The Last Ninja Remix re-release version has an added short intro sequence, minor graphic changes and a remixed soundtrack.</desc>

Players control a ship that can fire lasers horizontally and drop bomb vertically. The ship is also equipped with an energy beam that can absorb energy from energy tanks, and can also use that energy to create temporary shields around unprotected cities. The ship can also sustain up to ten blows in each round. If all four cities are destroyed or the ship takes ten hits in a round, the game ends.

		<name>Omega Race</name>
		<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game. You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>

Unfortunately, getting these items is not as easy as it sounds, as your task gets difficult by swimmers, swamps, snakes, turtles, and ants. To make matters worse, your energy gets depleted quickly, so to restore it, you can either return to your hut, or snatch food off an ant's back in later levels. More often than not, some of the turtles will follow you into the lake. If they enter the lake, you can run them over for 500 points before they decide to jump back out again.

Besides collecting items, you also must rescue swimmers that are about to drown in the lake. Fail to rescue a swimmer in a limited amount of time, and you'll also drown, and the same can be said if you bump into snakes. Rather than collecting items, you  can also roll on logs. Doing this will earn you 5000 points if you manage to roll for a long time. There are five levels of Park Patrol to complete, and once you complete all of them, the diffculty level gets higher and the game becomes much more difficult. To give you an example, the turtles will stop at nothing to kill you, and there will be more than one swimmer to rescue at once.

This game can have two players. Park Patrol even provides you with a menu, in which you can alter the number of turtles, ants, swamps, swimmers, and snakes in each of the five levels. With the menu, you can have none of these in every level, but what's the fun of completing a level without any enemies to avoid? Also, you can play as a boy or a girl.</desc>

		<desc>Peanut Butter Panic is a game for two players where your goal is to create peanut butter sandwiches! To do this, you need to jump up and grab stars from the top of the screen which can be used to power the sandwich machine. Some stars are too high to reach by just jumping; on either side of the screen is a spring board which can be used to launch your partner higher. After making sandwiches, you can then eat them to replenish your energy supply. Eating sandwiches also makes your character heavier which allows you to launch your partner even higher when jumping on the spring board. On some levels you need to watch out for Snarfs which will eat your sandwiches! The game ends when you run out of energy.</desc>

		<name>Pinball Spectacular</name>
		<desc>"Pinball Spectacular" is one of the first flipper simulations for the Commodore home computer C64 and VC20. The game was delivered on cartridge. A speciality is the controls by paddle, which is done in port #1. If no game is played, a demo is shown.

The flipper simulation is a mixture of pinball and breakout. The square-cut ball is rolled over the pinball table with the help of a double board similar to Breakout. As pinball elements, there are -next to walls- also two bumpers (upper right and left), the Commodore logo (in the middle of the screen), the light C O M M O D O R E with the corresponding targets, two spinners, four sideways ball traps (middle and bottom) and a point display. Furthermore, there is a time-sensitive ball barrier to avoid the ball going into out. The overview line with ball display, active player and points is in the first line of the screen. You have 3 balls per game.</desc>

		<desc>You play Pitfall Harry searching for the Raj diamond, his niece Rhonda, her cat Quickclaw and a variety of treasures somewhere in the Andes. Poisonous frogs, eels, scorpions, bats and other hazards get in the way.

Pitfall II is the sequel to Pitfall!, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter in the form of red crosses. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint. The score is reduced based on the distance travelled to get to the cross.

As he explores Harry can collect gold bars which give him a 5000 points award. His total score acts as an energy reserve. If the score is reduced to zero then the game ends and the player must restart from the beginning.</desc>

With a little luck, you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens if you can live that long!</desc>

		<name>Pitstop</name>
		<desc>Pitstop is an action racing game featuring six different race tracks. Your goal is to earn as much money as possible by winning races in the Grand Circuit which consists of a race on each of the six tracks; each time a race is completed, you'll earn money based on how you placed and the number of laps completed before moving on. While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.</desc>

		<desc>You are a mutant human, who by some freak of nature has the ability to shoot energy pulses from his body in eight different directions! Your job is simple: save humanity from their own creation -- the ROBOTRONS! The gameplay is pretty unique for the time. You can move and fire in any of eight directions. You get thrown in a room with various evil baddies strewn about, you've got to kill all the robots while at the same time finding some way to grab humans and avoid death.</desc>

Contact with the enemies en route (which are mostly mutant demons) drains your limited energy, and you are also working against a time limit on each section. As well as your magical powers (which are stronger in part two), you can collect swords to attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be collected to destroy all enemies on screen. In part two vanquished foes release coins, which can be spent at shop sections on rechargers, shields and teleporters amongst other things.</desc>

At the beginning of each stage, the aliens begin to drop from the sky. Your goal is to cruise around in your plane and to shoot them, preferably before they descend on a building, because then they will begin to crush it until it is destroyed completely.</desc>

You have a limited number of torpedoes and fuel units, so when you are running low be sure to watch for the green supply ship to release the dolphin that brings you fresh supplies. The enemies are varied and numerous. Enemy submarines pursue you below the water, and enemy destroyers on the surface can drop depth charges that slowly sink to the bottom and are deadly to the touch. You must also watch out for your own torpedoes, because there are certain ships on the surface that are immune to your fire and reflect your torpedoes back down at you. You can control your submarine with either joystick or keyboard.</desc>

		<desc>In Serpentine you control a multi-segmented snake in a maze; your goal is to survive and earn as many points as possible. At the beginning of each level, three enemy snakes will also enter the maze. To complete the level, you need to eat all of the enemy snakes. If an enemy snake has more segments than your snake, you can only eat segments that form the tail of the snake; a collision with the head is lethal! Each time you eat a segment, the enemy snake will become smaller until eventually you can devour it completely. For enemy snakes that have fewer segments than you, you can eat the tail segments or the head segment. From time to time, a frog will appear in the maze; eating this will cause your snake to grow. Both your snake and enemy snakes will leave eggs behind occasionally; left alone, these will hatch (your eggs earn you an extra life, enemy eggs will hatch another snake). Eggs can also be eaten to remove them from the playfield, so it's usually a good idea to eat enemy eggs before a new snake hatches! The maze changes for each level, and the enemy snakes progressively become larger and tougher to catch.</desc>

When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer; if you collect all solar cells before this timer runs out, you will earn bonus points and skip ahead a level. The game ends when you have lost all of your space ships.</desc>

		<name>Space Shuttle - A Journey Into Space</name>
		<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>

		<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>

		<name>Star Post</name>
		<desc>You are the lone defender of a starship outpost in a remote sector of our galaxy. Three-dimensional invaders tumble and plunge toward the outpost attempting to destroy you. Your mission is to defend the base against the invaders as they attack from 8 channels on both sides of the Star Post. You must also defend against a Superalien which disrupts your viewscreen as it spirals its way toward your Star Post.

There are 3 different game versions: Beginner, Advanced, and Hyper. You must maneuver your laser cannon in a circular or back-and-forth motion while firing on aliens. In addition, your outpost is equipped with a special SuperZap laser which eliminates all aliens currently on your viewscreen. SuperZap are added at the rate of 1 per level, and unused Zaps are stored for later use. Your Star Post can withstand only 7 alien hits per level of play. Each new level resets the number of hits to 0, but 8 hits in any one round destroys your Star Post.</desc>

		<name>Star Ranger</name>
		<desc>Star Ranger is a comparatively slow-paced side-scrolling Shoot'em Up. The player's ship can shoot in two directions, but the shooting frequency is rather low. Unlike in most other Shoot'em Ups, enemies do not simply fly through the screen and can be either destroyed or dodged. Instead, they stay onscreen, trying to destroy the player's ship until they are defeated. There are numerous different enemy types, each following a unique attacking-pattern. Some enemies try to close in, while others always shoot from a distance. There are also bombers, who fill the screen with indestructible bombs, as well as ships that can become temporarily invisible. To further increase the challenge, there are also passages in which asteroids have to be dodged or the ship has to be maneuvered through narrow passages.</desc>

		<name>Star Trek</name>
		<desc>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is a space combat simulation arcade video game based on the original Star Trek television program and movie series, and released by Sega in 1983. Star Trek uses both a 2D overhead map display and a 3D first-person perspective. The player controls the Starship Enterprise and must defend sectors from invading Klingon ships.

The player is presented with multiple views of the play field. Survival depends on the player's ability to effectively use and manage shield energy, photon torpedoes, and warp energy. These are replenished by docking with starbases, which sometimes must be saved from destruction at the hands of the Klingons.</desc>

In the first phase you have to pass swarms of TIE Fighters, including dogfighting the one piloted by Darth Vader himself. In the second phase the station's surface is protected by laser towers, third involves attacking its weakest spot - the unprotected exhaust port - with proton torpedos. Your X-Wing starts with six shields, but more can be awarded for good performance. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty.</desc>

		<name>Super Zaxxon</name>
		<desc>Super Zaxxon is a three-quarter perspective, space shooter style game. You must first go over a base on an asteroid. Things located on this base include gun implacements, fuel tanks, radar stations, missiles, and fighters. After you successfully navigate this base, you will go through a tunnel to tangle with enemy fighters, mine layers, and mines. You then will have to navigate through a series of barriers on another asteroid in order to take on the Super Zaxxon's, the enemy robot dragons. The game is very similar in appearance to Zaxxon. The differences are: Your fighter moves much faster. This makes going after ground targets a big challenge. The graphics are different. Although this is more of a viewing difference, it can still change ones perspective after they have gotten used to the Zaxxon graphics. There is no more outer space battle. Instead, you must go through a narrow tunnel to get to area 3. Instead of 20 fighters, you now have to tangle with 25 fighters in area 2. A new enemy, the Mine Layer, is introduced. As the name implies, this ship lays mines in your path. You can destroy the mines but it takes a few hits. Instead of encountering one Zaxxon robot, you now have to deal with three Super Zaxxon, dragon looking robots. The placement of things (fuel tanks, gun implacements, etc.) in areas 1 and 3 is different then in Zaxxon. There are now indestructible, elevated guns in area 1. These guns sit on the right side and they are 2.5 units in altitude.</desc>

		<desc>Tapper is an action game where you're a beer tapper (barman) and have to serve beer to demanding customers. There are four customers, each has its own lane lengthier than the previous one, whom you have to keep at bay. If they reach the end of the lane without receiving their beer, you're a goner; if you miss one and accidentally spill beer needlessly you lose a life and should one of them throw you back the mug and you fail to catch it, you lose a life as well.

Occasionally a bizarre icon will appear on one of the lines and, should you grab it, will invoke a "cabarette"-style show which will keep some of the customers occupied.

The Xbox 360 version includes bonus rounds, as well as co-op and versus multiplayer modes, also online, along with achievements.</desc>

To make things more difficult you have limited time in form of a fuel tank which will get refilled after you cleared a number of waves. Besides that, your spacecraft is equipped with a laser that tends to overheat. Every shot makes the heat bar of the laser increase a bit. Once it reached its maximum you can't fire anymore and are forced to wait until it cools down while slowly running out of fuel.</desc>

There are 6 'trash can' power ups per level that allow you to catch the enemies for more points. (Just like how eating a power pill will allow you to eat the ghosts in Pacman). The game maze features wrap-arounds both at the sides and top to bottom.</desc>

If you land on another car, you destroy it and collect points. You can also collect things like balloons and ice cream cones for bonus points. The faster you collect all the flags, the bigger a time bonus you get.

In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you will need to jump on it. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. Two player games are alternating with the players taking their turns.</desc>

The tank takes a while to steer, making it initially harder to avoid contact with those enemies. Each level contains energy stars, which can be traded in for upgrades such as improved weapons and extra speed after each level.</desc>

The player controls a "Worrior" who is trapped in a dungeon. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures which wander about the maze like corridors. The creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at the player, and some even have the ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.</desc>

The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

Large killer rocks, rogue satellites, boomerangs, and more all fill this region of space. Using your ships lasers you need to destroy as many of these as you can to earn points. Each level also contains some warp holes; enter one of these and you will be transported to a new location, which could be useful if you get in trouble. You will also occasionally come across some sonic sparklers; touch one of these, and you will temporarily become invincible. Another oddity you may come across is a super portal, which will transport you to the inner sanctum where bonus dots can be found.</desc>

		<desc>This is an early adaptation of the popular TV game show The $100,000 Pyramid.

The objective is to reach the top of the pyramid by winning successive rounds. Each round consists of selecting a category from the pyramid. Each category consists of a list of words that share some common thread like "things that are red". One player then tries to give the other player clues to guess the word without saying the word itself.

There is also a single player mode that does not resemble the show very much where you have to type in single word clues.</desc>

The story begins when agent Keene's boss sends him on one of two missions: to Vienna to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a famous professor, or to solve the mystery of strange self-replicating non-functioning fire hydrants.

While reading from page to page like a comic magazine you can interact with the characters when you choose what Keene should do or say; sometimes you even can take control over Keene to surpass action sequences.</desc>

		<name>Batman : The Movie</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1989-Batman movie. The game consists of five different parts, each resembling well known game types. Part one, the chemical plant: Hunt down Jack Napier who has raided the plant (typical platform action, climb ladders or use "Bat"-rope and shoot at some enemies...). Part two, "Batmobile" (...the car): Joker is chasing you and have to escape to "Bat"-cave. Avoid obstacles like police blocking the road and others. Part three, "Bat"-cave: A puzzle game where you have to find a certain item (belonging to Joker) amongst other items. Part four, "Batjet": Cut the ropes of the balloons which are filled with poisonous gas. Part five, the cathedral: Hunt down Joker. This part plays like the first one. Finally you will confront Joker in a fight that decides the fate of Gotham city.</desc>

		<name>Battle Command</name>
		<desc>Battle Command is a 3D arcade/strategy game, loosely derived from the same developers' Carrier Command. In a near future alternate reality, the Ultra War is fought between the two dominate races in the New World. The 'Mauler' is the latest technology - an Armored Fighting Machine capable of being lifted in and out of hostile territory by a fast Stealth Chopper, and armed with the most advanced weaponry science can devise.

You command a single "Mauler" assault tank in one of a series of scenarios. These range from a railway ambush to escort duties and a raid on a riverside hideout. Before starting you must choose the right weaponry based on the mission briefing.</desc>

		<desc>Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O 'Fun is a multi-event action game. The circus is in trouble: due tonight is the payment of a $10.000 loan to the Big Greedy Bank. The evening's performance must bring in that money or the circus will be seized. The bank does not play fair, though: they send the evil clown Fiendish Freddy to sabotage the acts.

The performance consists of six different events; High Diving, Juggling, Trapeze, Knife Throw, Tightrope, and Cannonball. There is a practice mode for single events, and up to five players can compete in the full game, but must reach the $10.000 on their own, not together. The money is awarded by a jury after each act.</desc>

		<desc>Galaga is a vertical arcade shooter from Namco. You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen, scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and to fire your own missiles to fight back!

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through. Every third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships. If that wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</desc>

		<name>Myth - History in the Making</name>
		<desc>Each level is centred on a certain location, such as in Hades, an Egyptian pyramid and ancient Greece, where the player must collect a magic orb in each to finish. Each level is based around related myths and legends. The gameplay consists of running and jumping through each level, collecting objects and weapons, fighting enemies and solving puzzles. Enemies include skeletons, demons, wraiths, mummies and vikings. Weapons include a sword, gun and fireballs. Each level contains a mythical boss enemy, such as Medusa, Thor and a Hydra. Puzzles involve using the right object in the right location to progress, such as throwing skulls into a pit of fire to summon a monster, and using the right weapon against enemies, such as attacking a specific monster with tridents. The user manual gave some background information about the various myths referred to in the game and gave hints to the puzzles. C64GS CART - At black screen, type SYS 3 MYTH with the spaces in uppercase. This will begin the game!</desc>

You control a succession of the USA's elite fighters with the aim of destroying missiles held by terrorists. You must destroy the missiles by placing bombs next to them and then fleeing the scene. 

You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on (neither of which fit with the film, or real-life logic, but make for Generic Ocean Film License #718). The gameplay is primarily side-scrolling, but the levels are taller than the screen.</desc>

		<name>Omega Race Max</name>
		<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game. You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<name>Pang</name>
		<desc>Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. 

Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 

You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.</desc>

There are red ones who chase after you, and black ones who are activated when you get close to them - both types kill you on contact. When they are close, you can activate a Star Screen to block them off.

The Radar of the title is on the right of the screen, and shows you where each piece of cheese is, although the actual maze is not illuminated, so your next snack might be further away than you think.</desc>

If you didn't destroy/kill enough, you'll be transported to a training mission, which is a first-person perspective shoot 'em up. Should you also fail the training, you must go to the beginning of the previous mission. Successfully completed mission or enough points scored by training allow you to proceed to the next stage. Unlike in the first RoboCop, there's no time limit, and you are able to jump.</desc>

The levels usually consist of several platforms, and are heavily populated by enemies who shoot at you. You can gather special repair kits, which will be used to restore your health after you've completed a level.

		<name>Shadow of the Beast</name>
		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</desc>

		<name>Space Gun</name>
		<desc>2039 A.D. Man begins deep space exploration in search of new life forms and usable fuel sources. What he discovers is trouble.

Until now, the success of past explorations was causing the space effort to grow by leaps and bounds. Until now, the explorers had found little more than fungus and small insects as alternative
lifeforms. Until now, the chief dangers had been 
those posed by the hostile environment of space. Until now, the aliens had not known about THEM.

On the ragged edge of the galaxy, other creatures that roam the stars discover humans and spaceships to be excellent sources of food and other resources. Prepared at the worst for clashes with rival exploration teams, the human crews can do little to
defend themselves as wave upon wave of nightmare
creatures descend upon their ships and bases.

In response to their distress calls, the Federation has assembled a series of rescue teams, lead by their best military sharpshooters, to deal with the alien menace. As the leader of one of these teams, you must gun down the intruders and pick up the human survivors. Brave the maze of dark corridors that may lead to a deadly shootout between you and legions of monsters. Pick up survivors and extra ammo on the way.</desc>

The story begins when agent Keene's boss sends him on one of two missions: to Vienna to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a famous professor, or to solve the mystery of strange self-replicating non-functioning fire hydrants.

While reading from page to page like a comic magazine you can interact with the characters when you choose what Keene should do or say; sometimes you even can take control over Keene to surpass action sequences.</desc>

The story begins when agent Keene's boss sends him on one of two missions: to Vienna to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a famous professor, or to solve the mystery of strange self-replicating non-functioning fire hydrants.

While reading from page to page like a comic magazine you can interact with the characters when you choose what Keene should do or say; sometimes you even can take control over Keene to surpass action sequences.</desc>

		<name>ACE : Air Combat Emulator</name>
		<desc>The AIR COMBAT EMULATOR, packed with exciting features, is by far the fastest, most realistic flight simulator available. For the first time on a home computer, feel what it is really like to fly a high performance military jet and engage tanks, missiles, ships, helicopter gun-ships and two types of cunning intelligent enemy aircraft.

Featuring over 300 sprite images, ACE has the smoothest most detailed cockpit view of hills, trees and other ground objects ever achieved thanks to specially developed Dynamic Graphics Technique allowing sensational high speed solid 3D graphics.

In combat, your head will spin as you struggle with the help of advanced avionics including rear-view camera and radar, to stay alive long enough to do some damage to the enemy.

The unique two seat flying option (pilot, navigator/weapons man) and Synchro Speech which passes vital aircraft condition information to the flight crew without freezing the action combined with dynamic tactical map, take offs and landings, summer, winter and night-time flying and a remarkably realistic in-flight refuelling option makes ACE the ultimate AERIAL COMBAT EMULATOR.</desc>

		<name>Action Fighter</name>
		<desc>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</desc>

		<desc>Set in between the SSI's AD&amp;D Dragonlance action games Heroes of the Lance and Shadow Sorcerer. This game follows the tradition of Heroes of the Lance with a side-scrolling, action-oriented view, a breakaway from the standard GoldBox RPGs.  Plot-wise, it also takes place between those two games, following closely the novel/game modules written by Weiss/Hickman.

You take control of one character at a time, with each hero having different abilities.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the later parts of the Dragonlance book Dragons of Autumn Twilight, the heroes descend into a ruined city in search of the disks of Mishakal.

The gameplay consists of horizontal fighting with a maze like map using doors to change the view.  The party consists of the 8 Heroes of the Lance, using one at a time and the player can switch between them at any time.  Each character has different types of attacks and spells making them more suited to fighting different enemies as well as acting as lives.

One of the AD&amp;D games that takes a break from the usual RPG style.</desc>

		<name>Hillsfar</name>
		<desc>Play a would-be hero in the city of Hillsfar, where action and adventure await the daring adventurer. Join the local guild and complete missions from the guild master in a quest for glory and gold!

Hillsfar is a "single-hero" role playing game (in comparison to other Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPGs, where the player usually controls a group of characters). A combination of 1st person perspective (when traveling in the city of Hillsfar) and 3rd person perspective (usually in some action-style mini-quests) viewpoints.

As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated mission-based plot: Thief, Mage, Fighter or Cleric. Each class, to a certain extent, has a different approach for completing quests.

In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various "mini-games" that are needed to complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons - Forgotten Realms Vol. II - Curse of the Azure Bonds (USA, Europe) (v1.3) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>Advanced Dungeons and Dragons - Curse of the Azure Bonds</name>
		<desc>Outside of the town of Tilverton, the party of heroes has been ambushed, captured and cursed with five azure markings called "bonds". These bonds have dangerous magical powers that can take control of the heroes at the most inopportune times. They must now search for the source of the bonds, and free themselves from the curse.

The second in the  Gold Box series of role-playing games, Curse of the Azure Bonds is a sequel to  Pool of Radiance. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor and other Gold Box games. Following the  AD&amp;D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Two new character classes (Paladin and Ranger) are added to the four basic AD&amp;D classes Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Cleric, which were available in Pool of Radiance. Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. There is also an overview "world map" that allows instant traveling between cities.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons and Dragons - Curse of the Azure Bonds</name>
		<desc>Outside of the town of Tilverton, the party of heroes has been ambushed, captured and cursed with five azure markings called "bonds". These bonds have dangerous magical powers that can take control of the heroes at the most inopportune times. They must now search for the source of the bonds, and free themselves from the curse.

The second in the  Gold Box series of role-playing games, Curse of the Azure Bonds is a sequel to  Pool of Radiance.

		<desc>The game's heroes arrive naked through a magical well in a frozen city. The group attempt to save the besieged city and fight to discover the secret of the Silver Blades...
The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games. The player must create a group of characters. Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, in first-person view. Battles involve the player-controlled group and the enemy group on a top-down battle screen. Commands are given on a turn-by-turn basis and player-controlled characters can navigate the battlefield freely. Unlike previous games, there is no world map travel. All exploration takes place in the 3D world.</desc>

		<name>ATF - Advanced Tactical Fighter</name>
		<desc>ATF: Advanced Tactical Fighter is an action-oriented flight game. The game is set during a war of two unnamed war parties over an unnamed island. The player mans an Lockheed ATF fighter bomber to win the battle.

The goal of every round is to destroy a number of strategic targets. The positions are shown on the jet's on board computer and the player can tackle them in any order. The game is action-oriented in nature, but the player still needs to take care of a few parameters, like a constant speed to avoid crashing or limited fuel and ammo. When resources or health are low (and the jet is near a friendly base), the player can start an automatic landing sequence to refill and repair. On the way to the targets it is either possible to take on enemy jets in direct combat or to fly low to avoid detection. The camera is fixed behind the jet's back.</desc>

		<desc>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

		<name>Agent USA</name>
		<desc>A story that could happen anywhere: The eccentric inventor Elma Sniddle experiments with a new TV machine, as she gets the fatal idea to use one of the confidentially-looking crystals, which had rained down from a meteor shower in her garden, as an energy source. But as soon as she had built in the crystal, the machine awoke to (of course evil!) life and shot at her with concentrated beam of pure fuzz energy which turned her into a distorted copy of herself.
Unable to grab a clear thought, she staggered out of her flat, while the sinister television ran away towards the train station to take its heels. Only by a lucky coincidence she stumbled upon another crystal lying around in her garden and by this quickly changed back to normal. Then she promptly informed Helena Aldente from the CIB about the case and she put the special agent AGENT USA on the chase for the Fuzzbomb.

Agent USA is equipped with a VERY big hat and ten of the mysterious crystals and a CIB passport, which authorizes him to get handed out free tickets for the trains at all ticket booths in the whole country. But he has to hurry, as the Fuzzbomb transforms more and more honest and tax-paying people into mentally deranged Fuzzbodies and soon the whole nation will fall victim to the Fuzz. It would be the end of the world as we know it!</desc>

		<name>Airborne Ranger</name>
		<desc>In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases:
Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.
2. Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.
3. Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s

Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).

Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.</desc>

		<name>Airborne Ranger</name>
		<desc>In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases:
Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.
2. Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.
3. Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s

Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).

Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.</desc>

Your task is to rescue 5 scientists from an underground lair by destroying its layer of protection and then getting to the core.  Moving onto a screen at a time you must shoot out anything and everything in your path, including lots of regenerating static targets. Realistic gravity takes effect, so you can't simply hover in a set position.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Alice in Wonderland (USA, Europe) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>Alice in Wonderland</name>
		<desc>Alice in Wonderland is an adventure platformer based upon the two Alice books by Lewis Carrol and created using the same engine as Below the Root. However, whereas that game had more of a focus on role playing, Alice has more of a focus on puzzle solving.

Puzzles come in a variety of forms including many inventory based puzzles, and more appropriately, given the subject matter, riddles. Also, there are many physical puzzles primarily taking the form of how to get from here to there through jumping and using inventory items to change Alice's size. 

The plot is more inspired by the Alice books than strictly adapting them. Especially the game tries to adapt Carrol's sense of humor in its rhymes and puns. Interestingly, Alice's end of conversations are driven by selecting emotions rather than typing words, and it is possible to anger NPCs and have them stalk off, leaving you to wait until a pre-appointed hour when they will reappear. The time can be discovered by looking at one of the various clocks throughout the game. Time is important because the game must be completed before the Red King wakes, although this isn't much of an issue especially since the game can be saved whenever and mistakes easily taken back.</desc>

		<name>Aliens : The Computer Game</name>
		<desc>Story: There are places in the Universe where you do not go on your own... but nightmares return and the only way to get rid of them is to return to LV-426 and face them. To re-experience the horror. To master the fear. And this time... to win. Here is your chance to live through the excitement and action of the film "Aliens" once more. Between the original landing of the Drop Ship to the end fight with the Alien Queen, the six different game sequences put the destiny of Newt and the colonial marines into your hands. . . .

Aliens - The Computer Game by Activision is the game for the movie. Seemingly, it was only developed for the US market, as there is another game with the same name in Europe. But this game differs significantly from the other concerning the game principle. The game talked about here was later offered by the same company in Europe with the addition "US Version".

The game has 6 levels. Almost every level can be assigned to a different genre. In Level 1 you need to fly through a course of rings, in Level 3 on the other hand you need to stop Aliens in Space Invaders style.</desc>

		<name>Alter Ego Female</name>
		<desc>Alter Ego is a game which tries to simulate life itself. The player creates a character with different personality statistics, either by assigning them randomly or by answering a few introductory questions. They then guide this character through seven life phases, from infancy to old age.

The gameplay consists of a series of situations where a decision has to be made. This is done by choosing one of multiple answer possibilities, sometimes accompanied with a mood. Then the player gets presented with the outcome and goes on to the next situation. Every decision has long-time consequences and influences the personality, health and which situations await further down the road. Some decisions may even result in an early death or instant game over.</desc>

		<name>Altered Beast</name>
		<desc>You are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive. The Altered Beast title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.</desc>

		<name>Alternate Reality II - The Dungeon</name>
		<desc>Alternate Reality: The Dungeon directly follows its predecessor: The player is still captured by aliens and imprisoned in an alternate reality. After visiting the city, now he proceeds to the dungeon with only one goal in mind: surviving.

While the predecessor was more about exploring the city, this instalment has a largely linear path - the dungeon consists of four levels which have to be visited in order. But the surroundings don't mean that there are only monsters to fight in the turn-based combat system or treasure to loot: the player still has the shops, e.g. an inn or a smithy, to his disposal. Even the six guilds (plus two additional ones) found their way into the dungeon; this time the player even may become a member. An important change in gameplay is that all items have a weight associated with them - carrying too much is bad for speed and endurance.

The dungeon is separated from the city and after entering there is no turning back. Save games can be imported, but the player loses all potions but sixteen.</desc>

		<name>Alternative World Games</name>
		<desc>Alternative World Games is a sports game with eight extraordinary sports: sack race, boot throwing, pole climbing, running up the wall, balancing a pile of plates, jumping over a river, a pillow fight and pogo.

At the beginning of the game you enter your name (confirm with "Return"). Of course here you can play for the country of your choice. For this you pick a record with the flag of your choice out of the LP box and a parrot, which sits next to it, takes out the LP with its beak and puts it on the phonograph (joystick forwards/backwards, then fire). Then the hymn is played. This can be repeated until the names of all players have been entered, to finish you press "Return" in an empty name field.

When you have entered all players you get into a screen, in which you can choose what sports you want to play. By moving the joystick forwards/backwards you set in the "video recorder" in the lower left corner the number of the sports event and press fire. Now a nicely animated picture of the sport appears in the corresponding screen. When you have chosen all your desired events you set to "9". By moving joystick left/right you can choose between "Compete" and "Practice". By pressing fire the competition or training starts with the previously set options.</desc>

This game is primarily a platforming game in which Spider-Man fights against various enemies. Those can be stunned with Spider-Man's iconic web substance, but touching them or other hazards in the game world will decrease his health. Another important part of the gameplay are puzzles, mostly with the goal to deactivate some of Mysterio's gimmicks, e.g. changed gravity, to clear the path. Spider-Man can climb walls and shoot grappling hooks.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Apollo 18 - Mission to the Moon (Europe) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>Apollo 18 - Mission to the Moon</name>
		<desc>Apollo 18: Mission to the Moon simulates a fictional mission to the Moon in the early 1980's, following on from the last real flight (Apollo 17) before NASA cancelled the program. One of the game's key features is digitised speech, which sounds crackly like a real mission controller would. Telemetry screens provide realism, with the player having to set items and computer programs to get the crucial GO signal.

The game is split into several sequences. First is launch, where pressing the button to stop a moving bar at the right point determines success. Course corrections and an orbital rendezvous (to undock the lunar module) are next. The player has to land the module safely on one of three possible landing sites before running out of fuel.

		<name>Apollo 18 - Mission to the Moon</name>
		<desc>Apollo 18: Mission to the Moon simulates a fictional mission to the Moon in the early 1980's, following on from the last real flight (Apollo 17) before NASA cancelled the program. One of the game's key features is digitised speech, which sounds crackly like a real mission controller would. Telemetry screens provide realism, with the player having to set items and computer programs to get the crucial GO signal.

The game is split into several sequences. First is launch, where pressing the button to stop a moving bar at the right point determines success. Course corrections and an orbital rendezvous (to undock the lunar module) are next. The player has to land the module safely on one of three possible landing sites before running out of fuel. The moonwalk is next, and must be completed in a set time before returning to orbit. On the way home the astronaut performs a spacewalk to capture and repair a satellite.

		<name>The Arc of Yesod</name>
		<desc>In Nodes of Yesod, a monolith was discovered on the moon that transferred data vital to earth's security to an alien planet. After an attempt to destroy the monolith failed, it was transported to its creators the Ariatans. Now it is up to Charlie to travel to the planet Ariat and prevent the Ariatans from accessing the data.

Gameplay in Arc of Yesod is very similar to its predecessor. Seen from a side-scrolling perspective, Charlie has to explore many large caverns, filled with enemies and transporters, and find eight crystals that he hopes will help him destroy the monolith for good. To get rid of his enemies, he can once again control a device similar to the mole in Nodes of Yesod. Pressing up on the joystick releases a small sphere that can be moved across the screen (while Charlie stands still) and shoot at enemies. Once again, there are enemies that are immune to the sphere, including a spaceman who, when touched, takes away one of Charlie's crystals.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Archon (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Archon</name>
		<desc>The light and the dark side (or the eternal confrontation). A magical, mediaeval field depicted as an overgrown chess board becomes apparent in front of you. Inside this mystical area there are mythical creatures as e.g. unicorns, sorceresses, golems, wizards or fire-breathing dragons. If one of those creatures moves to another field, so its life energy changes depending on the colour of the field. If two opponents meet on one square, the playing field turns into an arena.

Your characters use their fantastic abilities to fight against banshees, goblins and wizards. They use spells, missiles and fists, they throw spears and fire. They even take over the look and the characteristics of the opponent. You will need all your skill, agility and intelligence to control and lead your side.

Your magic rises and diminuishes with the light cycle of the board. The same way the light changes, so your abilities change. You need to keep an eye on the time and portion your strength effectively.

Archon is a fight made of action and strategy, which is carried out between two oppositional armed forces, that consist of myths and legends. The light and the dark side consist of the same number of individuals and their strengths are roughly equal, but they are not made up of the same troup parts. Their goals are the same: every side exists to win. Either by destroying all the opposing armed forces or by conquering the five force fields.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<name>Army Moves</name>
		<desc>Army Moves is a one-player game which is divided into two parts. In part one, you drive a jeep and must avoid collision with other jeeps and being shot at by helicopters. Then, you fly around in a helicopter and the oject is to bring down airplanes without being shot at by the airplanes themselves, submarines, and any other ground fire. Make sure you land on the pad near the end.

In part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your way to the general's offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you'll receive a higher bonus.

Some versions have a high score table to record your achievements. The second section must be loaded seperately, using a code attained from completing part one, on some versions.</desc>

Trying to stop you are a variety of flying saucers which will constantly be chasing you around the planet. Your ship is equipped with lasers which can be used to destroy enemy saucers and the mega mines. Located throughout the space around Earth are eight shield depots; if you fly through one of these, you will temporarily become invincible. Your spaceship also has a limited energy supply; if you get too low on energy, it can be resupplied at one of the generators located in the four corners of the play area. When all of the mega mines have been destroyed, you will move on to the next, faster chase!</desc>

		<desc>Once you're committed to this Asylum, (TM) you'll never want to leave - but then you may not get the chance.

Hundreds of floors and hallways offer a possible escape from this bedlam created by Screenplay's own inmates. Smooth, scrolling 3-D graphics create an eerie sense of reality as you move through passageways in search of an exit. Fellow residents may offer assistance, but accepting advice is a risky business. Muscle-bound guards block your path-should you tiptoe around them, or fight your way through? Use of complete, complex sentences allows you to reason your way through the endless strange predicaments which will frustrate your efforts to escape.

Play Asylum. All you have to be committed to is having fun.</desc>

		<desc>ATF: Advanced Tactical Fighter is an action-oriented flight game. The game is set during a war of two unnamed war parties over an unnamed island. The player mans an Lockheed ATF fighter bomber to win the battle.

The goal of every round is to destroy a number of strategic targets. The positions are shown on the jet's on board computer and the player can tackle them in any order. The game is action-oriented in nature, but the player still needs to take care of a few parameters, like a constant speed to avoid crashing or limited fuel and ammo. When resources or health are low (and the jet is near a friendly base), the player can start an automatic landing sequence to refill and repair. On the way to the targets it is either possible to take on enemy jets in direct combat or to fly low to avoid detection. The camera is fixed behind the jet's back.</desc>

You must run to the vehicle initially, and will also have to manually remount if you fall off - all costing you more precious time. Careful use of the wheelies and jumps is crucial to completion. Each hazard must be taken at the right speed, which you'll learn through experience.</desc>

		<name>Back To The Future</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1985 time travel flick, Electric Dreams' Back to the Future for the Commodore 64 (and ported to the ZX Spectrum) differs significantly from LJN's version on the NES.

The player takes control of teenager Marty McFly; zapped into the past by an experiment gone wrong. To preserve Marty's future existence, the player must lure Marty's mother-to-be into spending more time with his father, while avoiding the school bully. These computer-controlled characters will wander the game areas and interact with each other according to basic rules - Marty's mother will follow him around, his father will avoid the bully, the bully will knock Marty out if their paths should cross, etc.  If left to their own devices, Marty's parents will not meet and his time will run out (indicated by a fading family photo).  

The game world consists of five distinct areas, each the size of one screen. A separate "hub" area scrolls past the entrances to these five zones. Each of the five areas holds a collectable item, with a different effect (attract, repel, or no effect) on each character. A skateboard can also be collected to travel across the hub faster.

The player must use their collected items to keep Marty's mother and father in close proximity, while also keeping the bully away.</desc>

		<desc>Back to the Future II is a collection of five arcade and puzzle games.

Based on the second installment of the popular Hollywood series Back to the Future, this movie conversion has Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel through time to stop their arch-rival Biff from changing the future. The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie's most memorable scenes:

1. Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge.
2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence.
3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys.
4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking.
5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set in 1955.</desc>

		<desc>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:

1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.

2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.

3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.

4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</desc>

		<desc>In this game you play the role of a barbarian who must navigate his way through dangerous dungeons. The game is played from a third person side scrolling perspective and also has platform jumping parts to it. The barbarian is controlled by using left and right on the joystick to move and up and down is used to scroll through the various commands at the bottom of the screen.
When a command is highlighted pressing fire will perform that action thus saving on extra buttons being needed to play. There are two weapons at your disposal. A sword which you start the game with and later a bow which is handy for long range attacks. There are many traps to avoid and various monsters who have different attack patterns.</desc>

		<name>Barbie</name>
		<desc>Barbie gets a phone call from her boyfriend Ken, asking her if she wants to go somewhere with him. Where Ken says depends on the current game being played, and can include going to the prom, going out to dinner, going to the pool, playing tennis, working out at the gym, or having a picnic. 

You control Barbie, and your job is to get her ready by going shopping and selecting dresses, swimwear, shoes, hairstyle, and other outfits. This can be done by stopping her car in front of a store and going in. You use the joystick to move the "hand" over the various items in the store. You can also select its color and pattern. Clicking on these will cause Barbie to wear it. If you change you mind, you can change into something else. When you wear something you do not need, there is no way that you can remove it.

One of these might not be relevant to the situation, so common sense should tell you what you really need. Once you are done with all of this, you travel back to Barbie's house where you can find out if you have the right outfit. If you did, then you are shown a picture of Barbie and Ken having a good time. Otherwise, you are faced with the next situation.</desc>

		<desc>The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight is a fantasy role-playing video game created by Interplay Productions in 1986. It is the first sequel to The Bard's Tale, and the last game of the series that was designed and programmed by Michael Cranford.

The game features Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style characters and follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, The Bard's Tale, also created by Michael Cranford. The Bard's Tale II takes place on a larger scale with an explorable wilderness, six cities, and multiple dungeons which give this game its dungeon crawl character. The game has new features such as casinos and banks, and introduces a new magic user called an Archmage, among other changes from the first game in the series.</desc>

		<desc>The small country town Skara Brae was enjoying a peaceful life, until an evil wizard known as Mangar the Dark appeared. Monsters have invaded the town, terrorizing its inhabitants. Mangar cast the spell of Eternal Winter on the surroundings, isolating Skara Brae from any possible help. Guards that were entrusted with the task of protecting the town have disappeared within one night. Only a party of brave adventurers can save Skara Brae and defeat Mangar. The Bard's Tale is a fantasy role-playing game similar to Wizardry games, with first-person exploration of pseudo-3D maze-like environments, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies. Unlike early Wizardry installments, the town can be explored physically, and parts of the overworld are accessible as well. Several dungeons must be explored before the player can tackle the final quest. Six character classes are available when the player is prompted to create a party of six adventurers in the beginning of the game: Bard, Hunter, Monk, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior, Magician, and Conjurer. The last two can be promoted when specific conditions are met during gameplay. The bard class plays a special role, possessing magical songs that improves the party's performance in combat and are required to solve some of the game's puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>Batman: The Caped Crusader is a combination of an arcade and adventure game. The game is played with a side scrolling view, with each new location opening in a new panel similar to the appearance of a comic book.

The game has two parts to it, and these can be played in any order. In A Bird In the Hand, The Penguin is back, and planning on taking over the world with an army of robotic penguins. In A Fete Worse Than Death, The Joker has kidnapped Robin, and it's up to Batman to save him.</desc>

		<name>Batman : The Movie</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1989-Batman movie. The game consists of five different parts, each resembling well known game types. Part one, the chemical plant: Hunt down Jack Napier who has raided the plant (typical platform action, climb ladders or use "Bat"-rope and shoot at some enemies...). Part two, "Batmobile" (...the car): Joker is chasing you and have to escape to "Bat"-cave. Avoid obstacles like police blocking the road and others. Part three, "Bat"-cave: A puzzle game where you have to find a certain item (belonging to Joker) amongst other items. Part four, "Batjet": Cut the ropes of the balloons which are filled with poisonous gas. Part five, the cathedral: Hunt down Joker. This part plays like the first one. Finally you will confront Joker in a fight that decides the fate of Gotham city.</desc>

Part two, "Batmobile" (...the car): Joker is chasing you and have to escape to "Bat"-cave. Avoid obstacles like police blocking the road and others. Part three, "Bat"-cave: A puzzle game where you have to find a certain item (belonging to Joker) amongst other items. Part four, "Batjet": Cut the ropes of the balloons which are filled with poisonous gas. Part five, the cathedral: Hunt down Joker. This part plays like the first one. Finally you will confront Joker in a fight that decides the fate of Gotham city.</desc>

		<name>Battle Chess</name>
		<desc>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. 

The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. 

Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.</desc>

		<desc>Battle Command is a 3D arcade/strategy game, loosely derived from the same developers' Carrier Command. In a near future alternate reality, the Ultra War is fought between the two dominate races in the New World. The 'Mauler' is the latest technology - an Armored Fighting Machine capable of being lifted in and out of hostile territory by a fast Stealth Chopper, and armed with the most advanced weaponry science can devise.

You command a single "Mauler" assault tank in one of a series of scenarios. These range from a railway ambush to escort duties and a raid on a riverside hideout. Before starting you must choose the right weaponry based on the mission briefing.</desc>

		<desc>This early simulation of "The Battle of the Bulge" uses a semi-realtime system for gameplay, consisting of 15 minute time-ticks and will jump to 7:00 AM of the next day as soon as midnight is reached. The game has a pause command, so you can examine the battlefield without pressure of time. Units are displayed as icons and represent a regiment, brigade or even division, each having a certain strength value. At the beginning the units are placed in their historical starting locations of Dec 16th, 1944.

Victory points are accumulated by destroying enemy units and taking cities. The game will end on Jan 3rd, 1945, showing the final points.</desc>

		<desc>What can you add to Battleship over the pencil and paper version? A computerized opponent, fairly obviously, as well as the chance to play without using up the earth's limited paper and pen resources. The possibility of cheating is removed as well.

Elite go beyond this by changing the shapes of the ships to be more Tetris style, and allowing these to be placed at each of the 4 main angles. A 'Salvo Fire' mode sees each player fire a succession of shots (each of your six ships gets four shots a turn until it's sunk), meaning that strategic play involves firing on a wide range initially in the hope of finding a ship, before homing in on the area in the next turn. Finally, there's an animated sequence for each go, which is depicted as an air strike. As well as standard two-player games, there's also a multi-player mode in which the winner's score accumulates until he loses, allowing for a “winner stays on” structure if there are 3 or more of you.</desc>

		<name>BattleTech : The Crescent Hawk's Inception</name>
		<desc>Jason Youngblood is a young cadet MechWarrior stationed on the Citadel of Pacifica in the Lyran Commonwealth. Jason is training hard to become a battle mech pilot, following his renowned father Jeremiah. One day, the Citadel is attacked by the forces of the Draconis Combine from a neighboring star system. Barely escaping, Jason teams up with a member of Crescent Hawks, a special unit established by Jeremiah. Together, they must find the other members, ready to face the new threat. This will be harder for Jason than for anyone else, for he is sure that his father was among the attackers...

BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception is a role-playing game based on the BattleTech franchise. The first part of the game is spent training in the Citadel, acquiring the game's currency and experience, and learning how to fight in battle mechs or on foot, using smaller weapons. Afterwards, the game follows a more traditional RPG structure: Jason explores Pacifica, visiting its cities, recruiting companions, and fighting enemies in turn-based combat.</desc>

The entrance to level 2 is an airbase called "Clark Airbase" where elite soldiers run and kick the player character in the backside and run off, then the player character takes to the air, and level 3 (Mindano Island) has foot soldiers that have been equipped with flails. The entrance to level 4 (Corregidor Island) is an airport with the elite soldiers, and then the player character takes to the air once more.</desc>

		<desc>Thor has completed his Quest for Tires. Now he must discover the Meaning of Life.
But it won't be easy. The Meaning of Life is hidden away; somewhere in a long maze of mountains.
Each mountain is covered with clams and Thor needs to gather 100 clams in order to pay the tolls and advance through each mountain.
The only way to Peter and the toll bridge is through the "real scary caves". There are lots of clams in the caves but watch out for stalagmites. Keep Thor's headlight sweeping back and forth for maximum clams.
Out of the cave, watch out for Grog, who saves clams from Thor.
Thor also has contend with rocks, potholes and pterodactyls (they'll eat his wheel) in his Quest for Clams and the Meaning of Life.</desc>

There are many obstacles in the way which Thor will need to jump and duck, including rocks, trees, rivers, lava pits, cliffs, and of course Fat Broad. When you duck, the character bounces up and down, so don't duck too soon. BC's Quest For Tires is a side scrolling action game resembling Moon Patrol in some ways, featuring characters from the comic strip BC.</desc>

		<name>Beach-Head II : The Dictator Strikes Back</name>
		<desc>Beach-Head II features the player pursuing the eponymous Dictator in several ways.

There are four levels in the game. In the first level, called Attack, the player deploys soldiers along a path with walls to cover him from the dictator's gun. The objective is to destroy the gun. The second level involves rescuing the prisoners from deadly obstacles by clearing them with a gun. The third level's objective is to escape from the area by flying a helicopter with the prisoners out of the dictator's fortress. Finally, the player and the dictator face off, on opposite cliffs, separated by water. To defeat him, the player must make him fall in the water by throwing knives at him. The Dictator tries to do the same to the player.

In one-player mode there are three skill levels, harder modes resulting in faster movements and the computer opponent using better artificial intelligence. In two-player mode, one player controls the usual side whilst his opponent controls the Dictator's forces.</desc>

The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occasionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to Forbidden Forest; the main gimmick was the "4-dimensional" gameplay. The background changed to reflect the passage of time, going from bright daylight to starlit night. The main character could also move in and out of the screen. Armed with a bow and unlimited arrows, the aim was to kill the terrible creatures of the forest to earn golden arrows. Dying reduced the stock of golden arrows by half.

The player aimed by moving the joystick while holding fire, which changed the elevation bars in the side borders. Releasing fire shot the arrow. Among the enemies in the forest level were Vermes (giant worms that burst out of the ground), Dragonflies, and Scorpions. When enough arrows had been earned, the player could choose to enter the caves. Here there were swarms of bats to avoid and kill, a multi-headed hydra breathing fire and the final bad guy - the Demogorgon, who had one weak point.</desc>

		<desc>Role playing comes to Infocom games in Beyond Zork, in which you must set up a new character or retrieve an existing one before you can start. Quite frequently in the game, the player is attacked by one of Beyond ZorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many monsters. Apart from the high semi-random fatality rate in Beyond Zork, there are random elements in both the make-up of the map and in the placing of certain objects and creatures each time the game is played.

The game is written in Interactive Fiction Plus and there are a whole lot of new features and commands at your disposal.The quest is to find the Coconut Of Cuendor.

Beyond Zork is a clever combination of an Infocom text adventure with a D&amp;D type role playing game. I am not sure that the combination works well. Nevertheless, the game is a must for all Infocom fans (the name alone should ensure that) for it is better than a number of their titles, particularly some of the more recent ones.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Big Trouble in Little China (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Big Trouble In Little China</name>
		<desc>In this tie-in to the 1986 John Carpenter movie starring Kurt Russell, you must thwart the evil plans of Mandarin Lo Pan who has kidnapped two green-eyed girls in order to marry and sacrifice them in order to become mortal again.  You play as 3 characters, one at a time, in this action platformer: 

- Jack Burton, a burly but bit dumb action hero who fights with fists and later with a "Bushmaster" gun.  Ammo must be found to be able to keep using it.

- Wang Chi, whose girlfriend along with Jack's has been kidnapped, uses Martial Arts and later a sword when found.  More swords will be needed as they will break after awhile.

- Egg Shen is a magician who has vowed to stop the ancient prophecy from coming about, and fights with magic bolts which can turn later on into more powerful lightning if magic potions are found.  

Each character has an energy status bar at bottom of screen represented by a Yin and Yang Symbol that slowly disappears but can be replenished by finding food.  A weapons symbol is shown if they possess it and magic potion symbol will give them extra strength if found.  You must alternate among the 3 characters to keep their status from falling too low and dying, and each has to pick up their own appropriate weapons.  They all can move forwards and backwards, jump, duck and attack at different heights.

They have to fight through several levels including the streets of Chinatown, where martial artist enemies await and gunmen that must be avoided until more experience is gathered. Further on, you go into the sewers where additional monsters must be avoided by jumping over them.  Then they will reach the rooms of the underground lair of Lo Pan where large-hat wearing elementals called Storms await.  The final battle takes place in the Marriage chamber where armoured warriors and the levitating Lo Pan must be vanquished in order to free the kidnapped girls.</desc>

		<name>Biggles</name>
		<desc>WE Johns’ tales of a brave World War 1 pilot were updated for a 1980s feature film, with a plot involving Jim, Biggles’ brother who lives in that era. Jim travels back through time to warn Biggles of a spectacular weapon the Germans have created, with the intention of changing history – for the worse.

The game is split into two separate games, and the first of these is itself split into three sub-games. The first of these is a side-view flight game, in which you must shoot down and dodge Fokkers who come at you from the right of the screen in your rickety plane, with a machine gun and bombs on board. Part two is set in modern-day London, and the characters must jump across a network of roofs in order to obtain a secret code. There are guards to avoid, and big gaps between roofs to avoid. The third part is a side-view game inspired by Green Beret, with a gun to fire at encroaching enemies, gameplay on multiple vertical levels, and grenades to collect. Lose a life in any of these and you will cycle back through them.

The second game is a more serious flight simulation however. A helicopter is beamed back in time for our intrepid hero to use. You must first go to the Allied camp to get the secret weapon’s location (and you will need the password from part one of the game for this), and then head to that location to destroy it and save the world.</desc>

		<name>Black Gold - Schwarzes Gold</name>
		<desc>Four oil companies (each of which can he human or computer controlled) do battle to dominate the lucrative oil industry, buying and selling oilfields around the world. You can choose one of four main goals, from topping the market in 3 years to total domination. Plenty of dirty tricks to help you are on offer, from setting fire to opponent's rigs to stealing the storage tanks which hold the oil in place. Private investigators can be hired to either prevent to prove these things.

Although primarily a strategy game, a few short action sequences are also included. These come into play when attempting to drill for oil (you can hire a specialist to do this instead, but the cost is prohibitive in the early stages), to build oil pipelines around those of your opponents, and to extinguish any fires opponents start on your rig.</desc>

		<name>Bloodwych</name>
		<desc>The land of Trazere was once ruled by the powerful and benevolent organisation of mages known as the Bloodwych. Governed by the Great Dragon, the Bloodwych kept the country in balance, protecting it from evil and leading it to prosperity. However, the second-in-command of the Bloodwych, named Zendick, turned against his group, banished his opponents to the astral plane, and began working on a mad plan to summon the Lord of Entropy. The player controls the champion of Trazere, whose goal is to stop Zendick and restore peace to the land.
Bloodwych is a 3D maze game in first person. The special feature of this game is the two-player split screen support.
Each player controls a group of four characters. The four basic classes are warrior, mage, adventurer and thief.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Blue Max (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Blue Max</name>
		<desc>For those who know nothing of World War I or it's heroes, this game is named after Max Chatsworth, one of Britain's Flying Aces.  Chatsworth's fame began in battle, when he was out on a reconnaissance mission, and his squadron was decimated by enemy planes.  The pilot survived, and in the process shot down seven enemy fighters.  He shot down thirteen more the next month.  For these actions, Germany offered their Blue Max medal to anyone who could shoot Chatsworth down—and Chatsworth got a new nickname—Blue Max.

As Blue Max, you go out on sorties—flying missions—attacking assigned targets.  Targets include bridges, buildings, enemy planes, tanks, bridges, anti-aircraft batteries, vehicles and ships.  You progress to new missions as you take out your targets.

You must drop bombs to take out the ground targets, and this action also represents a key danger for you.  Unlike the modern bombers that drop bombs on targets far below, early aircraft engaged in semi-suicidal bombing runs.  The pilots started at high altitude, then tipped the planes nose downward towards their ground-based target, and pulled up before they hit the ground.  In the middle of the dive and pull up process, they released the bomb.  There were problems of coordination, found in the game as well—if you time it wrong, or start too low, you will crash.

This game has aroused some controversy too, which supposedly caused it to be banned in Germany.  In the course of your missions, you end up bombing houses.</desc>

		<desc>You are Max Chatsworth IX, a direct descendant of Max Chatsworth of BLUE MAX fame. You have lived and breathed his legend, and now fate calls upon you to fight an evil so foul that he could not even have imagined it.

The FURXX empire has extended its iron hand to Earthbase Gamma IV, and captured it. The inhabitants who were not killed in that struggle, were enslaved and sent to FURXX conversion processors to be drained of their life force, so that the FURXX TimeMasters could extend their own lifespans. Having effected an easy victory, the FURXX now intend to invade all the earth colonies and finally capture the earth herself.

Your mission is to penetrate enemy defences, destroy their hoverfields, and finally destroy the symbol upon which the FURXX EMPIRE IS BUILT. And this must be accomplished IMMEDIATELY, for the fate of the world rests in your hand!</desc>

		<desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</desc>

You play as Nick, a motivated soldier (and Joe in 2 player mode) in search of a promotion.
You are therefore enrolled in the army, which imposes on you more or less difficult and varied tests. Some are penalizing and success is mandatory, others will be compensated by an additional traction test to make up for the defeat, some like arm wrestling do not impose any penalty. Among these events you will find obstacle jumping, shooting ranges, arm wrestling, fighting against the instructor, pull-ups and a beat them all sequence. The game is difficult, but the execution is quite neat.</desc>

		<name>Boulder Dash : Construction Kit</name>
		<desc>Rockford the Ant returns in another Boulder Dash adventure contains 15 new levels, in addition to the easy-to-use game editor. Players can build, save, and play their own levels. The software includes a feature to sequence your levels on a separate game disk.

All of the elements and hazards from the previous Boulder Dash outings are back: The fireflies, butterflies, growing amoebas, enchanted walls, and of course, the boulders. New features include titanium (indestructible) walls, growing walls, and slime that allows boulders and diamonds to drop through it at a varying rate.</desc>

		<desc>A bugfixed and remixed version of the original Bounder game. The player has to move the ball around between two bounces so it lands on friendly areas like grass or the main hexagonal-patterned floor. If it lands hazardous areas like spikes and sand, or hits the enemies which move around, one of the seven lives the player starts with is lost. There are beneficial squares though - arrows which keep the ball in the air longer or teleports which clear part of the game.</desc>

Brian must wander through 100 locations looking for the Crown Jewels and sit on the throne. Objects are scattered throughout each location, and Brian needs to figure out their purpose. Monsters – such as ducks, Daleks, Mad Scotsmen, and Turkish soldiers – roam each location making Brian's task of getting these objects difficult. Up to three objects can be carried at any one time, and they can be used to block the path of monsters or to make extra platforms. The objects do not fall when dropped, making it easier for Brian to leap across blank areas. Getting the correct objects in the correct places is a daunting task.</desc>

		<name>Bubble Bobble</name>
		<desc>Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

Candles, fans, and other obstacles serve to make little Bubble Ghost's task harder. Bubble Ghost is invincible, but the bubble is prone to bursting if it hits anything at pace. You have five bubbles before the game is over.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show (USA, Europe) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show</name>
		<desc>Buffalo Bill presents a collection of six Wild West themed mini-games, which hang together around humour-lead presentation and backdrops.You can play as many or as few of these as you like, and can always have another go at them if you fail.

First task is to throw knives at a spinning board upon which a surely-terrified and fortunately-skinny lady is locked  - make sure to adjust for the rotation that will occur in the time your shot takes to hit. You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two stages. First you must shoot the targets of criminals (but not innocents) as they emerge from the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they throw at you from over the horizon.

Event 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position yourself so as to be able to throw your rope around the poor cow's neck. This is followed by Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your balance to compensate for the Bronco trying to throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to balance two bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a joystick-waggling section starts. Last of all is a side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a stagecoach which has been invaded by Indians, and beat up the hijacker.</desc>

		<desc>The titular character of the game is a 1980s video game designer, Bob Morlock, who had picked "Captain Blood" as a nickname in tribute to the film starring Errol Flynn of the same name. Morlock develops a new video game about aliens and space travel. While testing for the first time his new project, he becomes warped inside the spaceship of the very game he had designed. Soon after, Blood is forced to go into hyperspace mode and, due to an incident, gets accidentally cloned 30 times. For 800 years, Blood tracks down every clone, as each one took a portion of his vital fluid. When the game begins, Blood has successfully disintegrated 25 clones but he needs to kill the last five clones who turned out to be the most difficult to track down or he will lose his last connection with the human species.</desc>

		<name>The Captive</name>
		<desc>In The Captive, the player is trapped in the Glen of Colored Corpses and must escape. Players starts in the town located on an island, and they are free to travel around the island. Locked doors are scattered around the island, and correct, color-coded keys, also scattered around the island, are required to unlock them. Also, one of the ?Messengers of Doom? will appear, move around, and then disappear. If the player touches one of them, then the game ends. Many items and scrolls are scattered around the island, and only three of these objects can be carried at the one time. Some of the items include a crucifix, a gun, a shovel, mushrooms, and an helicopter. Some items, such as the gun and helicopter, cannot be used until the correctly filled-out scroll is carried. When the scroll is carried and utilized, the scroll tells the player what item that they can now use. Pressing the Fire button brings up a menu, allowing the player to do nothing (if they accessed the menu by accident); pick up, use, drop, or stop using items; perform a special ability; or quit the game. Choosing to quit will cause the game to perform a count-down as confirmation. If the count-down is interrupted by the player, then the player is returned to the game. If the count-down reaches zero, then they are returned to the title screen. Food is scattered on the island, and eating food causes the player's energy to increase. If energy reaches zero, the game will end.</desc>

		<name>Castle Master</name>
		<desc>Castle Master is the fourth and final individual game to use the Freescape first-person solid 3D game system (after Driller, Dark Side and Total Eclipse). As a Prince or Princess armed with a slingshot, you have to explore a medieval castle to free your beloved from the evil Magister. 

Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. 

Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.</desc>

		<name>The Castles of Doctor Creep</name>
		<desc>So, your company has transferred you to their Transylvania office, and you're looking for a place to live? Something private, spacious, with a view? Well, we have just the thing for you. Welcome to The Castles of Doctor Creep!

Thirteen different models open for your inspection. Just step inside... Oh? You want to leave already? I'm afraid that's simply not possible... not until you have taken the complete tour.

The Castles of Dr. Creep is a platform game with a heavy puzzle element in the game. The game takes place in twelve medieval castles owned by the eponymous Dr. Creep, and your task is to escape from each castle. One or two-player game is possible, allowing collaborative gaming for solving the puzzles.</desc>

		<name>Hexenkueche</name>
		<desc>Playing a witch, you must assemble the six ingredients required to kill off your arch-rival, an evil pumpkin. The ingredients are all located in underground buildings, each of which can only be entered once you've found the appropriate key. The keys are located overground, and you must fly around on your broom to collect them.

The overground sections play like standard shoot 'em ups, as your broom is not affected by gravity and can fire bullets using your magic energy. Bats, fireballs and even seagulls are among the many creatures trying to stop you - contact will cost you more energy than shooting at them would. There are energy recharges on offer.

Once you go underground, the gameplay becomes a test of precision platform jumping, including some Manic Miner-esque blind jumps. The six underground sections can be completed in a variety of orders, but you will sometimes reach points that cna't be completed without objects from other sections, so a lot of back-tracking is required. Although you start with nine lives, they won't last all that long at first.</desc>

		<name>Cauldron II : The Pumpkin Strikes Back</name>
		<desc>An evil witch has brought evil and darkness to the enchanted wood, wiping out all but 1 of the innocent pumpkins. As the poem in the instructions sheet explains, the only way to put things right is to capture a lock of her hair, then take it to the cauldron and cast a spell to undo things.

Controlling the pumpkin is difficult at first, as it has a very high bounce, the exact level of which can be toggled using the 5 key. Direction can only be changed when the ball is on the ground. Ricocheting into enemies costs energy, and you only gain weaponry by landing into magic pools. The starting positions are random, making mapping advisable and increasing the initial challenge.</desc>

		<name>Choplifter!</name>
		<desc>In the area which lies a few miles east of Patagonia and to the south of Kurdistan lies the Bungeling Empire. This nation of militaristic ideologues has kidnapped the 64 delegates to the United Nations Conference on Peace and Child Rearing.

An ancient treaty between the United States and the Bungelings allows the U.S. to maintain a mail distribution center near where the hostages are being kept. You have smuggled an entire helicopter into the post office by disguising it as a mail sorting machine.

Suddenly you hear the sound of explosions. Looking out on the plain you see one of the Bungeling's barracks aflame. The hostages are running about frantically, desperate for a chance to escape. Bungeling planes and tanks are fast approaching lives may be lost. Your chopper is ready to go and fully armed - there is no time to waste.</desc>

You can do different things with the planes, from racing against a computer opponent, to practising formation and stunt flights. You can follow the testing and development programme through its evolution.

There is a "black box recorder" to replay your flights, and analysis of your performance compared to an ideal one.</desc>

		<name>Citadel</name>
		<desc>Citadel is a comparatively slow-paced shooter that emphasizes planning and careful movement over fast reflexes.

On a planet that was thought to be uninhabited, an underground city complex has been discovered. The player's task is to explore this city with a remote-controlled hoverdrone, called Monitor, while trying to avoid its automatic defense systems.

Monitor is controlled from a top-down perspective and can only be moved into four directions, holding down the fire-button enables it to shoot in eight directions. There are various stationary and moving enemies that activate when Monitor gets close enough and start shooting when it moves. Some can shoot in four, others in eight directions, while others only try to ram the monitor or attack with homing shots.</desc>

In order to shut down the factory, Thing must travel through the factory's 11 different levels and  collect the tape, floppy disk, listing paper and ROM chip scattered throughout.

The levels are filled with slopes, conveyor belts, interconnected pipework (years before Sonic the Hedgehog), and lots of foes to avoid. Question mark times have variable effects: stepping onto them reveals bonus points, objects, or a large weight that squashes Thing flat. 

As Thing takes damage from enemies or weights, his oil level is reduced. When Thing runs out of oil, he becomes rusted and the game ends. To move between levels, Thing must enter the pipework through a vent and bounce around the pipes to find an exit.</desc>

		<name>Combat Course</name>
		<desc>Lace up those boots soldier, and get ready for five levels of challenging action in this boot camp simulator. As make your way through various levels you'll be given points for doing the right thing and deducted points for any missteps. You can record your attempts and review them, to spot your mistakes and learn from them.
Level one is the Physical course, which requires you to jump over walls, jump trenches and crawl under barbwire. Level two is the Risk course. This one will have you planting dynamite and throwing grenades.
Level three has the player going hand-to-hand in the Combat course. The fourth level combines the previous three levels into one, and finally, the fifth level is a custom "Cobra" course that throws random elements from all the courses at the player.
To give the game replay value, there is a course construction set so that you can make your own levels. The Atari ST and Amiga versions contain digitized sound.</desc>

		<name>Combat School</name>
		<desc>Combat School is a Track &amp; Field type game, but with a military twist. 
You play as Nick, a motivated soldier (and Joe in 2 player mode) in search of a promotion.
You are therefore enrolled in the army, which imposes on you more or less difficult and varied tests. Some are penalizing and success is mandatory, others will be compensated by an additional traction test to make up for the defeat, some like arm wrestling do not impose any penalty. Among these events you will find obstacle jumping, shooting ranges, arm wrestling, fighting against the instructor, pull-ups and a beat them all sequence. The game is difficult, but the execution is quite neat.</desc>

Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</desc>

Aliens can be shot, but every other hazard must be avoided, as contact with them or falling into holes costs valuable time.

Time left at the end of each level is added to the score. Hit the white blobs on the screen to earn credits, which can be used to purchase power-ups or tricks, which last only for the next level.

		<desc>The inhabitants of the pretty but insignificant planet Blot decided to leave to find a trendier planet, and escape being called the Blotians, a most unhip name. Until they such a planet, they call themselves the Fuzzy Wuzzies.

Their colony ship collides with an asteroid, and crash lands in the Pacific Ocean, near an unchartered island, which they colonise, calling it "The Hippest Place in The Known Universe". Unfortunately the island is also home to rather nasty demons, who can't stand the commotion caused by the happy Fuzzies, or their silly name for the island.

The demons kidnap the Fuzzy Wuzzies by hosting a massive party, then capturing them in a net, and dragging them off to the torture chambers. The only Fuzzy not caught is Clyde Radcliff, who was already being sick in the bushes. He wakes up in the morning with a really bad headache, and fiery halitosis, and sets out to destroy the demons, and rescue his friends.</desc>

Before you play the main events you have to train in the gym. Weight-lifting, squats and sit-ups are included, which involve waggling the joystick as fast as you can to fill a displayed bottle of Lucozade (clever bit of product-placement there). The better you do at this, the better you'll fare in the events, which are predominantly waggling-based as well. They include the standard decathlon events of running, jumping and throwing as well as you can. There are four types of shoes available, and choosing the wrong one for the event will seriously hamper your performance.</desc>

This task is not easy, as en route you will face heavy opposition forces. Fortunately, you won't be a sitting bomber in the air. Your aircraft is equipped with machine guns (left and right) with unlimited rounds of fire power, so fire at will as the enemy approaches.

When the time comes, you will have to bomb the target manually. So, get ready to unload the cargo and give them hell!</desc>

		<desc>The Black Knight has brought misery to the land, and the end way to end this is to enter his haunted house to slay him. You are the brave adventurer taking on this quest through 14 increasingly-tough zones.

The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.</desc>

		<name>Dark Side</name>
		<desc>In Driller, the Ketars attempted to blow up the moon Mitral, but you stopped them. Now, they have Energy Collection Devices collectively known as EGOs, and hope to stock them up to use towards the Zephyr One device, and direct its energy at the planet Evath, resulting in a catastrophic radiation overload. 

Your mission is to beam onto their base on the moon Tricuspid, and destroy the EGOs. Destroying one will buy you more of your limited time. The problem is, many are connected to at least 2 others, and those can immediately regenerate, so you must tackle them in an order in which those with only 1 connection are attacked first.

You are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world viewed through the the Freescape 3D system, you roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and underground tunnels.

Gameplay has more action than Driller. The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle and make quick U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses energy at a faster rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.</desc>

		<name>Days of Thunder</name>
		<desc>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</desc>

		<name>Deactivators</name>
		<desc>Deactivators is an arcade-puzzle maze game which puts you in control of a squad of bomb disposal droids. You must pick them up and quickly throw them out of the building to safety - failure to do this costs you a droid and a room (occasionally blocking off other essential rooms). The game's levels have grid-like arrangements with doors, trapdoors and poles, and increase in size as the game goes on. For both these reasons, mapping is essential.

Security droids are on patrol, but these can be tricked into falling down holes. A computer room is the hub of your activities - this allows you to use teleports and turn off force fields, via the appropriate circuit boards which are hidden throughout the levels. On later levels the gravity isn't constant and you will find rooms with distorted directional senses, increasing the precision required significantly.</desc>

		<desc>Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior is a fighting game that supports one or two players. Players assume the roles of sword-wielding barbarians, who battle in locales such as a forest glade and a "fighting pit". The game's head-to-head mode lets a player fight against another or the computer in time-limited matches. The game also features a single-player story mode, which comprises a series of plot-connected challenges.</desc>

		<name>Defender of the Crown</name>
		<desc>Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</desc>

		<name>Deliverance : Stormlord II</name>
		<desc>The game begins after the warrior Stormlord's victory over the demonic invasion in the first game. The evil Black Queen is gone, but her surviving followers combine their powers and capture all the fairies again. Now, Stormlord has to rescue the fairies for the second time, fighting his way through six levels from the depths of Hell all the way to Heaven.

Similar to the first Stormlord game, there are fairies to free and monsters to mash all the while avoiding the platform traps. However, the game becomes more of an action sideways game. The game is divided into three levels divided into two sections each, with bosses and bonus levels in the end of each. All of the original's action-adventure gameplay elements are absent in the sequel.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Desert Fox (Europe) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>Desert Fox</name>
		<desc>Desert Fox is a strategy/action mix set in World War II. The player takes the role of tank commander Lone Wolf who has to foil Rommel's plans in Northern Africa. The strategic part of the game plays on a overhead map which shows Lone Wolf and Rommel's positions. The overall goal is to save the Allied depots which are attacked by Rommel's troops - the main challenge is to save all of them in time. Lone Wolf can be moved over the map and one airstrike per game can be used to buy time for one depot. Lone Wolf also has the ability to gain enemy intel with his radio - this is useful in order to find out where obstacles await.

Whenever Lone Wolf runs into one of these obstacles or Rommel, one of five action sequences starts. This includes tank duels, a turret section against incoming fighters, navigating a minefield, protecting a convoy and escaping an ambush. Those action sequences can also be played separately from the campaign. Lighting conditions change depending on the time of day.</desc>

		<name>Desert Fox</name>
		<desc>Desert Fox is a strategy/action mix set in World War II. The player takes the role of tank commander Lone Wolf who has to foil Rommel's plans in Northern Africa. The strategic part of the game plays on a overhead map which shows Lone Wolf and Rommel's positions. The overall goal is to save the Allied depots which are attacked by Rommel's troops - the main challenge is to save all of them in time. Lone Wolf can be moved over the map and one airstrike per game can be used to buy time for one depot. Lone Wolf also has the ability to gain enemy intel with his radio - this is useful in order to find out where obstacles await.

Whenever Lone Wolf runs into one of these obstacles or Rommel, one of five action sequences starts. This includes tank duels, a turret section against incoming fighters, navigating a minefield, protecting a convoy and escaping an ambush. Those action sequences can also be played separately from the campaign. Lighting conditions change depending on the time of day.</desc>

While an action/adventure hybrid using this license was released by Disney for the PC and Amiga, Titus also held a license to the movie.  This is a side scrolling action game, where you control Dick Tracy as he moves through five stages, shooting gangsters with an assortment of weapons.  Each stage leads to one of the mob bosses, until you ultimately capture the big man himself.</desc>

Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed.

As you play and get winning combinations, you'll have to choose whether to collect or gamble what you've won. After completing the fruit machine game, you'll get the chance to play a dice game where you have to guess if the next throw will be higher or lower than the current one. 

Dizzy Dice features two game modes. The first one you play as a normal fruit machine. But then there also is the bank mode, where you start with $20 and need to reach $100 to break the first bank. In total there is five banks, each requiring more cash to win. The game is controlled using the keyboard.</desc>

		<desc>Latverian president Dr. Doom is a terrible enemy, so when he hatches a plan to blow up New York City with a stolen Atomic bomb, one Marvel superhero is not enough to stop him. As the lavishly-drawn comic bundled with the game explains, Spider-Man and Captain America must join forces to go to Latveria and foil his plans.

The main action in the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you alternately control the two characters. They each have their own moves to deal with The Rhino, Electro and other foes. Moves are context-sensitive based on the distance between your character and the opponent. Energy bars decrease as you each take hits. After each section you get comic-book sequences as a reward, and to set the scene of the evolving story.</desc>

		<name>Donald Duck's Playground</name>
		<desc>You are Donald, working to earn money, which you then spend to buy playground equipment for your nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie to enjoy.

The first job is to guide the Amquack Express around a top-down map with 8 stations, setting the junctions to ensure that packages are delivered to the correct stations. His job in produce involves catching fruits as they are thrown at him and placing them in the correct basket. At the toy store he must sort items by shape and colour, and be careful with the security switch. His final job is at an internal US airport, soring products based on their location's delivery code.

The equipment for the playground must then be purchased and arranged, helping young minds get an appreciation of money management and cash-handling.</desc>

		<name>Donald's Alphabet Chase</name>
		<desc>Donald's Alphabet Chase is an educational game for children ages 2-5 featuring Donald Duck. Donald's alphabet letters have escaped and are now hiding throughout the house! You need to help Donald locate all 26 of the letters and put them back in place. By pressing a letter on the keyboard, an animation is displayed where Donald finds and catches that letter. There are six different screens a letter may be hiding on, and each letter features a different animation. When all of the letters have been collected, the game is over and a bonus screen is displayed.</desc>

One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon 2 - The Revenge</name>
		<desc>The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Wars</name>
		<desc>Dragon Wars takes place in the magical land of Dilmun, an island of salvation perverted into a world of horror by Namtar (as you might expect - the bad guy).

The player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with nothing more than.. well - nothing. Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). 
Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out).

Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based.

Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities.
Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.</desc>

The game, as one would expect from the long-running Dragon's Lair series, has mixed gameplay, including platform, puzzle and arcade (in the old-fashioned choose-your-path sort of way).

This first port includes two adventures: the first is to raid the lair of Singe the Dragon (hence the classic name) and rescuing Princess Daphne, and the second, in a sort of instant sequel of the first chapter, features Dirk trying to escape from the castle, now overrun by the Lizard King and its minions.</desc>

		<name>Dragon's Lair Part 2 - Escape From Singe's Castle</name>
		<desc>In this adaptation of the arcade classic you continue where Dragon's lair part one finished. Dirk, having rescued the fair Princess Daphne, decides to go back through the Dragon's Lair and relieve Singe of some of the gold that is in the castle which is under the protection of the cunning and lethal Lizard King. You will need lightning reflexes and judgement to fight the Lizard King and avoid the giant rolling marbles.

In this adventure you will be rushed down rapids in a barrel and sent down corridors on a magical flying horse and other dangerous deeds will present problems for you. Finally, direct Dirk to freedom through the realm of the mud monsters who come alive from the very earth itself to enslave Dirk and turn him into mud like themselves, navigate the dangerous terrain and jump across the chasm and freedom is yours.</desc>

		<desc>You are Amsel of Fandora.
Scientist.
Researcher.
And somewhat of a visionary.
Until now, you have led your life as a hermit. But a lot has happened, and your life has changed. You can no longer afford to seek the peace and solitude you once enjoyed. For there is much to be done.
But, you are not alone. You have your friend Hawkwind. He knows the terrain of Simbala, for he is the leader of that great country. And, in light of what has just happened, you'll need his help and guidance.
The Last Dragon has been kidnapped. The message came to you through the mystical Dragonpearl. It can tell of the past and predict the future. And though the image in the Dragonpearl is clouded with mystery, the message it conveys is clear: The Last Dragon is being held captive deep in the Southland of Simbala. Only you and Hawkwind can save him. The bond of friendship shared by the three of you permits you to do nothing less. It won't be easy. But then again, you and Hawkwind would struggle to the death to save the Last Dragon.
Dragonworld is the first fantasy adventure game written by the authors of a bestselling fantasy novel. You'll be able to travel through three vast and varied geographical regions. And all along the way, you'll encounter fascinating mysteries and dangerous challenges.</desc>

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. 

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</desc>

		<name>Druid</name>
		<desc>Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet. As the eponymous hero, your job is to destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels. 

The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. 

The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. 

On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. 

The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health.</desc>

		<name>Duck Tales - The Quest for Gold</name>
		<desc>This game follows the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie.

The aim of the game is shown in the introduction. Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.

Scrooge's office is your headquarters. Here you have three options – you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.</desc>

		<desc>Side-scrolling beat 'em ups in which you must rescue a trapped female friend are nothing unusual. Being able to use direct-combat moves as well as collecting bonus weapons, and food for energy recharging, is pretty typical as well. Games of this type that were converted from the arcade to home computers are particularly commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon series are famous examples.

Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin (and his red buddy Pin), and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Achacha's clutches.</desc>

		<name>Earth Orbit Stations</name>
		<desc>Earth Orbit Stations is a space program simulation where you run a privately owned space station. It focuses on the commercial aspects of space flight, as opposed to governmental or military aspects.

In the near future of the year 1996, you have been appointed space director. Your goal is to build space stations, conduct research, market products, and compete against up to three other directors. These can be controlled either by the computer or by other players. There are various missions with distinct objectives: the tasks range from rescue operations, pure research or space colony construction to a search for intelligent extraterrestrial life.

In the course of the game, you can build 39 different modules, including command, life, chemical lab, solar collector, and communications. Most of the missions require special units: for a Mars rescue operation, you first need to build a space hospital, for example. It's also possible to launch shuttles and probes from the station.

Reaching the goals of each scenario requires money. You can sell new products, request help from commercial sponsors, and even use ads to attract more buyers. To make this game even more challenging, you constantly have to watch your opponents, because if any of them achieves the goal first, you lose.</desc>

These can be practiced in Training mode, or taken on in a sequence of 2 of each in Competition mode. You must pass through the pairs of gates and hit the single ones, remain on the course, and avoid trees and spectators. Offences such as these will cause you to accrue penalty points, which will detract from your score. Up to 5 players can attempt these, with their results compared at the end.</desc>

On the road, there are many strange obstacles such as bouncing globes, spinning prisms, and airplanes that drop tall screens in your path. You are racing against the clock, so you must swerve around these obstacles because hitting them will force you to stop and cause you to lose time.</desc>

		<desc>A shoot ‘em up set on a patchwork-quilt coloured road, Eliminator puts you in control of a ship with a basic weapon, flying along at breakneck speed. There are barriers along the way to avoid, often set in quick succession, and lots of bad guys to shoot at or avoid - their shots must be avoided too. Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad. At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well. Tokens can be collected en route, and used to obtain better weapons, but losing a life costs you the best one you’ve currently got.</desc>

		<name>Elvira II</name>
		<desc>Elvira - a horror movie star, a witch, and your girlfriend - is in trouble. A demon Cerberus has kidnapped her in order to kill her and gain her power. To save Elvira, you arrive at the studios of Black Widow Productions, where she is being held. Unfortunately, the whole studio is filled with monsters, as the horror movie sets have turned real.

Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.).

For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the "room" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases.

As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve.

Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.</desc>

You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases.

As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve.

Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.</desc>

		<desc>Sury Ani 7 has been a source of mined resources for many a year, but now that it is contaminated, the only way to harvest its bounty is to do so remotely. Worse still, the security system of defence droids is active, and primed to damage anything which attempts to penetrate the surface. 

As such, you are in control of a Dedicated Disposal Droid in, which must eventually shut down the security system and clear the area of radioactive material. This is done by throwing it down the disposal chute on each of the 8 levels, but you only have limited time before they explode. Fuel is limited and must be found within the complex, with the retro-thrust move using it up particularly quickly. To reach the next level you must find the appropriate pass.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Extreme (Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Extreme</name>
		<desc>Your task in Extreme essentially involves wiping out alien pirates, across 3 distinct sections. This was essentially a spare-time pet project, so you would expect some of the most advanced graphics and special effects you'll ever see on a Spectrum.

The first level involves flying around in a ship shooting out aliens, with contact depleting your energy (and causing the screen border to flash). The second section involves travelling underwater, running into landmines to set off explosions to kill surrounding enemies. The final part sees you travelling through a  building in a huge droid, taking out everything in your path. The game is quite short, and would take around 20 minutes to play through.</desc>

		<desc>True to the aircraft’s flexibility, you pilot the F-16 in assignments as diverse as dogfights, bombing raids or reconnaissance missions. It is up to you to plan your flight route by setting waypoints on the tactical map prior to take-off; you can also (but need not) select the armament of your plane. When you have accumulated enough flight experience, you may command entire squadrons in the fictional Operation Conquest campaign, a simple simulation of an entire war theater that already hinted at what would later become DI’s Virtual Battlefield.

F-16 Combat Pilot allows multiplayer duels via modem or serial link.</desc>

		<desc>At the ending of Fahrenheit 451, former Fireman Guy Montag is a fugitive, wanted for murder for killing his supervisor and stealing contraband books. The game takes place five years later. A pointless war has swept across the country, leading to martial law by the Firemen. Now an agent for the literary underground, Montag makes his way to New York. His mission is to break into the heavily guarded New York Library on 42nd Street. The books themselves were burned, but the contents were transferred to microcassette. The microcassettes need to be retrieved and uploaded into the Underground's information network. Along the way, he discovers that Clarisse, the young woman who inspired him to rebellion, is still alive.</desc>

		<desc>The land of Fairlight no longer lives up to its name, its culture and society having declined over centuries. The former ruler's castle Avars is shrouded in mystery, and Isvar chooses to investigate it. Unfortunately, he finds himself trapped in a mysterious castle from which he must escape.

Viewed isometrically, Isvar's adventure features complex object manipulation: each object has its own physical properties and resultant characteristics in terms of how much else can be carried alongside it. The castle is guarded and full of trolls, who can weaken Isvar's energy - food and wine can restore it.</desc>

		<name>Fernandez Must Die</name>
		<desc>Fernandez is a despot who has invaded the Republic of El Diablo, bringing terror to the local people. The rightful leaders of the country have called you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring his country back to the people.

Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up.

On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at which you died in the last game.</desc>

The performance consists of six different events; High Diving, Juggling, Trapeze, Knife Throw, Tightrope, and Cannonball. There is a practice mode for single events, and up to five players can compete in the full game, but must reach the $10.000 on their own, not together. The money is awarded by a jury after each act.</desc>

		<name>Fighter Bomber</name>
		<desc>Strike Aces is a flight simulator designed to give players a feel for the quick decision-making process that real pilots need to fly. It takes place at the Strategic Air Command Bombing and Navigation Competition, a real-life event that occurs every year at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. The best aircrews from around the world and some of the best aircraft come to participate in a series of three missions that are constantly monitored, with points awarded to aircrews in various categories. In the end, the aircrew that has gained the post points receives the Curtis E. LeMay trophy.

In this game, you are the pilot of one of these aircrews with a choice of flying one of six aircraft, and your missions will pit you against any of seven additional enemy aircraft (although you will not get to fly them). To practice flying, you can do a Free Flight; when you're ready to compete, you will get to complete a series of 16 missions. You can also design your own missions, if you like.</desc>

To practice flying, you can do a Free Flight; when you're ready to compete, you will get to complete a series of 16 missions. You can also design your own missions, if you like.</desc>

This takes place in a side-view beat 'em up similar to Way of the Exploding Fist. Mythical winged and dog-headed monsters and half-human hybrids are your opponents, fought one at a time. You can duck and jump, and the weapon at your disposal can be used for high, middle and low strikes. Containers offering magical powers (both good and bad) can be found and unlocked.

		<name>Final Blow</name>
		<desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.

The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</desc>

		<desc>The King of Isbisima has entrusted you, Magic Knight, with the task of getting a present for his daughter. He sends you into the castle of Spiteland, which is overloading with treasures to uncover. Whether you return with them to please the King, or simply flee with everything you can get, is up to you.

Either way, the gameplay is platform-based, with enemies floating around to rob you of energy on contact. There are also scrolling mazes to move through. As you collect objects (often by using some of the other items you collect, to create chemical reactions of sorts and adding an element of lateral thinking), you must try to trade them for the most valuable items you can get.</desc>

		<name>Firefly</name>
		<desc>In the game, you, as commander of the Firefly, must destroy the 'mechanoid system framework' that your enemy has created by destroying its energy source.

The framework is represented as a grid of squares or sectors. Ultimately you must reach and destroy the power source, at the far right of the grid, whilst at the start of the game you only have access to the 'dead zone', at the far left of the grid, and those squares immediately adjacent. This can be extended as described below.

Planetary sectors are systems with planets in them, and cannot be entered as they are the enemy's main colonies, so are too well defended. Thus they block the path.

Unconstructed regions can be taken over, turning them into part of the dead zone, by bypassing the 'instrusion detection' alarm system. The system involves the cursor flicking between 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' symbols, and you must press fire when 'thumbs up' is displayed to take over the system. A thumbs down will scramble the squares on the grid.</desc>

		<name>FireTrap</name>
		<desc>A girl is trapped on the top floor of 16 burning skyscrapers, and as a firefighter, your mission is to climb up these skyscrapers and put out the flames that shoot through the building's windows, threatening every single floor. You'll also rescue other people trapped inside. Your mission becomes difficult by falling objects and fireballs, and even the flames shoot sparks in any direction at any time.

You can use the water spray on the flames to distinguish them. Doing so will occasionally reveal cash and other special items, which include: the 3-way water spray, which allow you to extinguish flames north, east, and west of you; invincibility, to make you invincible for a few seconds; and speed, which boosts you up several floors. 

You start the game with four lives. You'll lose any one of these lives by coming in contact with fire and falling objects, running out of time before rescuing the girl,  or getting the speed power-up when you are near the top of the building.</desc>

		<name>First Samurai</name>
		<desc>"The Demon King descends from his mountain domain to you, the First Samurai and your master. Defenceless against the Demon's magic, you succumb to his powers, leaving the your Master to fight the Demon King alone. Your master falls in combat, dying. But, with his last breath, he summons the Wizard Mage. The Demon King fearing defeat, escapes to the future. Tormented, the young samurai seeks the teachings of the Wizard Mage in the ways of magic. Boiled with revenge and armed with a magical sword, the young samurai follows the Demon King into the future and the unknown..."

The First Samurai is a platform action game very much similar to other platform games, but with a medieval oriental touch to it in addition to various unique features.

Arriving in the new unknown land, you are defenceless hence your fists and kicks. But as you journey forth, you'll find your trusty magical sword as well as throwing weapons such as knives and axes. With your martial art skills, your enemy best beware with those sudden moves that may prove fatal!

The First Samurai offers a wide array of weapons, special items and other objects. Combat is usually melee, either relying on your punch or kicks or using the magical sword to slash some pretty skillful blows in whatever direction possible.

Monsters are forever regenerating but food for health is plentiful. It actually takes an effort to be killed...</desc>

		<name>Flight Simulator II</name>
		<desc>This flight simulator simulates a real aircraft, the Piper PA-28-181 Archer II. For those with the knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics.

The game has more features than first generation flight simulators. Pilots are expected to pay attention to small details. SubLOGIC encouraged the players to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program. The game is oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there are options for laymen too: an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode. These modes do not require the same level of knowledge.</desc>

		<name>The Flintstones</name>
		<desc>The Flintstones is a game based on the popular cartoon series The Flintstones by Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc.

It's weekend! Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling  
with his friend and neighbor Barney.
Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the living room and Wilma is not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping.
And if that's not enough, Wilma also tells Fred that his mother-in-law is coming over.

The Flintstones game is divided in four parts.

Part 1: Painting the walls of your living room.
To go to the bowling alley before it is closed Fred has to paint  the walls as quickly as possible. To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living squirrel. 
Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts crawling around and starts scribbling on the walls. If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately starts wandering off. When Pebbles is back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel and dip its tail in the paint again.

Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling center.
Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to the bowling  
alley!
Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The road surface is dire and covered with rocks!
And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance.

Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney.
At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and the starting position of the player.
Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game  
takes ten turns. while a match takes three games.

Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site.
On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared!  Don't let Wilma find that out!
Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some  
scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her.
If Fred fails to rescue his daughter then Barney rescues her and Fred will be branded as a failure!</desc>

		<name>Football Manager</name>
		<desc>The football management game style has been one of the most enduring since Kevin Toms pioneered it in 1982. You start in the 4th division with the team of your choice, and can play on indefinitely in the hope of reaching the top division and dominating it, as well as winning the cups. Players can be bought or sold, with their transfer values varying according to the size of any bid. Their skills and morale vary as the season goes on, with resting key players in easy matches often a key move. You can take out a loan, limited depending on your division, while day-to-day bills must be covered. Matches feature short animated highlights sequences of key moments.</desc>

		<name>Footballer of the Year</name>
		<desc>Footballer of the Year sees you taking total control of the career of an aspiring striker with a Division 4 team, with the Footballer of the Year award the ultimate goal. You start with a small amount of money, which is used to buy goal cards; each of these sets you up a chance in a match. Up to three can be played in each game, making Hat-Tricks a possibility.

The action sequence is viewed from a 1st person perspective with the ball at the bottom of the screen and you either get a shot at goal or a penalty kick. If you have the chance to shoot at goal, you have the ball at your feet and you can move left or right before shooting. Defenders will come at you so you must move and shoot as quick as possible hoping the shot isn't blocked or saved by the keeper. The penalty attempt sees you trying to place the ball past the keeper. Fail to score enough goals and you may lose your place in the team; do especially well and you may gain a transfer up the league.

There is no arcade sequence for the C16 or the BBC Micro version, you just get text asking if you want to shoot to the left or right with text describing the outcome.</desc>

		<desc>In Force Seven, the player is in charge of a specially trained squadron which consists of seven crew members, all with different expertise. Their task is to infiltrate the energy production plant on the planet KARIS by rescuing any survivors and destroying any aliens that are holding them captive.
The player is equipped with a flame thrower which they can use to destroy the aliens, but caution must be taken so that they do not destroy survivors by accident. If the player spends too much time in a room, a green alien appears in their exact location. It is invincible to shots, so the player needs to get away as soon as possible. If the player comes into contact with any aliens, their energy is depleted. When the player has no energy left, the crew member they are controlling dies, requiring them to select another member.
Also in each room are supplies, and the player can stock up on more ammo, grenades, or health if required.</desc>

		<desc>Former boxing World Champion Frank Bruno, famed for his catchphrase "you know what I mean, Harry?" and more recently his heroic battle with depression, put his name  to this boxing game which replicates Punch-Out. As Frank, you must take on 8 progressively tough boxers to win the title.  

The action is viewed from right behind Frank in 3D, meaning that you can see and feel the full impact of punches. A full range of moves is provided, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard.

Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down.</desc>

		<desc>Playing a thoroughly drab, mundane and predictable character, your aim is to become interesting enough to reach the Pleasuredome. After discovering a gruesome murder, your interest in something greater than the routine of 80s Liverpool is awoken.

You explore the streets and houses in the search of a way out. The main basis of the game involves picking up objects and using them in the correct way - most objects have more than one potential use, and misusing them is the only way the game can be lost. There are several sub-games along the way, including shoot 'em ups, a maze and a jigsaw puzzle.</desc>

		<desc>The player plays Frantic Freddie, a telephone line engineer. Each level takes place on a single screen, each with five full-width platforms connected by telegraph poles. Freddie runs along the platforms; he cannot pass through the telegraph poles but may climb up and down either side of them. The goal of the game is to collect the pots of gold resting on the platforms, as well as optional bonus items which scroll through the playing area. Each level is patrolled by three to five monstrous "Greeblies" that Freddie must avoid, lest he lose a life.The game has a total of sixteen playable levels. The 17th level has a game breaking bug, as this level mistakenly has all poles removed. This means that Freddie can't reach the platforms above him, making this level impossible to clear. The player is forced to reset/turn off the system.</desc>

The game consists of 6 levels, on which you must obtain treasures  and - of course - a map that allows you to leave the labyrinthine pyramid alive.

You must avoid dangerous acid drops, mummies, spiders, vampires, etc. In order to defend yourself from those disagreeable enemies you have at your disposition a gun (with limited bullets), but some enemies are immune to guns, and you must jump or avoid them.</desc>

		<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<desc>G. I. Joe: A Real American Hero is a 1985 action shoot 'em up video game.

At the beginning of the game the player selects a one player or two player game. The objective as one of the members of the G.I. Joe team is to eliminate any threats from Cobra and to capture eight Cobra operatives. The game cannot be completed if too many members of either side are placed in jail, other members are released to perpetuate the game.

Two modes of play are used: overhead vehicular combat sections, where the player controls a member of the G.I. Joe Special Forces, and one-on-one fights with Cobra operatives. In the overhead combat portion of the game, the player could select one of eight Joe team members (such as Snake Eyes), to face off in combat against one of eight Cobra agents (such as Zartan). There are different geographical locations, such as woods, desert and arctic tundra. Each character had access to a vehicle from the G.I. Joe series, such as the Dragonfly helicopter, Rattler plane, M.O.B.A.T. or H.I.S.S. tank.

The one-on-one melee battle portion of the game featured sixteen characters available for the Joe team: Duke, Scarlett, Recondo, Torpedo, Snake Eyes, Roadblock, Spirit, Zap, Gung-Ho, Snow Job, Blowtorch, Stalker, Ace, Wild Bill, Steeler, and Clutch. The Joes were pitted against eight Cobras: Destro, the Baroness, Zartan, Firefly, Cobra Commander, Storm Shadow, Major Bludd, and Scrap-Iron.</desc>

		<desc>Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</desc>

		<name>Game Over</name>
		<desc>In a distant lost Galaxy in the immensity of the Universe, a gorgeous and evil woman had put under her with her intelligence and an immense army of Terminators of the five planet confederations located beyond Alpha Centauri. All the power of Gremla rested in the almost religious fidelity of her lieutenant Arkos; nevertheless, the intelligence of this Mega-Terminator of battle had evolved on the last ultraguarks in such a way that, finally, he left Gremla and he was united to the troops of the sidereal infantry, who commanded the general of the blue star Mc Killer.

As far as the game in itself, it's frenetic arcade divided in two parts, in which when it stops to arrive at second, you needed a key access that you obtained at the end of first.</desc>

		<desc>The Serena Commander have the mission to rescue his companion of expedition captured in Moon 4 of System Sotpok, better known like the world Phantis, an unusual place inhabited by a hostile fauna and exuberant flora.

Phantis is an horizontal shooter (R-Type like), combined with platform arcade levels (Turrican like). You have 24 different enemies to beat throughout 4 phases and 6 levels.

This program has two parts, recorded individually on cassette versions. In order to play the second, it's necessary to discover the access code, which is granted when finishing the first.That procedure was called FX Doble Carga (FX Double Charge), and designed to give more hours of addictive playing.</desc>

These seven events, modeled after the official competition, put you right there in the Canadian Rockies competing against the fastest and strongest athletes in the world.
Going for the gold takes endurance...
The easy part ends after the colorful opening ceremonies. After that you'll sweat icicles in the cross-country competition. Slice through ice in the oval-track speed skating event. And with burning muscles, you'll make a self-styled figure skating routine look easy.
...and daring.
You'll cruise the luge at 95mph with only a fiberglass board and some razor sharp blades between you and a rock-hard chute of ice. To get downhill to the gold you'll have to ski over 70 mph--without hitting any flags. And you'll taste the Canadian stratosphere as you freefall down a 90 meter ski jump, ride the wind and touch down on white concrete. Do it better and faster than anyone else and you've got the gold!
- Make history in seven amazing events: Downhill Skiing, Slalom, Luge, Figure Skating, Ski Jump, Cross-Country Skiing and Oval-Track Speed Skating.
- Unique camera-angle views capture your performance. And in the downhill event you can set up cameras all over the course!
- Opening, closing and awards ceremonies take place in the Canadian Rockies depicting actual pageantry.
- Up to eight can play at once, each competing for the country of their choice.</desc>

		<name>Gateway to Apshai</name>
		<desc>Turmoil rocks the land and the only salvation lies in the magic of the Temple of Apshai. Unfortunately the location of this temple has gotten lost in time. Furthermore, many heros dispatched to seek it have been slain. A legend speaks that only the blood of the greatest hero of Apshai's greatest hero will be able to reclaim the lost Temple of Apshai. Unfortunately this "greatest hero" has also perished. But all hope is not lost, for the wise man, Merlis has found the hero's son, whose blood is still able to fulfill the prophesy. With great haste, Merlis brings the youngster to the dungeon pits and leaves him to fend for himself. It is this youngster's destiny to find safe passage through the 8 levels, each of which contains passage to 99 different areas.</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet</name>
		<desc>Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet : The Deeper Dungeons</name>
		<desc>Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet III : The Final Quest</name>
		<desc>Gauntlet III is an action-based dungeon exploration game. Like in the predecessors you empty areas infested by all kinds of enemies while running for the exit. Like this was rather a straight forward thing in the first two games, it's not that easy to finish a level anymore. While you only had to run until you find the exit (and besides killing hordes of enemies you probably find some keys to unlock doors leading to deeper dungeons) you might have to solve a few "quests" to proceed to the next level in this installment. These "quests" are very basic, for example you have to find object A, then bring it to B, advance to C and finally go to D to uncover the exit. While the first two games had a top-down view, Gauntlet 3 has an isometric perspective. The old four characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkyrie) are ready for action again and this time they get backup by four new characters which include the Lizard, Neptune, Stoneman and the Iceman.</desc>

		<desc>This was the first of the two football games licensed around Paul Gascoigne, then the most expensive player in British football history. The game is viewed top down, and can be set to either move left-right or top-bottom.

League and cup tournaments are included, as are single matches and set-piece practice sections (you have full control of these). The gameplay involves a number of advanced moves, and includes a gauge to control the exact dimensions of a kick (height and curl as well as strength), if you can use it quickly enough. Unusually, you have control over the goalkeeper, so can only blame yourself when you concede a goal. The players each have their own skills and strengths, and these develop as the game goes on – if you play well, your players become better, and more capable of facing better opposition.</desc>

The game consists of 16 courses, which are marked out by giant suspended cones, each of which is to be completed against a time limit, while avoiding contact with the other planes. You must stay within the cones, any time spent outside it results in the alloted time ticking down at a prohibitively fast rate (so don't think of short-cutting the track). After every second successful race, you take on a bonus track, in which balloons must be hit for points.</desc>

		<name>Gem'X</name>
		<desc>Like so many other puzzle games of the time, this game involves tiles of different colours, which must be manipulated to clear a succession of increasingly-difficult levels.

The basic idea is that you are presented with 2 sets of tiles, and must make the left one identical to the 'control' set on the right. The colours are defined in a sequence - red, green, blue, purple, yellow - and when you click on a tile, that tile's colour moves forward by two in that sequence (for example a blue one becomes yellow), whereas the tiles next to it move by one colour (for example, blue becomes purple).

Any that move past the end fo the sequence disappear, causing surrounding blocks to drop. You get a limited number of moves, and limited time as well. Fortuantely there are passwords, delivered by cutely-drawn naked Japanese girls (although the private parts are covered up).</desc>

		<desc>This must be one of the earliest team sport games to use a first-person view – the packaging mocks the Xs and Os used to represent players in contemporary Gridiron games. What you see is what the player sees – control and viewpoint passes from the kicker to the receiver on a punt or kickoff, and the quarterback to the running back or receiver on a pass or kick. Releasing passes involves rotating the controls to select the pass direction. To take the ball, aim the visible hands in the centre of the screen.

There are 28 teams split into four divisions; their names are fictional (including the Seagulls, Mustangs and Geronimos), and each is rated out of 3 on 8 areas of skill. Matches last for 4 quarters of either 4 or 7 minutes' in-play time. Menus to select plays or teams involve using diagonal movements for selection. 

Standard Gridiron rules apply – gain 10 yards in 4 attempts (downs) without fumbling or having a pass intercepted; kick a punt or field goal if you are about to fail at this.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

		<name>The Goonies</name>
		<desc>The Goonies is based on the Steven Spielberg film of the same name, in which a motley crew of suburban kids in Astoria, Oregon, must save their homes from being foreclosed upon and find their salvation in a treasure map leading to an old pirate ship in a cavern. However, they must maneuver around an eccentric family of Italian criminals -- the Fratellis -- on the lam, who are also on the trail of the treasure.

The game is divided into a series of eight screens based on scenes from the film, each of which contains puzzles that must be solved by coordinating the activities of two of the kids from the Goonies (and in the last screen, the elephant-man-like Sloth) without getting killed by deadly bats, homicidal Fratellis, flying demon-skull thingies, or other environmental hazards.</desc>

		<name>The Goonies</name>
		<desc>The Goonies is based on the Steven Spielberg film of the same name, in which a motley crew of suburban kids in Astoria, Oregon, must save their homes from being foreclosed upon and find their salvation in a treasure map leading to an old pirate ship in a cavern. However, they must maneuver around an eccentric family of Italian criminals -- the Fratellis -- on the lam, who are also on the trail of the treasure.

The game is divided into a series of eight screens based on scenes from the film, each of which contains puzzles that must be solved by coordinating the activities of two of the kids from the Goonies (and in the last screen, the elephant-man-like Sloth) without getting killed by deadly bats, homicidal Fratellis, flying demon-skull thingies, or other environmental hazards.</desc>

		<name>Gradius</name>
		<desc>The people of Gradius are in trouble. The ameoboid Bacterions have launched an all out attack against the planet, and it's up to you to fly into battle and save them. Along the way you'll be able to power up your ship with hyper speed, force fields, lasers, missiles, double beam cannons and more to help you battle. Based on the arcade game, Gradius is a side scrolling shooter. Shooting certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your ship. Each level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating.</desc>

		<name>Graffiti Man</name>
		<desc>You are a graffiti artist who must get through four locations while avoiding all kinds of people that are constantly shooting projectiles or objects at you. These people include old men, police officers, skaters, and women that throw flowerpots on your head. If you come into contact with people, you will lose a life. When you get hit by a projectile or object, you lose one of your spray cans, and if you run out of these, you will also lose a life.

When you get to the end of each location, you will reach a wall where you can spray-paint on. If you spray over the specific regions, you will get rewarded for your effort. You are on a time limit on these sections, and when time runs out, you move to the next location.</desc>

		<name>The Great Escape</name>
		<desc>The Great Escape is an isometric action-adventure game.

Gather round, kids, and listen to grandpa tell of his time as a prisoner of war in Germany. ‘Twas back in 1942. Those were rough times, lads. Rough times. Been shot down in my plane. Darn shame it was, it being a good plane and all. Next I know, there’s this group of German soldiers standing round me, and off we go to a P.O.W. camp. Big thing, that, plenty of guards all around with a keen eye on your every move, and full of unfortunate souls like myself. Just that they do naught but sit all day and sob and generally be no great help when it comes to doing the Great Escape. But not me, no sir! I showed them Germans, I did, and I was out of their fashionable high security “he who comes here, stays here” camp in no time. You wanna hear that story? Bet you do!

Controlling a prisoner of war in a German camp, your goal is to break out undetected. There are numerous ways to freedom – back doors, cracked fences, even underground tunnels. However, you have to plan your escape while obeying the strict rules of the camp. 

Number one: Daily program. You have to attend two roll calls a day, one meal, one exercise, and stay in bed at night. Failure to appear at any of these events will result in the alarm being rung. When you do not touch the controls, your protagonist will move automatically, going to all important events. You have to detect and use gaps in the time-table to explore the camp. 

Rule number two: guard rooms are off limits. If a soldier catches you in a room that is forbidden, you will be placed in solitary confinement. Of course, you have to enter restricted parts of the camp to find items crucial for your escape. The moral flag will turn from green to red to indicate that you are in an area where you shouldn’t be. 

Rule no three: no prisoner may carry forbidden objects. When you are caught in a suspicious situation, you will be stripped of all items that you found so far. To avoid that, you have to deposit objects in a safe place. You need to find keys to open locked doors, uniforms for camouflage, flashlights to see in dark tunnels, and many more. 

Rule number four: guard commands are to be obeyed at all times. The German soldiers patrol on fixed routes and have a line of sight. You have to learn the guard’s routes and sneak past their backs to avoid detection when breaking out. If you are caught, your morale will decrease. If your morale reaches zero, your will to escape is broken.</desc>

You control Billy from a third-person point of view. On each level, your goal is to catch all of the Mogwai and return them to their cage (located in the upper right corner of the screen) and to destroy all of the Gremlins with a sword. Each level has a time limit - at 6:00 am when the sun rises. You move on to the next level by completing your tasks or just surviving until 6:00, although more points are awarded for the former. You will also receive bonus points for each Mogwai returned to the cage.</desc>

Unfortunately, Catheter gets word of your plans, and mixes up a whole new batch of vicious gremlins. As a result, your mission is now one of destruction and avoidance.

Elite's implementation of this is a five-level side-view action game, in which you run around avoiding or shooting the gremlins. Each level has a secret object which must be collected. Bonus items such as extra lives and time can be collected, as can improved weapons, and credits to spend on a new weapon after each level.</desc>

The game scrolls vertically, as you move up the screen shooting enemies, finding good strategic firing points and collecting powerups. As the enemy soldiers come towards you in groups, some care is required when picking them off, either using your gun or the grenades. There are also hostages carried by some soldiers, with points bonuses for not shooting these but shooting their captors. Each level ends with a boss.</desc>

The player starts each day at 0830 with a set quota of gumballs they must successfully sort through the day. Gumballs of different color are expelled from the machine in the top left corner, and they work their way through a series of complex devices to eventually be deposited from various slots at the bottom of the machine. The player controls the motion of various levers within the machine to control the pathway of the different colored gumballs. The player must then also move the colored carts at the bottom of the screen so that the correct colored gumball is deposited in each cart.</desc>

		<name>Gun Smoke</name>
		<desc>Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out.

Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a railway line.

On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.</desc>

On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.</desc>

		<desc>Gunship depicts the Western world's finest attack helicopter:  The AH-64A Apache.  This simulation recreates the weapons, flight systems, and performance of the real machine.  You control an arsenal that includes laser-guided Hellfire missles, a 30mm cannon controlled by helmet gunsights, clusters of bombardment rockets--even air-to-air missles for duels with enemy helicopters.

Gunship starts with flight training at a base in the USA.  Tutorials teach you to handle the copter; once the controls and flying skills are mastered, there are escalating challenges and hundreds of missions in any one of four regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Central America, the Middle East, and the USSR and it's Warsaw Pact allies in Western Europe.</desc>

		<name>H.E.R.O. - Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation</name>
		<desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

		<name>Hacker</name>
		<desc>Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</desc>

		<name>Hacker II : The Doomsday Papers</name>
		<desc>It begins innocently: you see a blank screen and hear the Touch-Tones of a number being dialed, then a few rings, an answer, and the scrabbling sound of computers talking to each other over a modem. You type in a logon name and find that you are in a telecommunications service called "Actisource." Before the main menu finishes, though, the transmission is interrupted, and you see a message from the CIA, who has contacted you because you are "the world's greatest hacker." They ask you to accept a mission of the utmost importance: to steal the plans for a Russian project called the Doomsday Papers, thereby thwarting a Russian attempt at world domination.
But, of course, there's more to it than that. The papers are in a guarded vault in a Russian military installation, with the pieces of the vault's combination in four locked filing cabinets, only one of which you have the key for. The CIA has smuggled three small robots, called Mobile Remote Units (MRUs), which you can control using your computer and a piece of software called an MFSM (Multi-Function Switching Matrix) Emulator.</desc>

Create a 3x3 box of these squares to release cocktails (of your own colour, so only you can use them) and top up your energy. Contact costs each player energy, but the player with a higher energy level can get up first. The aim to win a point is to trap your opponent inside a box of your squares.

		<name>Heart of Africa</name>
		<desc>January, 1890. The Africa of your imagination is about to become real.

BOOK PASSAGE TO ANY PORT: You have the thinnest of leads, the diary of a madman who disappeared hunting for the hidden tomb of a legendary pharaoh. You also have no time to waste. There are over 30 cities and settlements to visit, and you're not the only one on the trail.

SEARCH FOR CLUES AND EQUIPMENT: What the natives know will help, if you can get them to talk. The tools and goods inside their huts will help, too - shovels, canteens, canoe paddles, whips, ropes, machetes, guns, maps, gifts, and more. Just be careful. Not everyone will be happy to see you.

GEOGRAPHICALLY AND HISTORICALLY ACCURATE: Imagine a huge map of Africa stuffed into your computer. The Nile. The Congo. The Niger. Mt. Kilimanjaro. The Sahara. Lake Victoria. The whole thing. And if you get lost, just press the button. "The Nile River," the screen will say. What it won't say is, "about 2 miles above the falls."

AUTOMATIC MAPS AND RECORDS: As you explore, your computer draws maps and keeps a journal, recording the most important clues for later review. It also keeps a record of your last two, uh... misfortunes. "Lost incredibly valuable talisman while running from very angry rhino," it might say, or "Oops, better luck next time."</desc>

		<name>Hero Of The Golden Talisman</name>
		<desc>The town of the game's hero is under a curse from an evil wizard. He has stolen the Golden Talisman that had protected the city in the past. Broken into five pieces, the Talisman is hidden in a labyrinth filled with monsters. Now the hero has to find all five pieces of the Talisman and destroy the evil wizard in order to restore peace to the city.

The labyrinth is explored from a side scrolling perspective. It is composed of 64 room spread over five levels. Each room is 8 screens large, providing a total of 512 screens to explore. The goal of each level is to find a piece of the Talisman while fighting off lots of different monsters ranging from birds to jumping eyeballs to fire-breathing dragons. 

The hero can jump, climb ropes, swim and shoot as well as pick up different power-ups and objects. He can carry five objects, but only hold/use one at a time. Pressing the space bar changes the object in use. Usable objects include keys, ropes, lamps to light dark rooms, flags that improve the hero's firepower and others. 

Power-ups can be collected to replenish health or air. If the hero runs out of air, being underwater will slowly decrease his health. To help the hero finding his way through the labyrinth, a map is shown at the lower left side of the screen. It marks all visited rooms, shows his current position and indicates whether there are any items in a room.</desc>

		<name>Heroes of Karn</name>
		<desc>A long time ago, before the rise of the empire of Karn, evil creatures attacked the lands of Beren, the last of the Mountain Kings. Only four men, who would become known as the four heroes of Karn, survived the massacre and managed to flee. However, they were soon caught and put under a spell. The player takes on the role of the legendary Stranger from "a land where men can fly and machines can think", and must rescue the four heroes and retrieve the treasures of the realm.

Heroes of Karn is an Interactive Fiction game with graphics and more unusually, music. You can type in commands to manipulate objects, solve puzzles or attack enemies. While it is not possible to have conversations with NPCs, you can give them orders to do certain tasks.</desc>

		<name>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</name>
		<desc>You are Arthur Dent, an Englishman with a bad hangover wearing a dressing gown containing a much needed buffered analgesic and some fluff.  Your house has just been destroyed, followed shortly thereafter by your planet Earth (mostly harmless).  You’ve been rescued by your friend Ford Prefect, who’s not actually an out-of-work actor.  He has given you a book (The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy), a towel, and is now telling you to put a fish in your ear.  It must be a Thursday; you’ve never quite gotten the hang of Thursdays.

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is written by Douglas Adams and Steven Meretzky and based on Adams’ BBC radio series, television series, and the series of subsequent novelizations.  It’s one of the classic Interactive Fiction games produced by Infocom, labeled as Science Fiction and has a Standard Level of Difficulty.  Though divergent from the source material, the main characters, locations, and concepts are here.  Unlike the book, death can come quickly if Arthur fails to observe his surroundings, collect inventory, talk to people, and consult the Guide.  DON’T PANIC!

Original C=64 Grey Box Contents:
Megadodo Publications Advertising Booklet for your very own Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy complete with Fluff, Destruct orders for your home and planet, a nice red button with the words DON'T PANIC printed in large yellow letters, a pair of Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril-Sensitive Sunglasses, No Tea, and your very own Microscopic Space Fleet. All this can be yours, for the low, low price of only 59.99 Altairian Dollars.</desc>

		<name>Hot Rod</name>
		<desc>Hot Rod is a top-view racing game influenced by Super Sprint, in which three miniature cars race to complete a race as quickly as possible, by rotating, accelerating and braking at the right moments. You start with limited fuel, but more can be collected as you cover the track. Hitting hazards can cause your car to explode, thus costing time as it is replaced.

Unusually the racetracks are linear rather than lap-based, so each round involves covering a section of track once. After each race, you can purchase upgrades at the shop, depending on how much money you earned in the previous race.

Only part of the circuit is shown at a time, and this scrolls following the leader. If you fail to keep up with this, your car is moved forward on the track, with a penalty fuel deduction. This is slightly similar to the system later used in head-to-head games of Micro Machines, and is especially punishing while you are on roads travelling horizontally and the leading CPU car is travelling vertically, as it makes the margin for error much smaller.</desc>

		<name>Hotshot</name>
		<desc>A simple two-player game released to much marketing fanfare, Hotshot places you and another player (either another person or an AI robot) in an arena split down the middle into two save for a hole about half the screen's height for the ball to travel through, with a series of bricks on each side to destroy.

The aim of the game is to destroy your own bricks before your opponent can destroy his. This is achieved by catching the small by pointing your suction device at it and holding fire, and then releasing in the needed by letting go of the button. This is easier said than done, as the ball neither moves in a straight line or according to the natural rules of.gravity.

Should either player be hit with the ball and not catch it properly, they will be knocked down and possession of the ball is passed to the other player.</desc>

As Howard the Duck, master of Quack Fu, you need to make your way through the maze-like landscapes, and jump or fight the many obstacles blocking the path using kicks and punches. Water must be navigated around, because this 'superhero' duck can't swim. Or fly without the parachute you regularly use.

Quicksand, enemy mutants and more will all get in your way before you can finally parachute into the volcano and defeat the dark overlord! Howard the Duck is based on 'Escape From Volcano island', a cartoon featuring Howard, but was released to tie in with the movie of the same name.</desc>

		<desc>Some aliens from Venus have landed on Earth to live but have got more powerful so they have been put in gaol to stop them using their power for evil. The gaol wasn't built to keep them in but to stop people and aliens getting in to attempt a rescue mission. The gaol is starting to struggle to hold them so the aliens need to be destroyed. The only way to do this is by sending a team of droids in. The gaol is full of other creatures and defences all put in place to stop anyone getting in, these include Cannons, mines, electro wire and many types of creatures. There are three types of droids, The Brain, The Robot and The Xylon, each with different powers and abilities like switching bridges on, high fire power and teleporting. Once the droids reach a certain cell in the complex together they unite and become a 'Hybrid' where they are transported to a cell of an alien to destroy it. Once the alien is destroyed then they are transported back to the complex and another three aliens need to be found and destroyed to save Earth. The game is viewed from above and the Amstrad and Spectrum versions are flick screen while the C64 version is a scrolling game. The joystick or keyboard is used to control the droids and to switch between them.</desc>

		<desc>Six tough events await in this joystick-waggling action game. The full sequence of events is - swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery, triple jumping and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.

Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.</desc>

Players take control of an alien that has been captured by one of the human ships. Seen from a side-view perspective, the alien must find it's way through the ship, going through color-coded transporters, jumping over and dodging obstacles and blasting numerous enemies. Sometimes, defeated enemies drop items that increase firepower, replenish health or reverse the controls. Fellow prisoners can be rescued to gain extra lives. The main goal however, is to find a bomb that has been planted on the ship before the timer reaches zero. Once this is achieved, the alien can exit the ship and try to make its way to the inside of his home planet where an escape pod is hidden.</desc>

As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you.

The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progresses as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.</desc>

You have 6 hours to complete the game; 10 minutes are lost each time you die and 2 minutes are expended if you use the help function on your portable computer. The robots, rooms, and puzzle pieces are randomised when starting the game which provides replay value.</desc>

		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</desc>

		<name>Platoon</name>
		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</desc>

		<desc>As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary.

This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat.

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</name>
		<desc>The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy you must complete several cycles of the following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.
With every cycle the mine &amp; mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom</name>
		<desc>Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom is an Indiana Jones game that isn't based on a movie. Indy is looking for a lost civilization. He has to solve puzzles and traps left behind to get to the treasure and get out alive.

The entire game consists of only six screens all of which have monsters and puzzles guarding the exits. Not only will you have to solve the puzzles but first you must figure out what the puzzles are because no clues were left behind. The game's motto is: "Nobody told Indiana Jones the rules. And no one will tell you."</desc>

		<name>Superstar Indoor Sports</name>
		<desc>Four Indoor Sports are compiled in this entry to DesignStar's SportTime line of recreations. Ten-Pin Bowling, Air Hockey (not on the Commodore 16), Darts and Ping Pong (not on the European Commodore 64 releases) are featured. The menus and options screens have the same feel as Clubhouse Sports. Each game has computer opponents at multiple skill levels plus human-versus-human and demo modes, and matches can consist of varying numbers of rounds, with other options depending on the game.

Ten-pin bowling is played from a side-on view, although once the shot has been taken you see the results unfold from the bowler's view. There are three stages to taking a shot. Move the player up and down to line up his run-up, pressing fire to set the position. Then, do the same to set the angle of the shot. Finally, after pressing fire to start the run-up, press it again to time the release of the ball, as close to the line as possible.

Darts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels, and players can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length or provide a handicapping system. You can also set whether scoring must start or end with a double. Viewed from behind the board, you must first line up the dart, then set the dart's curvature and power by stopping a curved gauge on the right, then a rising power bar on the left. The view then changes twice - first a behind-the-player view to show the dart's approach, then a close-up of the board to show where it landed.

Air Hockey plays for five minutes, or until someone has scored 12 points. The view is above the pitch but angled so as to emphasize the goal at the top.

Ping-Pong features a handicapping system - six ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a closely-matched game. Again the view is from behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, the angle must be pressed at the same time as the fire button.</desc>

		<desc>Pandora's first game combines the Gauntlet style with the World War 2 setting, and specifically the Eagle's Nest building which is being used by a commander as his HQ. Three Allied soldiers have been captured, and you must infiltrate the facilities, rescue your brave comrades, destroy the building, and salvage as much of the stolen art treasures as possible.

There are eight levels to explore, each with a specific mission objective. Some of the paintings are loose, others are in crates which must first be shot. Explosives must be collected, not shot. With limited ammunition, guards everywhere, keys at a premium, and lots of strategic hiding points, an all-guns-blazing approach is less successful than a planned, measured one.</desc>

You walk around from an early first-person view with 90 degree movement and four views from each position, aided by a map. On the first level you must touch nine ghosts, to collect pieces of a key to know which of the objects you will later find are medicines, and which are potions.

While on level 2, you must visit information sites - you will need this to survive on level 3. These are guarded by spiders, which must be trapped and lured away using doors. To move between levels you must guide a mechanical lift, by moving the joystick in smooth circles from inside it. This final level contains familiar safe bottles as well as poisonous ones - all stored on hidden shelves. It also contains zombies to avoid or trap.

Before you can reach the emerald, you must solve a final puzzle involving hieroglyphs. Arrange a 4x4 grid so as to get the rows and columns to match, within 40 moves.</desc>

		<name>Ivan 'Iron Man' Stewart's Super Off Road</name>
		<desc>Enter the world of off-road racing as 4 vehicles will face each other, on a series of tracks which are based around flipped and reversed versions of a core selection. Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.

Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits.

Only your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races. Play alone or with up to 3 other players (depending on the version) in this classic arcade game.</desc>

		<name>Jack The Ripper</name>
		<desc>This game was made just short of the 100th anniversary of England's most notorious serial killer, who gruesomely murdered at least five women in 1888. After accidentally killing someone, you become a suspect. You must prove that you are innocent, without the police hauling you in as they search for a scapegoat.

Jack the Ripper is interactive fiction with occasional graphics, based closely on real events of the Ripper. The parser accepts full sentences, and instructions can be qualified with adverbs such as 'slowly' and 'quietly'.  The game is split into three parts, including digitised graphics (of the author's sisters) representing Ripper victims.</desc>

		<name>Jackal</name>
		<desc>The enemy army has captured too many of your forces. Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war... unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals...

Jackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your gernades (upgradable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you'll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress.</desc>

		<name>Jet-Boys</name>
		<desc>The discovery of rich mineral deposits on Saturn's moons has made our solar system one of the most hotly contested areas in the galaxy. An evil despot has bought one of the moons and installed a powerful reactor. Unless he is given control of all the moons, he threatens to blow up the reactor, irradiating all the minerals and making them worthless.

Enter the Jet-Boys, an elite security force protecting the Saturn system. Armed with their jetpacks and laser guns, they must now face the despot's organic and mechanical minions, enter his space fortress and destroy the reactor.

Jet-Boys is a horizontally scrolling scrolling shoot 'em up. The player takes control of a Jet-Boy and must destroy wave upon wave of enemy warriors across four levels. Power-ups fly across the screen allowing the Jet-Boy to upgrade his weapons, shields and gain extra speed. 

Every enemy destroyed counts towards a timer. At the end of each level, a boss enemy must be destroyed within the time limit gained during the level.

The can be played by two players simultaneously, each controlling one Jet-Boy.</desc>

		<desc>Aquatania has recently become the land of misfortunes, due to a group of plotting witches. The task of finding five charms and a magic bracelet to put things right falls on you.

And you need a change of luck, because events in this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it first. 

Jinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics title that takes a realistic world of people and situations, and then plays with the boundaries to create a strange and puzzling world. Characters are all getting on with their own tasks, and getting them to help you is usually a case of making sure something's in it for them.

Dialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but the most obvious way is not always the correct one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't actually die.</desc>

		<name>Jr. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of many sequels to the legendary "Pac-Man", Jr. Pac-Man features the character of Pac-Man's son. For the first time in the series' history, side-scrolling mazes were introduced, with each maze being two screens wide.

This time, the mazes have no exit tunnels through which players can make an escape. The bonus items that appear move around the maze and are now something of a mixed blessing, as not only will they destroy any Power Pills they come across, but they will also turn any normal dots they pass over into large dots that slow the player's movements considerably, but are worth more points than normal dots if eaten by the player. Any mutated dots in the maze will disappear if the player loses a life.

The Pac character is once again pursued by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Tim) in his quest to eat all of the dots in each maze. And, as before, numerous Power Pills litter the mazes that, when eaten, allow Jr. to eat the pursuing ghosts.

As with previous "Pac-Man" games, intermissions are featured between certain levels. Jr. Pac-Man's intermissions are episodic in nature.</desc>

		<name>Jumpman Junior</name>
		<desc>Jumpman Junior is the sequel to Jumpman and features similar gameplay with all new levels. As Jumpman, your goal is to disarm all of the bombs on the level before time runs out. Each level consists of a variety of platforms, ladders, and ropes you will need to jump and climb to reach the bombs. To make the game more challenging, a bullet will fire on the screen from time to time which will cause Jumpman to lose a life if hit. Each level has a different theme to it, and a few also have additional dangers as well. You will encounter deadly fires, the bouncing hellstones, moving ladders, disappearing platforms, and more.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Kaiser (Germany) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>Kaiser</name>
		<desc>Kaiser (German for emperor) is a political/business simulation set in 18th century Germany. Players take the role of nobles in the Holy Roman Empire and compete for the crown of the emperor. One to nine players can play, beginning by entering their name and gender and being assigned a state in the empire. Gameplay then takes place in turns, each consisting of a number of consecutive screens. In the first screen, players can sell and buy grain and land. Grain is necessary to feed a noble's subjects. Bad weather can result in harvest losses, making it necessary to buy extra grain to prevent starvation. Providing more grain than necessary increases population growth and the state's reputation. Acquiring more land increases population and is necessary for economic growth. Following the trading screen is a statistics screen, displaying births and deaths, immigration and emigration as well as income and expenses. The third screen allows control of income. Players can set taxes and tariffs and can determine how harshly the justice system works - setting it to a level that is too brutal might increase income in the short term but also lead to increased emigration. Another overview screen follows, displaying a player's lands and properties in detail. The fifth screen allows for spending the turn's income. It is possible to buy marketplaces and grain mills (both of which increase income) as well as construct part of a palace or a cathedral (both of which have no direct use but are required to move into the highest levels of nobility). Each building option requires owning a certain amount of land. Constructing five marketplaces and three mills results in the creation of a city.</desc>

		<desc>Kick Off is a two-player table football simulator. Each player controls a team of 11 figures which are ordered on four bars for each one (1 goalkeeper, 2 defenders, 5 midfielders, 3 forwards). You can control only one bar at a time. The ball is kicked by rotating the figures on the current bar left or right. Game length isn't time-limited but depends on the total number of goals scored. After four goals have been scored players will switch side and the game will last until another four goals have been scored.</desc>

		<name>Kick Off 2</name>
		<desc>The original Kick Off was expanded on in many ways for this sequel. The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).

Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Killed Until Dead (Europe) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>Killed Until Dead</name>
		<desc>Killed Until Dead is a sophisticated mystery game with a leaning towards humor. The player has to solve every aspect of a murder case before it happens. The five biggest mystery writers in the world have gathered together at a hotel and one of them will be offing another unless Hercule Holmes can crack the case.  

Gameplay is a cross between the board-game Clue and the paper-based logic puzzles in which the player must eliminate clues in sequence. To solve the forthcoming murder, you will have to search the suspects' rooms and confront them with the evidence and set the hotel's security cameras to record secret meetings. 

By questioning the suspects as to what they know about certain people, rooms and objects, they may reveal combinations they know will not be involved in the murder - perhaps if it involves the gun, the killer will not be Lord Peter Flimsey, for example.  However, there's a catch. If he accuses the wrong suspect, he might be the one who's Killed Until Dead - they don't take kindly to false accusation.</desc>

		<desc>Kinetik is an arcade adventure which features gravity, inertia and other real physics heavily. You control a round spaceship, which must be guided through the 44+ screens. Collect the letters P,A and X in that order and reach the end to win.

There are foes to avoid or shoot – some take objects you have but most merely drain some of your energy. Some walls can also be shot out. Some rooms have white spots which affect gravity and drag you inwards.

Avoid contact with red walls as these drain energy; all others are harmless. There are teleporters to help you navigate the game, and power-ups which remove the complex physics.</desc>

		<name>Kings of the Beach</name>
		<desc>The player can play as Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos. The features three modes of play; practice, match play and tournament. In the latter, you progress through five beaches (San Diego, Chicago, Waikiki, Rio de Janeiro, and Australia) filled with increasingly challenging opponents as you attempt to win it all. While Smith and Stoklos are joined by Ron Von Hagen, Tim Hovland and Mike Dodd as the only 'real' volleyball players featured in the game, EA spiced up the competition with some notorious characters from other games, including Hard Hat Mack and Lester from Skate or Die and Ski or Die. The gameplay controls for the console version are fairly simplistic, with the directional pad and two buttons doing all the work. In the PC version, players control three actions, bump, set, block/spike. Diving for the ball occurs automatically. The only 'advanced' moves in the game are the ability to dink or perform a one-handed Kong block (Stoklos' trademark). Another endearing feature of the game is the ability to 'argue' calls with the referee, which occasionally allows players to get a point overturned. However, if players argue too much, the referee may penalize them with a red card and deduct a point.</desc>

		<desc>Knight Games consists of eight self-contained small games with a medieval theme. Two are shooting games. The Crossbow event involves moving a crosshair so as to hit one of an array of rotating targets. Once you've mastered this you are ready for Archery - this time you must hit targets which move from left to right, so timing is more important.

The other six involve one-on-one combat. There are two sword-fighting battles against different backdrops; in each of them you must make 10 hits to get your opponent down, and do that 10 times to win overall. Time your jabs and shields to achieve this.

The other four events follow the same formula, but with slightly different weapons. The Quartermast event is on a log, although the action is still only 2-dimensional. Ball &amp; Chain, Axe and Pike battles complete the set. All can be played by 2 human players.</desc>

Once you've mastered this you are ready for Archery - this time you must hit targets which move from left to right, so timing is more important.

The other six involve one-on-one combat. There are two sword-fighting battles against different backdrops; in each of them you must make 10 hits to get your opponent down, and do that 10 times to win overall. Time your jabs and shields to achieve this.

The other four events follow the same formula, but with slightly different weapons. The Quartermast event is on a log, although the action is still only 2-dimensional. Ball &amp; Chain, Axe and Pike battles complete the set. All can be played by 2 human players.</desc>

		<name>Knightmare</name>
		<desc>Knightmare was a popular childrens' television programme set in a medieval fantasy world, in which 3 players guided a fourth through a maze using a virtual reality system. In the first licensed game you have been trapped in Damonia Castle and must somehow escape.

Viewed in 3D, you move your character around the rooms, while most other actions are activated using a verb-noun command system. By pressing the first letter of the first word (open, close, dig and so on) and pressing enter once you've got the right word, you can then choose the second word (options are context-sensitive; for example 'door' only appears if you stand near one). 

Plenty of puzzles must be solved along the way. Two advisers are present, one good and one bad, but each time you call for advice only one will answer, and you have to work out for yourself whether the clue is kosher. 

Your health is indicated by a candle graphic, the higher this is the healthier you are. You start without weaponry or spells, but these can be collected and used, including a rain cloud to freeze everything, Casper the magic key, and a cast-iron anvil to crush all evil.</desc>

		<desc>Kong is a clone of Donkey Kong. This is a single player game that can be played with joystick or keys. The aim of the game is to achieve a high score by rescuing Fay Ray from the clutches of King Kong. There are four levels in this game. In the first screen Kong rolls barrels towards the player who can smash them with a hammer to gain bonus points. The second screen is set in a pie factory and the player must hurdle oncoming pies on a conveyor belt. Level three has the player pursuing Kong up the sky scraper in lifts while avoiding falling girders and the last level is set in Kong's lair. Each level starts with a set number of bonus points which count down over time so the faster the screen is completed the more points are gained. Umbrellas and handbags can also be collected for bonus points.</desc>

		<name>The Way of the Exploding Fist</name>
		<desc>This menacingly-titled beat 'em up was the first in many martial arts titles from Australia's Melbourne House. Sixteen different moves are on offer, ranging from standard kicks to jumps, somersaults and roundhouse kicks.

The move executed each time is defined based on the character's direction, the joystick/keyboard positioning, and on whether the fire button is depressed, in a system which became standard on single-button control systems.

To win each bout you must score 2 Yin-Yangs - a perfectly executed kick/punch scores a full one, whereas a less forceful contact offers half a point - the best moves also offer more points. In the one-player game, you advance through a Dan by winning two successive bouts, and a single win for the opponent means game over. The champion in a two-player duel is decided by points after 4 rounds.</desc>

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.</desc>

You must choose which path to follow at OutRun-style forks in the road. The roads contain bonus tags including bonus points, a battering ram to make contact with other cars more effective, and energy boosts to replenish damage.

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Labyrinth (USA, Europe) (Six Sizzlers Compilation) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>Labyrinth</name>
		<desc>Labyrinth: The Computer Game is a 1986 graphic adventure game developed by Lucasfilm Games and published by Activision. Based on the fantasy film Labyrinth, it tasks the player with navigating a maze while solving puzzles and evading dangers. The player's goal is to find and defeat the main antagonist, Jareth, within 13 real-time hours. Unlike other adventure games of the period, Labyrinth does not feature a command-line interface. Instead, the player uses two scrolling "word wheel" menus on the screen to construct basic sentences.

Labyrinth was the first adventure game created by Lucasfilm. The project was led by designer David Fox, who invented its word wheels to avoid the text parsers and syntax guessing typical of text-based adventure games. Early in development, the team collaborated with author Douglas Adams in a week-long series of brainstorming sessions, which inspired much of the final product. Labyrinth received positive reviews and, in the United States, was a bigger commercial success than the film upon which it was based. Its design influenced Lucasfilm's subsequent adventure title, the critically acclaimed Maniac Mansion.</desc>

		<name>Labyrinth</name>
		<desc>Labyrinth: The Computer Game is a 1986 graphic adventure game developed by Lucasfilm Games and published by Activision. Based on the fantasy film Labyrinth, it tasks the player with navigating a maze while solving puzzles and evading dangers. The player's goal is to find and defeat the main antagonist, Jareth, within 13 real-time hours. Unlike other adventure games of the period, Labyrinth does not feature a command-line interface. Instead, the player uses two scrolling "word wheel" menus on the screen to construct basic sentences.

Labyrinth was the first adventure game created by Lucasfilm. The project was led by designer David Fox, who invented its word wheels to avoid the text parsers and syntax guessing typical of text-based adventure games. Early in development, the team collaborated with author Douglas Adams in a week-long series of brainstorming sessions, which inspired much of the final product. Labyrinth received positive reviews and, in the United States, was a bigger commercial success than the film upon which it was based. Its design influenced Lucasfilm's subsequent adventure title, the critically acclaimed Maniac Mansion.</desc>

		<desc>Laser Squad is by the same designer as Microprose's classic X-Com: UFO Defense. It brings to the table an immersive gameplay environment as well as many innovative ideas that weren't available in any other game of the time.

In Laser Squad you control a group of "marine"-like soldiers (and the occasional cyborg). Before taking them into battle, you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time.

There are 3 missions in turn - in The Assassins you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards, Moonbase assault challenges you to destroy the OmniCorp database, and Rescue From the Mines eschews violence in favour of a rescue mission. These are viewed from above and progress in turns. Laser Squad also features a 2-player "hotseat"-type gaming option.</desc>

The view is isometric and the ninja can move in four different directions (he can also walk backwards) and jump. The game is split into various levels, each of them depicting a different locale and divided into several screens.

The story follows on from the first game; with the scrolls now in his possession, The Last Ninja begins training a new order of Ninja. During a training session he is mysteriously transported to 20th-century New York. The Evil Shogun has returned! Torn from his own time, The Last Ninja must defend himself once more with nothing more than the belief in his own abilities.</desc>

The game takes place in various locations around town, loaded as separate scenes. The camera is stationary, and you control only where you aim the crosshair of your gun, which is used to either select dialogue options, or shoot at characters in front of you.

The core of the game is the conversations with different characters, and how you handle them dictates your success or failure. Gunfights are relatively infrequent, depending on your dialogue choices. However, you always have the option to start shooting at any time.</desc>

		<desc>Leader Board: Executive Edition is a release in the Leader Board Golf series following up Leader Board and Leader Board Tournament. The control of your golfer is the same but this edition has a few graphical and gameplay changes. Bunkers and trees have been added and there is a choice of two courses which you can play with three other friends supporting from 18 to 72 holes of golf. Like the previous releases you have three skill levels, novice (club selection and power of shot), amateur (ability to hook or snap shot) or professional (wind affecting shots). Before your shot you can adjust where you want to hit the ball and you can select which club to use. To hit the ball you hold down the fire button and when the desired power is reached on the power bar you let go. When playing amateur or professional, you have to press the button again when the moving power bar moves into the middle of the snap bar to hit the ball straight. To putt you have to hold the fire button on a power bar and let go when you have reached the desired amount of power.</desc>

The Galactic Museum mysteriously appears to the player after collecting these items. The player learns that by taking these items, he has become the next in a line of adventurers attempting to destroy the Wizard's Compendium, the leather scroll the player picked up. The museum has various display cases that require the insertion of special coins of various types to access. Some coins can be bought in random encounters with NPCs, some can be found as loot after combat and some coins can only be found at the bottom level of various dungeons meaning the player cannot proceed beyond a certain point until that dungeon is finished. Unlike many RPGs, the game does not use an experience point system. The player gains levels only through the successful completion of various quests. The game is mostly in top-down style for the world maps, towns and castles, but switches to a 3D style in the dungeons and in the museum. Several different areas of the game, like games in towns and certain museum displays, allow the character to play in special mini-games, which, if done successfully, will permanently increase attributes. Also, various casinos about the towns let players gamble to win money. It is also possible to rob banks in cities, but this attracts the attention of the town guards who will remember the robbery until the player enters another town.</desc>

		<desc>In this top-down puzzle oriented game you have to help Leonardo, a little thief, on his criminal trips. Use your joystick to lead Leonardo through 50 different levels including banks, museums, and warehouses. Pressing the fire button of your joystick you can push everything in your way, except walls. Pushed objects won't stop until colliding with other objects or the police officer and his ghost deputy whom are trying to stop your robberies. Every level has a time limit in which you must bring three equal items into one line to complete the level. Each level is larger than the screen, in the lower half of the screen you have a helpful radar for orientation. Running out of time or being caught by the police-men will cost you one of your five lives. If you are able to master the first ten levels you will receive a password, which you can use to start your next game directly on this level.</desc>

		<desc>In a distant part of the universe, an alien creature called Zelos was born. As he grew so did his appetite, and soon he began devouring galaxies, planets, and stars by the hundreds. Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action-packed shooter where there are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields. Gameplay is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

When you load the game for the first time and personalise it with your name you'll see a house with several rooms like a kitchen, living room, bed room, etc. After some time of waiting a little person will appear and check out the house with all its rooms to see if he likes it. If he likes it, he will move in shortly and bring his dog along with him. That's where the real "game" starts and thats what it will be like every time you'll load the game from then. You see the house and the little person living in it, doing all kinds of stuff people do in their daily routine. He'll cook, eat, feed his dog, read newspapers, watch TV and from time to time he will write you a letter to let you know what he feels or what things he misses. To keep it more gamelike, you can "talk" to him in form of typing commands like "feed dog". You can also play cards with him and send him food or a present.
There is no aim in this game other than to interact with your LCP.</desc>

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely.

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Lords of Conquest (Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Lords of Conquest</name>
		<desc>Lords of Conquest is a strategy game by Electronic Arts from 1986, which was first written for the Apple II and then ported to the C64. It is based on the board game "Borderlands" by the English game manufacturer Eon and is designed for either up to four players or a single player against a computer opponent. The one who makes it to build or conquer three towns and keep them at least for one game round is the winner. If several players start to gain control over their third town in the same round, the game will continue until one of them loses a town or builds a fourth town. There is the alternative that you completely eliminate your competitors, but from experience both human players and computer opponent (!) throw in the sponge before it comes to that. To be able to build and defend the required three towns or, if necessary, to capture the hostile towns, the players need resources (iron, coal, wood, gold and horses), which they can gain from the correspondingly marked provinces of the map and which need to be protected from the graps of the other players. While the game against a single opponent is limited to pure tactics with military units, a game with three or four players has an additional trading phase, in which resources can be swapped / begged / blackmailed. Additionally, the players can side with the attacker or the defender during an attack. With this Lords of Conquest also allows many diplomatic interaction by founding and breaking (short-lived) allies and at the end everyone screams in confusion and goes for each other's throats... the way it should be! The game comprises twenty ready-made maps (Northamerica, China, Mediterranean area, world etc.) as well as the possibility to get new maps generated or create own maps in the editor.</desc>

		<name>Lords of Conquest</name>
		<desc>Lords of Conquest is a strategy game by Electronic Arts from 1986, which was first written for the Apple II and then ported to the C64. It is based on the board game "Borderlands" by the English game manufacturer Eon and is designed for either up to four players or a single player against a computer opponent. The one who makes it to build or conquer three towns and keep them at least for one game round is the winner. If several players start to gain control over their third town in the same round, the game will continue until one of them loses a town or builds a fourth town. There is the alternative that you completely eliminate your competitors, but from experience both human players and computer opponent (!) throw in the sponge before it comes to that. To be able to build and defend the required three towns or, if necessary, to capture the hostile towns, the players need resources (iron, coal, wood, gold and horses), which they can gain from the correspondingly marked provinces of the map and which need to be protected from the graps of the other players. While the game against a single opponent is limited to pure tactics with military units, a game with three or four players has an additional trading phase, in which resources can be swapped / begged / blackmailed. Additionally, the players can side with the attacker or the defender during an attack. With this Lords of Conquest also allows many diplomatic interaction by founding and breaking (short-lived) allies and at the end everyone screams in confusion and goes for each other's throats... the way it should be! The game comprises twenty ready-made maps (Northamerica, China, Mediterranean area, world etc.) as well as the possibility to get new maps generated or create own maps in the editor.</desc>

		<name>Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge</name>
		<desc>The first in a series of 3 racing games endorsed by the legendary car company, which is now a part of Proton.

The game features a total of 32 fictitious racetracks from around the world, split into 3 difficulty levels. There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. The higher you finish in one race, the lower down the grid you start for the next race. The opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 drivers of the day - examples include Ricardo Pastry and Crashhard Banger.

You can choose between sound effects or one of a variety of music pieces. The game features a simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode only uses half the screen, a simple animation filling the other half. In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.</desc>

The game represents the board game for 2-6 players to acquire wealth through different activities specific for the Western movies. Such activities involve the taking or giving the play money based on the luck or correct answers, as players take turns moving around the board according to the roll of the dice. A typical turn begins with the rolling of the dice and advancing clockwise around the board the corresponding number of squares. When player lands on certain square, he may be teleported to another square, or win/lose the money, or be proposed to answer a question for a defined period of time. The winner is the first player who collects the sum of money defined before the start of the game.</desc>

		<name>M.U.L.E.</name>
		<desc>Set on the fictional planet Irata (Atari backwards), the game is an exercise in supply and demand economics involving competition among four players, with computer opponents automatically filling in for any missing players. Players choose the race of their colonist, which has advantages and disadvantages that can be paired to their respective strategies. To win, players not only compete against each other to amass the largest amount of wealth, but must also cooperate for the survival of the colony.

Central to the game is the acquisition and use of Multiple Use Labor Elements, or M.U.L.E.s, to develop and harvest resources from the player's real estate. Depending on how it is outfitted, a M.U.L.E. can be configured to harvest Energy, Food, Smithore (from which M.U.L.E.s are constructed), and Crystite (a valuable mineral available only at the "Tournament" level). Players must balance supply and demand of these elements, buying what they need and selling what they don't. Players may exploit or create shortages by refusing to sell to other players or to the "store," which raises the price of the resource on the following turns. Scheming between players is encouraged by allowing collusion, which initiates a mode allowing a private transaction.</desc>

		<desc>A single classical-style pinball table is provided in this simulation. A table editor is also provided - this allows you to choose a shape for the table and arrange the component parts as you wish. Up to four players can take it in turns, each with five balls in turn. 

Unusually, the default table has multiple flippers at the bottom of the table, as well as some located higher up. Use them to return a ball higher on table and to prevent it being lost at the bottom of the table. Hitting some valuable areas of table gives you a bonus.

The catch is, that the exit needs to be activated by lighting all torches that are spread throughout a level. Naturally, there are lots of different obstacles and enemies trying to stop the player. Most enemies follow a set path, however some may chase the player's sprite through the entire stage. As the levels become more complex, it is necessary to work out routes that don't end in a dead end and allow the player to reach the exit in time while still avoiding enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Magic Serpent is a Snake variant. The player controls a snake called Lenni who has to eat all fruits which are divided over the scrolling level. Said levels are constructed like mazes, i.e. many small gangways. Every time a fruit is eaten, the length of Lenni grows. The player needs to control Lenni (he moves and turns automatically when meeting a wall; the player only needs to intervene when another turn is in order) in a way so he does get in his own way. Each level has to be completed within 60 seconds, but collecting clocks extends this limit. Other power-ups are rabbits (make Lenni faster) , snails (make Lenni slower, but no slower than the default speed), axes (the length of Lenni gets cut back to the starting value) and teleports to the starting point of the level. Each power-up also effects the points.</desc>

The player or players create a variety of monsters, bestow them with different traits and equip them with modern and/or futuristic weapons to do battle. Monsters can be further customised through buying special abilities, such as adding tentacles to use advanced weaponry.

Two players can fight against each other, play capture the flag, or compete for a high score against a computer-controlled horde. In single-player mode, the computer controls an opponent to fight.

Battles take place on various different maps that can have tactically significant effects, such as mountains for agile monsters to hide behind during combat. Monsters can be stored on diskette and can be upgraded by victories against other monsters or computer opponents.</desc>

You must fly and pass as many other competitors as you can as you try to get from the start-line to a finish-line a long distance away. To fly your helicopter you keep pressing the fire button to stay airborne and press left to move along the screen. If you stop pressing the fire button then you fall downwards towards the water, if you stop pressing left then your momentum keeps you going until you slowly come to a halt. The race is timed and you start with seventy seconds and this decreases as you race but passing buoys gives you forty extra seconds.</desc>

Before that can be done the group must explore nine chateaux each of which contains a problem and clues that are useful later in the game, battle assorted and unusual monsters, enter villages to trade, and develop your characters skills.</desc>

		<name>Mandroid</name>
		<desc>Chris Auker has stolen the Mandroid files and fled to Cove 4 in an effort to contact criminal mastermind, Max. A Mandroid agent is sent down on the planet to gather information concerning Auker's whereabouts and find the files. The agent can navigate the planet on foot, but to help him accomplish his task faster, he can use a remote vehicle. It can withstand most enemy fire, but it gets destroyed if it makes contact with any of the industrial waste rivers bordering the landscape. Energy is also used up, so the agent needs to stock up using depots scattered around the landscape. While navigating the landscape, the agent encounters many types of cyborgs along the way, both on the streets and inside buildings. The agent may decide whether to communicate with most of these cyborgs, or eliminate them with his weapons. Some of the cyborgs drop weapons when shot, and the agent may swap his default weapon for their better weapons. Most of them contain map information essential in accomplishing the mission, and the only way to get this is by threatening them. Money is necessary for success, and can be obtained by gambling or accessing credit dispensers found in the city.</desc>

Alternating with this, you are in front of a row of pipes. Hit a gong 3 times to summon a genie, who will play a sequence of notes. Once the last one has been played, they fly towards you in order, and their colour equivalent on the row must be hit (the number of times they are played), before the flying note can hurt you.

		<name>Match of the Day</name>
		<desc>There was a massive wave of football management games in 1992, and this was Zeppelin's contender. It was licensed around the BBC's football highlights programme famed for its classic theme music. The standard options exist (such as training, transfers and tactics) but the control system is unique. A diary is presented on the table, and you have to drag the icons for the activities you want to focus that amount of time on. This not only makes the presentation and style unusual, but also accurately represents the limited amount of time a real manager has.</desc>

		<name>Matchboxes</name>
		<desc>Matchboxes is a combination of a memory/concentration game and a word guessing game. The game is played by two players (the second can be AI or another human) on a grid containing 36 boxes. Upon flipping a box an animated figure is revealed and the aim is to get pairs of the same kind and colour. The player will then get to keep uncovering boxes until a match isn't made. Beneath the grid is a word which is partially revealed as boxes are opened and after every match the player gets a chance to enter the word. The player that first enters the right word wins the game. There are some different variations of the game: one that lacks the word guessing part, one with reversed words and one where the word is scrambled.</desc>

		<desc>In this action game with top-down and side-view sections, you play Professor Arabesque who has been sent by the Psychical society to rid the controlling influence of the Skull of Doom. Arabesque must jump and shoot through the Manor, to collect the treasures and use them to solve the mystery. When you die you enter a limbo room, in which one exit (randomly-selected by the game) restores Arabesque; the others result in death.

Every time you play, the bonus items are randomly placed, and the exact map layout is adjusted. There are over 1000 variations and ten skill levels. Much like today's FPS' there are vases to reload the gun and grant lives. They are reset at the beginning of each game hour.</desc>

Mayhem decides to change it back, with the help of Theo Saurus, the apprentice responsible for Monsterland being the gloomy place it is now. The game is a side-scrolling platform game, where you play the part of Mayhem. You can kill enemies by jumping on them. There are five levels in the game. Each one starts in unhappy mode, where Mayhem must collect enough bags of magic dust, from the enemies you face, then find your way to Theo's hidden cave. Theo then uses the dust to make the level happy again. This change is reflected in the more jazzy music, colourful landscape and even the monsters who look more friendly and cheerful.</desc>

		<desc>In the future, most people travel using Matter Transporters, but to Rebels this is dull. They have taken the abandoned orbital road and turned it into the Battletrack. You take your Mean Streak motorcycle and set out to dart through this dangerous Mad Max style world, with the aim of getting though these tough isometrically-viewed roads. You are armed, but so are the Outcasts you must face.

Hazards include walls, gaps in the road and oil slicks. A scanner at the bottom of the screen gives some advanced warning. You can pick up improved weaponry, extra fuel, and boxes of oil, which you can drop into the paths of onrushing bikes. As well as shooting other bikes, you can ram them into walls at the side of the road, or into the aforementioned hazards.</desc>

		<name>Mean Streets</name>
		<desc>Private investigator Tex Murphy is hired to investigate the murder of a university professor. It turns out that he was one of eight scientists involved in Project Overlord, a mission to remotely control people. You soon learn of the deaths of other related figures. Suspects may include the British intelligence head, a surveillance company owner, and the professor's daughter.

Tex's first adventure (and the only one released for systems other than DOS or Windows PCs) takes you through the seedy West Coast world of 2033. The game is icon-driven, with object puzzles less significant than detective deduction and character interaction. 

Mean Streets features dozens of characters to interact with by asking questions or offering bribes. Fights often arise, but a diplomatic approach is more successful with characters whose guilt is unproven. Although it is largely an adventure game, travel between cities involves piloting your Lotus Speeder in a flight simulation section.</desc>

		<name>Mediator</name>
		<desc>Find the time crystal... Neutralize the Doomsday Machine.
 8 Challenging, exciting scenarios. 

Eight separate scenarios with smooth scrolling screens, fast action and plenty of excitement. 

Long ago, eons past, a doomsday machine was placed in high orbit above the satellites Xylos and Pholos. It's role: to deter further acts of nuclear war between empires of the galaxy. Should critical levels of nuclear activity be detected emanating from the surface of the satellites, the machine will activate and destroy both civilizations. 

Marauding invaders, from the Zagos Galaxy, unaware of the danger from the doomsday machine, launch a nuclear attack against Pholos. Xylos then launches a counter-offensive with hypnobeams against the Zags, slowing down the critical build-up of nuclear radiation. 

Your mission: As the saviour of the galaxy, you must locate the legendary Good Mediator to acquire the mythical Time Crystal, which endows the possessor with the power to psychokinetically dispatch any destructive elements to another time zone. Leave Xylos, and seek out the planet far, far below... but, be prepared at any time to be recalled to Xylos and Pholos to combat the Zags using your joystick controlled missiles.</desc>

		<name>Mercenary</name>
		<desc>Having crash-landed on the planet Targ (en route to the Gamma System of Damocles), the player's main objective is to find a means of escape. In a trademark element of the Mercenary series, there are several ways to achieve this end. A civil war between two factions, the Palyars (indigenous "good guys") and the Mechanoids (invading "bad guys"), affords the player an opportunity to earn money to buy their escape from Targ. For instance, each faction seeks the destruction of installations belonging to its rival, and the capture of material or other resources to support their cause. There are other routes to escape, and it is possible to combine strategies to both leave Targ and keep the wealth accrued there.</desc>

		<desc>In Mermaid Madness the player takes the role of the weighty mermaid Myrtle who finally, after 112 years, found the man of her dreams: the diver Gordon. Unfortunately he is not very enthusiastic, flees into the water and jams himself under a ship. Myrtle's first priority is to save Gordon.

The player navigates Myrtle through an underwater labyrinth (although there a few screens above ground) and collects items. Those items have to be used in another location to proceed. It is also important to avoid enemies because touching them reduces her life energy, which can be refilled by finding beer bottles. There is no scrolling and Gordon's air supply acts as time limit.</desc>

		<name>Metaplex</name>
		<desc>There is a huge metal complex inside an asteroid that houses and guards a two-headed alien called Garth. Garth just wants to destroy Earth. Earth isn't going to put up with this so the player character is sent to destroy four power units that give Garth his energy. To do this he has to collect flasks, fill them up with acid, locate a power unit and blow it up. Trying to stop the protagonist are Garth's minions. The hero has a limited shield and limited lasers, which can be topped up.

Metaplex is viewed from the side. It is a maze game where one room is shown at a time. The player character rides in a space-type buggy. The screen shows the player a lot of information including lives, flasks, how much shields and lasers the hero has, score, and of course the main playing area.</desc>

		<desc>Two of the greatest icons of the Golden Age of the NBA match up in this game. On one side, the spectacular dunks of Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls; on the other, Larry Bird's incredible accuracy from the outside. 

While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal, each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts from the judges, and win the competition.

While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird's stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan's speed and jumping abilities?</desc>

		<desc>Microleague eschew action in favor of strategy for this licensed baseball game. The real-life teams and players are included, as well as classic teams from the past - lots of data disks were released featuring additional lineups. Each play is graphically shown, with a running commentary detailing how it unfolds.

A wide range of strategies are available. You can bring the stand-in players in, and instruct players as to how aggressively to play when opportunities arise, with 7 distinct batting strategies. When fielding you have options on field placement and bowling style - use the fastball and curveball wisely. Players will sometimes pick up injuries (the correct level of warming up can reduce this risk), or argue with the umpire over controversial decisions.</desc>

		<desc>The Midnight Resistance fighters are up against the awesome powers of mad scientist King Crimson and his Crimson Corps. Crimson has kidnapped your scientist grandfather and five more of your relatives, and aims to put his advanced plans to evil use.

Take control of a Resistance fighter in this scrolling shoot 'em up consisting of nine platform-based levels, each ending with a Boss to defeat. Your enemies appear on foot and in vehicles, and Crimson has also planted machine gun bays en route. 

Dead enemies release keys, which can be traded in at shop points for weapons. These weapons include machine guns and flamethrowers, for which ammunition must be bought - weapons are discarded when you have no suitable ammo. The control system is unusual - you can shoot in different directions and crawl along low ledges.</desc>

		<desc>The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party of local adventurers helping him. The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun.

Gates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.</desc>

		<name>Might and Magic II : Gates to Another World</name>
		<desc>The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party of local adventurers helping him. The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun.

Gates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Mind Control (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Mind Control</name>
		<desc>Mind Control is a single screen game split into two parts where your mission is to destroy Zyco, an indestructible alien who is ruling Earth and enslaving all humans. Scientists realising that Zyco can't be destroyed, have worked out that his only weak spot would be the massive sensory neurone in his brain and so have selected you to be shrunk to enter his bloodstream to move around his brain before destroying the neurone with a laser. The first part of the game is a platformer where you must get from the bottom right of the screen and climb stairs at each end of the three levels that make up the screen to get to Zyco's brain. Trying to stop you are people and these have to be jumped or if you touch them, then you lose one of three lives. At the top of the screen is a Miniaturising Room where you are shrunk before you enter the brain.

The second part of the game has you viewing the brain from the side and you have to make your way from the bottom of the screen to the centre of the brain following a path. As you move around the brain there are white blood corpuscles and anti-bodies following a set path and these must be avoided or you increase in size and a life is lost. The walls that make up the path also make you grow if touched so these have to be avoided as well. Once you reach the center and destroy the neurone you then keep attempting to move around the brain over various levels where the enemies get faster.

The ACE release doesn't have the first platform part of the game, just the moving around the brain part.</desc>

		<name>Mission Elevator</name>
		<desc>A bomb has been set by terrorists to blow up a sky-scraping hotel in which the FBI’s Central Intelligence Unit is located, and you must diffuse it. 
Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you can’t move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of – he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In some cases furniture can be used to your advantage. 
The whole game is similar to Impossible Mission, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and structured thought.</desc>

		<desc>A bomb has been set by terrorists to blow up a sky-scraping hotel in which the FBI’s Central Intelligence Unit is located, and you must diffuse it. 
Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you can’t move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of – he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In some cases furniture can be used to your advantage.

The game faithfully recreates the rules of the board game and allows six players (human or computer) to compete against each other to make as much money as possible dealing with houses and hotels on famous streets of London. The winner emerges when all their competitors lose all their money and become bankrupt.

The whole board is shown at the top of the screen at an elevated angle with a close up of the squares the current player is on below. The options to allow you to play the game sit above the board and can be selected with the joystick or keyboard.</desc>

		<desc>Monster Smash is a side view single screen platformer where your task is to capture all the monsters that are partying around the local graveyard. The screen has four rows of platforms containing four gravestones on three of the levels and part of the platforms can be turned 90°. The partying monsters appear from the top and left of the screen and move to the right of the screen along the platforms. Turning the platforms makes the monsters move downwards when they hit the turned parts and head to the bottom of the screen. Pressing the fire button makes the gravestones move up and down and when a monster hits a gravestone then they are captured. If the monster hits the other side of the screen then they have escaped and let too many escape, shown by a gauge, then it is game over. Once a certain amount of monsters have been captured then you move to the next level. Before you start the game you can select the level number from one to nine.</desc>

You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat. That's why the monsters in the game should be avoided: a collision with an enemy leads to a premature death.</desc>

		<desc>(From the instruction manual)

In Moonmist, you are a famous young American detective. An old friend, Tamara Lynd, has written you a letter (included in the package), asking for your help. And so you have travelled to England to test your detective skills.

As the story begins, you are outside Tresyllian Castle - the old, dark, hauntingly beautiful castle where Tamara now lives. Tamara greets you, and you meet some interesting guests. But your visit soon turns to mystery, as a trail of riddles and clues leads you to a hidden valuable treasure.

But Tamara is worried about a ghost that is tormenting her. What does the ghost want? Is it jealous of her? Does the ghost want the hidden treasure for itself? Or is the ghost a fake - just someone dressing up to frighten Tamara? If so, why?

Some of the characters in the game will treat you differently whether you play as a male or female character, and the game comes with four different variations (choosen at the start by picking a color).

		<desc>In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

The object of the game is to enter the Aither with your ship and destroy enough Orbitals to shut down the Nucleus. Before the Nucleus dies it spits out a Morphi which when destroyed gives you bonus points and money. Before you deploy your ship from your base you can purchase hulls and weapons. Even sell or scrap the ones that you don't need.
The game is viewed from above your large ship. After deploying from your base you can move about freely in any direction. On the screen you can see your score and a small radar which shows the position of the Orbitals and Nucleus. The further into the game you go and buy more hulls and weapons you will end up with a ship that nearly fills the screen.</desc>

		<desc>You control Mr. Do as he tries to harvest all of the cherries on the screen. However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Mr. Do can defend himself from the bad guys in two ways: firstly, he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Do's Castle</name>
		<desc>Mr. Do!'s Castle is an action platform game which has you in a castle consisting of several floors, each of which contain a variety of blocks. You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles. 

There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. 

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Ms. Pac-Man (USA) (Budget).nib</path>
		<name>Ms. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

		<name>The Muncher</name>
		<desc>The Mucher is a game of destruction and devastation. The
Player controls a large and angry pre-historic monster who
is out to destroy Japan. Why should a normally peace-loving
creature wish to inflict such havoc? Well, it seems that some
Japanese explorers have unearthed and stolen some eggs and have
brought them back to Japan. For centuries they, like everyone else,
have thought your species to be long extinct - they are WRONG!

As the game begins you arrive at the coast of Japan in search of the
lost eggs which have been scattered around the cities of this island
country. Naturally, the armed forces are out in force and your must
battle your way through the cities and army bases carrying out your
plan of "Urban re-development".

In the course of your Journey, you will come across your lost eggs.
Once they have found, you should search for a nuclear waste dump.
Not only are these nuclear waste sites very tasty and invigorating
but they are also very good sites for hatching monster eggs. Using
these sites you are able to create more monsters to carry on should
you fail.

As Japan is such a small place, and with all this monster activity
in the surrounding sea, it is not surprising that you will occasionally
encounter other monsters during your exploits. Like your monster, they
tend to have a rather intense need to express their deeper emotions by
means of violence and destruction! If you must defeat all three enemy
monsters.

Finally, you (or one of your descendants) will reach the harbour and
will sail off into the sunset (well, almost) and, like the endless
cycles of life, it will all begin anew.</desc>

		<name>Murder on the Mississippi</name>
		<desc>The famous detective Sir Charles Foxworth is taking a holiday on the Mississippi with his servant Regis on the Delta Princess. He's just taking a stroll around the upper deck of the ship when he discovers an open cabin door. Behind it: a dead man. As it turns out, the body of Raleigh Cartwright III. Sir Charles has three days to find the murderer, because then, the ship will reach New Orleans, giving the culprit a safe chance to escape. The joystick controls the player's sprite to move into the respective direction, and pressing the button opens a menu with appropriate commands for the current situation. Walk around, Inspect an item, or examine evidence. You will meet some characters who also happen to be suspects. Use these encounters as a fact-finding session. Take notes on what he or she has said. Share these notes with other passengers and crew members. But your first job is to find the body. Until you do, any information you gather will be of little value. Once you find the body, the other passengers will prove to be much more talkative. Collect as many notes and evidence as you can to solve the mystery. Once you think that you have it solved, make an accusation by going to the character that you want to accuse and by using the joystick, point to Talk to [character's name], and press the joystick button. Then point to Accuse [character's name] and press the joystick button. Depending on the amount of evidence collected, you will know if your hunch was right or wrong. Murder on the Mississippi has four possible endings with many variations on each one. Don't let the Delta Princess arrive to New Orleans before you solve the mystery, or the murderer will get away.</desc>

		<name>Mystery Master - Murder by the Dozen</name>
		<desc>Become a police detective and solve 12 murders in Micropolis. Players interview witnesses, gather evidence, and sift through lab reports to get the clues they need to solve each case. Each action, particularly traveling between locations, adds time to the game clock.

One to four people can play, competing to see who solves the mystery first and in the optimum amount of time. After the case is presented, players take turns choosing an option, getting a clue number, and then looking it up in the manual. Once a player thinks they have it solved, they present their solution to the others. Then he looks up the complete solution. If it's 100% right, he wins and the players start on a new case. If any detail is wrong, he's out of the game and the others continue toward a solution.</desc>

		<name>Neutral Zone</name>
		<desc>The player is taken to the outer edges of the galaxy, and their mission is to protect Alpha IV from alien ships who are attacking it. The game can be played up to five levels; and the higher the level, the more ships players have to destroy. The ships vary in their size, speed, and destructive capability. Not only do they attack Alpha IV, but they also attack your weapons pod, so the point is to wipe them out before they have a chance to attack.

Missiles are fired at the ships from the weapons pod which rotate through 360 degrees. The control panel shows where the attacking ship is, leaving the player to find it and destroy it. Only one ship attacks at any time and it continues to attack until the ship is either destroyed or the time limit expires. If the 'Turrent Damaged' message appears, traversing will be slow until the self repair systems fixes the damage, giving the ships more chance to continue their attack on Alpha IV.

If all the ships have been wiped out, the player is returned to the title screen to select a new game. On harder levels, missiles that come from alien ships have a disturbing frequency and precision.</desc>

The game itself is indeed a platformer where you have to outrun giants (as in the movie) or push them over ledges. With every level you will be awarded with another advancement in the plot, usually a few pages written on a "book".</desc>

		<name>The Newzealand Story</name>
		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

		<name>A Nightmare on Elm Street</name>
		<desc>Based on the famous movie, A Nightmare of Elm Street is an action game, where you choose one of the five characters and try to free your friends from the grasp of the evil Freddy Krueger. 

You start on the city streets, where you have to find Freddy's house while avoiding Freddy himself. Once you're inside, you're free to explore the many floors of the house. You have to find your friends before Freddy kills them; the game shows you on which level each of your friends is and how much health he has left. 

Your character has two meters: a "soul" meter and a "power" meter. The "soul" is your health, and if it runs out, you die. The "power" allows you to use your special attack, different for every character. On your way, you'll meet a lot of monsters, which you can try to defeat with weapons or with your special attack. 

While walking around the house, you'll find many items you can pick up and use (but note that you have limited space in your inventory). Some items heal you, some are weapons and some have other uses. You'll also find batteries, bullets and coins - coins will allow you to buy various useful things, and batteries and bullets are necessary for some items to work.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Nine Princes in Amber (USA, Europe) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>Nine Princes in Amber</name>
		<desc>This interactive fiction game is based on Roger Zelazny's fantasy novels Nine Princes In Amber (1970) and The Guns of Avalon (1972).

The game begins with you as Prince Corwin forced to compete against your eight scheming noble brothers and sisters for the throne of Amber at the center of the one true world. Corwin must travel across the dimensions to this fascinating realm and from there rally forces against those who would oppose him. Unfortunately, things do not always proceed as planned.

When you wake up, you know little of this, as you have been knocked unconscious and pummeled with drugs. All you have is the address of your scheming sister.

The game is largely based around interaction with other characters, and can end in 40 different ways depending on how these work.</desc>

		<desc>This game from "Tuniques bleues" is based on the American Civil War. You choose your side and move your army on the map. When you attack your enemy you switch to battle mode. Cannon, cavalry and infantry take turns fighting each other. The main map allows you to view both your troops and your resources. You can also take possession of the railway lines to enrich yourself. When your chest is full, a new unit is ready for battle and reinforcements can be brought in from the coast. Note that the capture of trains and enemy forts are action phases seen from the side.
The Indians can play the spoilers randomly and make you lose units.</desc>

		<name>Nova Blast</name>
		<desc>Nova Blast is a side-scrolling sci-fi shooter in which you must defend four shielded cities from invaders that attack from both in the air and on the ground. Each city has a bubble shield that can sustain one hit; another hit to an unshielded city will destroy it.

Players control a ship that can fire lasers horizontally and drop bomb vertically. The ship is also equipped with an energy beam that can absorb energy from energy tanks, and can also use that energy to create temporary shields around unprotected cities. The ship can also sustain up to ten blows in each round. If all four cities are destroyed or the ship takes ten hits in a round, the game ends.

Nova Blast is a single player game with three difficulty levels.</desc>

		<desc>As an Irish prospector named Timothy O'Riley, dig an unending series of mines searching for coal, gold, diamonds, rubies, and oil. But watch out for the evil creatures you've disturbed and the rising underground river - don't let either one touch you or you will die! And beware - the creatures move much faster while the moon is up. The river is unstoppable, but you can kill or block the creatures with a limited supply of dynamite.

O'Riley's Mine is essentially a high-speed variant of Mr. Do! and Boulder Dash - you must race around collecting everything before returning to the top of the mine shaft while the creatures chase you and the water rises relentlessly.</desc>

		<desc>As a fish, the player could "go exploring" or "play for points". The object was to decide which fish to eat, while trying to survive and avoid other enemies; such as otters, ospreys, and bait from fishermen. When simply exploring, the player could select from six different species of fish, such as Mackinaw Trout, Whitefish, or Rainbow Trout; however, when playing for points, the computer randomly assigned the type of fish that the player will play as. In addition, the titles for each of the types of fish and other creatures are removed when playing for points, forcing the player to rely on memory; also the game was timed. After every five moves, the player played as a different type of fish.</desc>

		<desc>Oil's Well is a computer game distributed by Sierra On-Line in 1983, and again in 1990. The game was programmed by Thomas J. Mitchell and Bill Sargent. Bill Sargent went on to work on The Sims and SimCity 2000. Oil's Well is similar to the 1982 arcade game Anteater. Extend your oil-mining robotic arm deep below the earth's crust to mine oil and line your pockets. But watch out for the monstrous bugs that lie in wait for you -- one touch of them to the robotic arm and you lose a life!</desc>

		<desc>Omega casts the player into the role of a cyber-tank designer and programmer. The goal is to design a powerful tank capable of defeating opponents within the frames of a limited budget. A successful completion of this task grants the player character a higher security clearance and a large budget. Combat plays little to no role in the game; the gameplay is dedicated to designing the tanks themselves. The player programs tanks by using a built-in text editor. It is possible to assign different artificial intelligence script commands that control various aspects of the tank, as well as enable communication between several tanks in a group. The player must take into account the equipment of a tank and its attributes in order to design a vehicle that would prove successful in combat.</desc>

		<name>On Field Football</name>
		<desc>On-Field Football is a game based on the sport of American Football where you can play the computer or another player following the rules closely. Before you play a game you can select how many players or a demo game, how long for a game (5 or 15 mins), and how the players will play a game. The view of the pitch is a 3rd person perspective at a elevated angle with the action behind the offensive team. 

The game kicks off and once the player catching the ball is tackled then decisions need to be made. Using the joystick, you push it up, down, left or right to select a play and this needs to be selected within 30 seconds. Once both teams have selected then you can control either the quarter back if offensive or a defender if defensive. Once the quarterback has passed it the player with the ball is under your control. You are also able to punt the ball or kick the ball for the extra point or a field goal.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Frog is an educational title where players explore the inner body of a frog. You can choose between a male and female frog in the References section. There are two game modes: Dissect and Reconstruct. In Dissect mode, players have to cut open the frog's body and remove its organs; and in Reconstruct mode, players have to put the already removed organs back to the frog's body in the correct order. This game offers you scissors, a probe, a magnifying glass and tweezers - the necessary tools for your work. The scissors (not available in Reconstruct section) help you cut the frog's body and remove organs, the probe gives you hints of where to cut (in Dissect section) or which part to place first (in Reconstruct section), the magnifying glass gives you information about each organ, and the tweezers help you move the organs. You don't have to remove all the organs to see their information as you can look them up anytime at the Frog File Index section. You can also see the arrangement of the organs at the OptiFrog section. The game offers players a saving function.</desc>

Operation Hanoi is a one player game where the action is viewed as a 1st person perspective as the game scrolls to the right. Enemy soldiers and vehicles appear from the sides and top of the screen. You control crosshairs on the screen to aim and fire; grenades can also be thrown.

You only have so much ammo so shoot parachutes falling from the sky which carry extra ammo as well as 1st aid boxes to keep you alive. As well as your main playing area you can also see your score, ammo, lives, amount of enemy and a hits bar.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Operation Thunderbolt (Europe) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>Operation Thunderbolt</name>
		<desc>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.

You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.

There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Operation Whirlwind (USA, Europe) (b-savegame).nib</path>
		<name>Operation Whirlwind</name>
		<desc>Operation Whirlwind is a tactical scale wargame set during the World War 2. As a battalion commander of an armored task force the player is ordered to capture (within 35 game turns, divided into phases) a city 15 kilometers away, defended by opposing forces. At your disposal are infantry, engineer, recon, tank and artillery units. Dig in your troops, deploy bridges, watch for enemy mines and barrage fire.

The player's task is to maneuver over open ground on a battle grid three screens five separate parts: 1.Unit placement and disposition phase: Dug in and defending, or In motion on recon.
2.Forces Movement phase: vertically or horizontally on the grid map, using the joystick. When in motion, firing is not possible. Enemy units are invisible until they fire on you, and mine fields are not visible until you hit them.
3.Combat phase: Here you are engaged by artillery and small arms fire.
4.Assault Order phase: . In this phase you are able to advance and maneuver your units that have not exhausted their ammunition in the prior operations against enemy formations, utilizing head on assaults, or fast flanking armored attacks. Enemy units will be dislodged and will move, using their own firepower to attempt to break up your attacks. The player will need to engage his engineer units to bridge river crossings while in action.
5.Final assault phase: The orders given in the prior phase become a mixed bag in the fog of war, and the gamer must react to circumstances that naturally occur as previously undetected enemy units deploy against the assaults as they unfold.
With the conclusion of each turn of five phases, the player will be assessed of his success or failure, and will be offered the opportunity to save or delete the prior game action before continuing to the next turn. There are four increasingly difficult levels of engagement, each of which will result in five levels of outcome, from total victory, through stalemate, to abject defeat.</desc>

It is a "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades.  Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds.
You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, ... Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough.
Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

		<desc>Race across varied terrain in this conversion of one of the most famous arcade racing games. Your Ferrari is at the ready, complete with female passenger, over a series of short tracks.

Gameplay is viewed form just above and behind the car, so you can see it. The roads are full of sharp bends and hazards, contact with which can cause the car to roll and lose you time. On each section of track there is a fork in the road, allowing you to choose which direction you go in. You have to complete 5 track sections in total, out of the 15 in the game.</desc>

		<desc>The third game in the OutRun series, which revolutionised the third-person perspective style of racing games. The levels are set across Europe, as you bid to escape from the police. Unlike in the predecessors, you use a different vehicle on each level, with motorbikes and jet-skis adding variety and taking different skill to use. You must complete each level within the strict time limits, and the roads are dogged with other cars to avoid and overtake. You can choose between sound effects or music.</desc>

		<name>Overrun - Mideast</name>
		<desc>Overrun! offers meticulous simulation of late twentieth-century squad-level action in European and Middle Eastern terrain. Players command a battalion of infantry, armor, artillery, and helicopters on behalf of Arab states, Iran, Israel, NATO, and the Warsaw Pact. The bulk of scenarios are speculative and near-future (including an Iranian invasion of Kuwait), but one historic war is presented, the 1973 Arab-Israeli "October War." A single-player campaign of randomly generated maps starts you with a core force which you will hopefully retain and expand with each victory.

SSI builds on its Panzer Strike engine with this release. Each unit has several static attributes, from size to morale, and a changing state based on orders and circumstance which determine its combat effectiveness from moment to moment. Weapons -- and there are dozens -- are carefully detailed with six characteristics of their own. Vehicle armor is distinguished by location, so facing plays an important role, too. The manual gives a thorough explanation of the mechanics, including formulas, plus a nineteen-page supplement of tables.

The currency of each turn is orders, gained and spent by each command unit. Without orders, your squads will only continue what they're doing or react to what is being done to them. If they lose their commanding superior, control goes to the computer. Orders are issued almost in real-time, because movement and actions occur in twenty-second (game-time) pulses and run continuously until a player interrupts the action to issue commands. This combination of a fragile chain of command and continuous play means that letting your eyes glaze over can turn the unexpected into total defeat.

The play screen is devoted to a small-scale map, fifty yards per square, with one level of outward zoom. A lot of scrolling is a necessity to judge the terrain, but a helpful line-of-sight tool removes some of the guesswork. Below the map is a menu of abbreviated commands and submenus, with a status line for the selected unit or terrain. Terrain factors are modified in-game with smoke, whether fired by units or resulting from burning vehicles and vegetation.

The scenarios can be played solitaire, hot-seat with two players, or entirely by the computer. A scenario editor gives complete control over map creation and initial forces, plus three different types of engagements, several objectives, and five levels of difficulty.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/P.H.M. Pegasus (USA, Europe) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>P.H.M. Pegasus</name>
		<desc>PHM Pegasus is a combination simulation and action game. You control a naval hydrofoil missile boat, and need to complete a variety of different missions. Some of the missions include destroying all enemy vessels in a given area, surveillance requiring you to identify the location of enemy ships (without sinking them!), or to escort a supply ship through hostile territory. As missions are successfully completed you earn points based on how successful the mission was, and with increasing points you can advance in rank, from deck mopper up to admiral. Your performance on one mission won't have an affect on future ones, and you can choose to play missions out of order as well.  Several missions include other craft you can control to help out (both ships and helicopters). A time compression mode is included, which can be used to reduce the amount of time waiting to arrive at a destination, or even left on to make the action sequences more challenging.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

You now have to destroy all the droids on the fleet of eight ships.  You control an "Influence Device" which can temporarily control other droids and use their weapons to destroy the others. When your power is low or your damage is high, you will need to transfer to another droid or risk losing your Influence Device.

There was also an updated version called Heavy Metal Paradroid released in 1986 and Paradroid 90 (for the Amiga) released in 1990.</desc>

		<name>Parallax</name>
		<desc>The entire world is in the grip of a computer known simply as The Big One. Its code is far too complex for you to crack, so you must find scientists, drug them, and bring them to The Big One. Each will be able to unlock one letter. Simply finding these scientists is the hard part - The Big One has aliens patrolling its base, and they are more than capable of ganging up on you. In essence Parallax is a top-view multi-directional-scrolling shoot 'em up. Improved weaponry and shield recharges can be bought by the machine - can you think of a way to get money from a drugged scientist? You can duck under the layers of surface, but so can the aliens, so action can take place here. You can also get out of your ship and patrol the area on foot. The game's parallax scrolling routine inspired the title, and it also has 11-minute introductory music.</desc>

		<name>Patton vs Rommel</name>
		<desc>A turn-based war game set in World War II that simulates a what-if battle between General Patton and Field Marshal Rommel for control of Normandy, hence the name.

As the war is fought you get points, and the objective, of course is to gather as much points as possible (positive points if you're Allied, negative if you're Axis). Although it's strategical simulation is rather simplistic, taking a more entertaining approach, it has many features, available options and a lot of feedback from the computer (including tips from the computerized Patton's and Rommel's).

The game had a feature very similar to today's well-known Fog-of-War, though it's functionality was not as smooth as it is today. The warzone is divided into Zones of Control, with it's units and actions invisible to the adversary until he attempts to move through it and fight for it.</desc>

		<desc>The aim of this interactive fiction with graphics is to escape from the land of Kerovnia, where strange occurrences are routine. The Roobikyoub dwarves have been banished from the kingdom, which is not good as they produce high-quality whisky. King Erik is not popular for this decision, as some feel that ale brewers and mineral water bottlers have influenced him. Honest John the trader and Kronos the Magician play a key role in your journey, each offering sub-quests to attempt.

The package includes a novella complete with map and decipherable hints, which are accessed by typing 'hint' followed by the code into the computer. Therefore, those with only a pirated copy would struggle to complete the game.

Your score and the number of locations visited are both displayed in the title bar. The parser allows whole words to be deleted and unaccepted previous entries to be re-edited.</desc>

For three thousand years, the tomb has been a mystery and deathtrap. It is rumored that the chambers contain dark and terrible dangers for those that would make the pharaoh's treasure their own. And even more ghastly, the pharaoh and the guardian mummy are said to walk the chambers for all eternity, destroying all trespassers in the tomb. You've heard it all before and lived to tell about it and this is a chance of a lifetime. You've spent months finding these ruins and finally you're here at the fabled tomb. Still... what if the legends are true? As you descend into the first chamber, you hear footsteps...</desc>

		<name>Pick 'n' Pile</name>
		<desc>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.

In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</desc>

		<desc>From Konami's coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.</desc>

The game is a sidescrolling adventure and takes mostly place in the house of the employer. Pink Panther can himself move freely in the house, but at the same time he needs to keep his eye on the sleepwalker, so that he can prevent him from stumbling on various objects, such as rugs and tables.

Before each level you can purchase different kind of objects from a store. These items can be used to gently lure the sleeping man in the right path.</desc>

		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.</desc>

		<name>Pirates Of The Barbary Coast</name>
		<desc>Returning to his ship after doing business in the harbour, Captain Articus learns that his ship has been attacked and that his daughter Katherine has been kidnapped by Bloodthroat the pirate. He demands a ransom of 50,000 gold coins within thirty days or he will sell her.
You must free the girl from the clutches of the vile pirates of the Barbary Coast by paying the ransom. Fortunately, you have a treasure map and you are an experienced merchant.
You start the game in the port of Casablanca. You can choose a destination or visit it. In general, all ports look the same. There is a merchant, a ship repair dock and a shop. The main difference between the ports is the price of the goods. Your main goal is to buy cheap and sell expensive. You start the game with 5000 gold coins.</desc>

This game lets you choose from 6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented.

The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of "evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.</desc>

		<name>Pitfall 2 - Lost Caverns</name>
		<desc>You play Pitfall Harry searching for the Raj diamond, his niece Rhonda, her cat Quickclaw and a variety of treasures somewhere in the Andes. Poisonous frogs, eels, scorpions, bats and other hazards get in the way.

Pitfall II is the sequel to Pitfall!, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter in the form of red crosses. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint. The score is reduced based on the distance travelled to get to the cross.

As he explores Harry can collect gold bars which give him a 5000 points award. His total score acts as an energy reserve. If the score is reduced to zero then the game ends and the player must restart from the beginning.</desc>

		<desc>Pitfall! is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep in the jungle. With a little luck, you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens if you can live that long!</desc>

		<name>Pitstop</name>
		<desc>Pitstop is an action racing game featuring six different race tracks. Your goal is to earn as much money as possible by winning races in the Grand Circuit which consists of a race on each of the six tracks; each time a race is completed, you'll earn money based on how you placed and the number of laps completed before moving on. While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.</desc>

		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</desc>

		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</desc>

		<desc>Pogo Joe is a game very similar to Q*Bert, although there is enough variation to consider it more than just a clone. Similar to Q*Bert, the player changes the color of the object they land on, in Pogo Joe's case these are barrels as opposed to cubes, until the entire level is changed to the new color. Also, the levels can look like something other than a pyramid. There are enemies to avoid, and properties of the barrels also vary. Instead of discs that Q*Bert uses to escape his foes, there is the super jump ability as well as certain colored barrels a player can use to clear the enemies off the screen.</desc>

		<name>Pooyan</name>
		<desc>In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>

		<desc>Ever wanted to race dune buggies at high speed on a variety of tracks? Power Drift is an arcade racer that gives you the chance to do just that.

There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. 

Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You’ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you’re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. 

Finish all 5 stages in a level and you’ll be presented with a bonus level.</desc>

		<name>Powerboat Simulator</name>
		<desc>If this 'simulator' is to be believed, powerboat racing is a chaotic race across a number of largely one-directional tracks with fjords and inlets forcing you down one of two lanes, and sections where a bridge needs to be cleared by hitting a ramp at the right speed beforehand (as you jump over these, you can land so as to skim off other boats). Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.

As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple instantaneous action.</desc>

		<name>Power Play Hockey</name>
		<desc>Powerplay Hockey is a ice hockey game concentrating on the game between the USA and the USSR. Before starting the game you are to choose the number of players (on-on-one or five-on-five) and length of match (two, tvelwe or twenty minutes per period). When in the game try wrist shots, slap shots, faceoff, drop passing, and body checking. Roughing and crosscheking will give you a penalty.</desc>

		<desc>Predator is a side-scrolling platformer which uses the imagery and characters from the classic Arnie movie of the same name. The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times.

The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.</desc>

		<name>Protector 2</name>
		<desc>An arcade style game with a loose basis on the arcade hit Defender, Protector II is a side-scrolling shooter. Like Defender, there are lots of different aliens to contend with, and some ground based enemies as well. There are no smart bombs, however. You have to rescue humans as well (twice) from both an alien ship, and later a city that will be overrun with lava from a volcano that erupts during the game; all the while protecting them from aliens. You then have to drop them one at a time (unlike Defender, you can only carry one human at a time) into a teleporter tube to get them off the planet entirely. The game is quite difficult, with some very precise flying required at times (probably even more difficult than Defender or Stargate). It also has more of a "plot" than the arcade games it is based on, with several sub-missions of rescue depending on what stage you are at (it should be noted that there is no breaks between "stages" - the whole game play is continuous).</desc>

Psycastria is a top-down horizontal scrolling shooter. Go across each base, destroy the 10 energy pods that power the Psycastrian war machine while avoiding buildings and engaging alien spacecraft, then go to the next base. Unusually for a shooter, you can turn around at any time to go after any missed targets. Between bases, there is a bonus level that tests your timing at destroying aliens.</desc>

		<desc>Puffy and his fortuitously-named girlfriend Puffyn are trapped in an alien world full of threats, traps and surprises. Taking control of one or the other (Puffy is more powerful but Puffyn can move faster) you must find your way through.

Puffy's Saga is an overhead view maze game that represents a cutesy variant of Gauntlet. Each of the 20 levels has a quota of dots to eat before the level is completed. These levels are inhabited by foes who surround you and reduce your energy on contact. Meat restores 100 energy points each time - this total can go beyond its starting level of 500. You are armed with a gun, which not only kills foes but also turns many of them into edible energy-giving snacks.

Keys must be collected and used to open doors. Magic Goms allow you to use a map or a fire-bolt. Other available bonuses include invincibility periods and teleporting.</desc>

These levels are inhabited by foes who surround you and reduce your energy on contact. Meat restores 100 energy points each time - this total can go beyond its starting level of 500. You are armed with a gun, which not only kills foes but also turns many of them into edible energy-giving snacks.

Keys must be collected and used to open doors. Magic Goms allow you to use a map or a fire-bolt. Other available bonuses include invincibility periods and teleporting.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Puzznic (Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

		<desc>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/R-Type (Europe) (Side 1).nib</path>
		<name>R-Type</name>
		<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

		<name>R-Type</name>
		<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

		<desc>Raid on Bungeling Bay is the first game designed by Will Wright. 

The game has the player controlling a helicopter which is on a mission to destroy everything that moves. The only ally is the carrier, which is where the player begins at each level and may return to for repair and pick up bombs, as long as the player manages to protect it from being destroyed. The main goal in each level is to destroy a factory, which requires a steady increasing amount of bombs. Enemy forces include ships, planes, tanks, anti-air guns, and eventually, a large battleship.</desc>

		<name>Raid Over Moscow</name>
		<desc>The USSR has launched a huge attack on the USA, and the only hope for the free world is for you (as leader of a US Squadron of fighters) to destroy their defense bases. This is done in a multi-stage action game with some similarities to the same developer's Beach Head. All the mini-games must be completed before the time limit on the bomb is expired.

The first thing you will see is a missile being launched; the game then takes you to your hangar, from which you must quickly launch as many ships as possible, a task made difficult by the limited gravity. You must then fly it into Soviet airspace in a side-view shoot 'em up section, in which staying low keeps you safe from radars, and quick reactions see you shoot enemy fighters and avoid trees.

The next scene takes place on a single-screen view, with five windows to shoot through, and enemies aiming at you to be avoided. You then reach the base, and must shoot out approaching enemies. Finally, you must use discs onto a wall, such that they rebound to hit maintenance robots, with the ultimate goal of causing the base to overheat, the Soviet attack to be thwarted, and the US to be saved.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Rainbow Walker (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Rainbow Walker</name>
		<desc>This game is about a baby owl tasked with coloring of the rainbow high above the clouds. The rainbow is organized as stripes of colors, which initially appear as different shades of gray. The stripes themselves are split into smaller squares. The owl navigates the playfield by jumping back, forward, left or right, one square at a time, coloring them in the process. 

Some squares are in fact gaping holes and jumping on those will send the owl tumbling down to his death. Trying to stop him from accomplishing the noble task are weird looking imps, birds and other critters that seem bent on devouring the little guy as they converge on him from all directions. The only way to escape the gruesome fate is clever avoidance. 

As the game progresses, not only does the shape of the rainbow become narrower and trickier, with more dead ends and pitfalls, but also the speed and number of the enemies increases. Every few stages a bonus round is offered, during which extra lives can be gained by quickly hopping on pieces of the rainbow appearing in random directions.

The game is presented in pseudo-3D perspective and features cosmetic day and night changes.</desc>

		<name>Rally Speedway</name>
		<desc>Rally Speedway is a conversion with expansions (improved graphics and track editor) of the racing game with the same name for the Mattel Intellivision console. The physics of driving have been programmed very well for the possibilities at that time and the options for adjusting are diverse. But the special thing in this game is the two-player-mode. There is no split screen as in Pitstop II, but both racing cars are in the same screen. If a car now falls back so far - be it through a crash or slower driving - that the distance between the two racing cars is greater than the size of the screen, the race will be interrupted, the driver who had fallen back will get a penalty, both cars are set up next to each other again and the race is continued at the current points. Another interesting detail is, that you can force each other from the street. If the six tracks built into the game are not enough, one can design some more with the track editor and also save them on disk (24 tracks per disk).</desc>

		<name>Rambo III</name>
		<desc>Rambo's mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was putting this right (we won't mention who they enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.

In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect.

Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Ranarama (Europe) (Budget).nib</path>
		<name>Ranarama</name>
		<desc>The purpose of apprentice courses is for young people to learn a trade gradually, without putting yourself or your employers at risk. Unfortunately, nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, and made him attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog.

Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games.

The game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid.

This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means it’s Game Over.</desc>

The 2D galaxy map is marked only by planets and their names in few different colors. Also, there is no diplomacy and no player control over tactical combat. What remains is a hard-core game of grand strategic and economic production. The player must tweak his planets, build ships, research new tech levels, and deploy fleets.

His wardrobe has included a red T-shirt and a red and blue striped sweater (similar to the Montreal Canadiens jersey, but without the logo).

Generally, the series consists of point-and-click adventure games where the player must use their inventory and interact with characters to solve a series of puzzles. These puzzles were originally reading-based challenges but different titles focus on other subject areas. Visually, the game consists of a series of static screens which the player can navigate through by clicking on certain "travel" hot-spots. Other hot-spots can trigger an interaction with a character, item, song or mini-game.</desc>

		<name>Realm of Impossibility</name>
		<desc>The game is a dungeon crawl in which the player can traverse through 13 dungeons of various complexity in order to gather seven crowns to defeat the evil cleric "Wistrik". Each dungeon comprises up to a dozen separate rooms, with the game moving from one to another when the player moves onto a number of defined door areas. The player had to navigate through the rooms to find the treasure, either a crown or a key that provided access to a formerly locked dungeon. They then had to retrace their steps to exit the dungeon. The rooms normally contained zombies, snakes, spiders and other various beasts. The game's enemies could not be killed, but were generally stupid, simply running directly at the player. Careful timing and positioning could trap them in locations where they could no longer reach you. The player could also drop crosses by pressing the joystick fire button. These acted as obstacles to the monsters, and were dropped in opportune locations to block pursuit.

		<desc>The game is a dungeon crawl in which the player can traverse through 13 dungeons of various complexity in order to gather seven crowns to defeat the evil cleric "Wistrik". Each dungeon comprises up to a dozen separate rooms, with the game moving from one to another when the player moves onto a number of defined door areas. The player had to navigate through the rooms to find the treasure, either a crown or a key that provided access to a formerly locked dungeon. They then had to retrace their steps to exit the dungeon. The rooms normally contained zombies, snakes, spiders and other various beasts. The game's enemies could not be killed, but were generally stupid, simply running directly at the player. Careful timing and positioning could trap them in locations where they could no longer reach you. The player could also drop crosses by pressing the joystick fire button. These acted as obstacles to the monsters, and were dropped in opportune locations to block pursuit. The player could drop up to a dozen of these in their wake and they would disappear slowly over time, allowing the pursuit to continue.</desc>

		<desc>Bounder is back! Again your in control of an tennis ball, that bounces and bounces and bounces... 

This time you must collect smart bombs to finish the game. You need to collect all of them: 16 smart bombs.

Avoid bad stuff for landing like sand, spikes, traps or enemies. Unknown squares, signed with an "?" awaiting you: sometimes helpful (higher/longer jumps, extra-time and soon) - other times they're traps too.

Excellent parallax-scrolling, nice graphics and sounds will give you a great time with this one, easy to play - but damn' hard to win!</desc>

		<desc>The activities of the RAF's famous aircraft display team are brought to life in this simulation. The player can take part in loops, rolls and flypasts, working in tandem with friendly pilots as little as 6ft away, flying at over 300 miles per hour. 

Instructions are given in-flight; follow the requested height and direction to maximise the visual appeal of the routine and to avoid collisions. Thrust and steering can be automated in flight; this invokes a scoring penalty but allows new players to master the more complex functions.</desc>

The game is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks.

		<name>Repton</name>
		<desc>A side scrolling shoot 'em up inspired by Defender, but adding much to the concept. You fly across a looping horizontally-scrolling landscape aiming to protect your base. 

There are a total of eight enemies on screen at any given time. The Quarriers try to build the enemy base by stealing parts of yours. The Drayns steal energy from you and then supply it to the enemy. Fortunately you can steal back the energy they take, but you can't steal back parts of your base. The other six enemies just try to kill you. The bigger the enemy base gets, the more rapidly and accurately they can launch enemies at you.</desc>

		<name>Rescue on Fractalus!</name>
		<desc>Rescue on Fractalus is an action game played from a 3D first person point of view. Your mission is to rescue stranded pilots on the planet of Fractalus. You begin each mission from the mother ship, and when your quota of pilots has been rescued you must return there so you can move on to the next level. To help locate the pilots and navigate the tricky terrain, your spaceship is equipped with various instruments, such as a compass, altimeter, and scanner. Your enemy, the Jaggi's, have numerous forces on this planet and will be attempting to stop you. Gun emplacements, flying saucers, and the Jaggi themselves are all capable of destroying your ship if you don't destroy them first. To defend yourself from these threats, your ship is equipped with torpedoes. As the levels progress, the Jaggi defenses become more aggressive, and you will even need to fly some night missions where visibility is limited!</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Rescue Squad (USA, Europe) (Alt 1).nib</path>
		<name>Rescue Squad</name>
		<desc>This three-part game loosely simulates the work of an ambulance driver rescuing people from a fire. First, you are trying to get across the city, which is represented as a maze of houses, to where a building is on fire. Avoid contact with the houses or other vehicles. A timer counts down from 1000 to zero, representing your score - zero means you're out of time.

There is no fire truck at the building when you arrive, so you have to catch the people who are in the building from falling to their doom, while avoiding falling flower pots. When three flower pots have hit you, this round of the game ends and the fire truck arrives. The goal is therefore to build up as many points as possible by avoiding these pots.

After the fire truck comes, you can enter the blazing building to scour for survivors. You have to rescue everyone in the building before the fires in the building burn you to death. This is done by touching them to lead them, then moving to a window, without being hit by the fireballs.</desc>

		<name>Rick Dangerous</name>
		<desc>You play Rick Dangerous, an Indiana Jones type who's on a quest to find the lost Coolu Amazon tribe.  However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.</desc>

		<desc>You're the president of the Titanic Salvage Company and it's your job to recover any artifacts you can find from the wreck of the H.M.S. Titanic and ultimately raise the ship to the surface.

The game combines both above and below water aspects. Above the water, you must manage the company, press conferences and finances. Below the water, you explore the Titanic and her many secrets by navigating T.S.1 (your underwater robot) through a maze-like environment while trying to find a way to raise the ship to the surface. You must find eight flotation bags in order to raise the vessel.

Along the way, you'll find several hidden items that combine to create yet another item, many of which are required to open locked doors, safes and other hidden compartments.</desc>

		<desc>This game is based on an arcade game that was released by Atari.

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</desc>

		<name>Road Runner</name>
		<desc>This game is based on an arcade game that was released by Atari.

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Road to Moscow (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Road to Moscow</name>
		<desc>Road to Moscow is a strategy war game where you take the role of the German Army trying to take Russia on the Eastern Front in World War 2. The computer takes the role of the Russian Army. The game covers the whole of the Eastern Front from Finland to the Crimea with East at the top of the screen so you have to move your Army upwards. There are 10 skill levels (0 - 9) and you can play a whole campaign starting in 1941 or play four individual campaigns which are 1941 - Invasion, 1942 - 2nd Offensive, 1943 - Russian Offensive and 1944 - Battle for Poland. Each campaign lasts a year and you have two movements a month. 

The idea is to move your units to other parts of the map, once you are happy with your choices the computer calculates how far the units would have moved taking in account of the weather and terrain. Any enemy units in the way will fight the other unit until they are defeated, surrender or retreat. Things to consider when moving is not to move too far from your supply lines as these will make your units useless. The terrain and weather play a big factor as well as attacks from the Russians. Try to complete your campaigns before the Russian winter set in and the Russians built up overwhelming forces. 

The aim of the full campaign is to make the Russians surrender Moscow, Stalingrad, Leningrad and everything West of them. The game is viewed on a small part of the map from above with the units shown as icons.</desc>

		<name>Roadwar 2000</name>
		<desc>Roadwar 2000 is a post-nuclear, turn-based strategy game taking place in the ?last days? of mankind. All of a sudden, a fatal epidemic emerged throughout all of the U.S.A. and spread by some occult and fanatic sect. The epidemic spread over the land in only several months, causing the government to collapse. Anarchy is now everywhere. You are a leader of a street gang and your immediate objective is to acquire as much food and fuel as possible to strengthen your position as a leader of the city. But you and your warriors are not alone; there are other gangs in the city, and they need food and fuel, too. And they want your food and fuel. You must fight against them to defend yourself and to win new loot. As you rise in power as a gang leader, you will be able to totally control several cities. Remember though, your ultimate goal is to find and bring together the eight scientists; only with them can you have a future and survive. Unlike other typical strategy games, you don't have to read a big manual to be capable of playing this game. The game has great depth, and I liked the atmosphere. If you know and like the ?Mad Max? movies, then Roadwar 2000 is definitely something for you.</desc>

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</desc>

		<name>Robots of Dawn</name>
		<desc>In this text adventure based on Isaac Asimov's science fiction detective novel The Robots of Dawn, the player takes the role of Earth detective Elijah Baley, who is sent to the Spacer world of Aurora to investigate the murder of Dr. Han Falstofe, a prominent roboticist and constructor of humaniform robots. Suspects include Falstofe's political and professional rival Dr. Kelden Amadiro, his surrogate daughter Gladia, his biological daughter Vasilia, or ladies' man Gremionis, who was rejected by Gladia. Even Baley's robot friend and partner, R. Daneel Olivaw is not free of suspicion. In addition to the investigation, Baley must also deal with his fear of open spaces on Aurora, a result of having spent his entire life in enclosed spaces on the overcrowded Earth. Also, most Aurorans will not exactly be willing to help Baley due to anti-Earth sentiment.

As typical with adventure games in the detective genre, puzzles are less based on item manipulation but more on gathering evidence and questioning suspects. In each game played, the murderer might be a different one - the location of items and people's reaction to questions differ accordingly. To convict the killer, Baley must determine motive, means and opportunity and present his evidence to the Chairman of Aurora.</desc>

In this licensed game Doc Croc has blown up the printing press, and Lou Brush must go through the sewers to retrieve all 8 pages. After selecting a section from the initial screen of pipes, gameplay involves moving through scrolling platform sections in order to reach the sheets. Once this is done each page is played out as a single-screen multi-layered screen. The specific settings are influenced by the TV show, including Doc Croc's Nursery Crimes, The False Teeth Versus the Atomic Banana, and Kenny McTickle and His Magic Kilt.</desc>

		<name>The Rubicon Alliance</name>
		<desc>In this intergalactic 3D action-flight-simulation your mission is to save the Rubicon, an constructed anti-matter zone that was made by the alliance of the eight planets of the Hyturian system. In 2746 after many centuries of war between the eight planets of the system, they decided to build up this anti-matter zone around the entire system as protection against each others. It worked fine for several decades - the peace remained unthreatened. But now the time has come that the Rubicon barrier has been breached, by the entry of a new planet and its hostile home race, the Space Thugs. Enter your Starfox fighter, save the whole system, and find out who breached the system.

The action is viewed from the cockpit of your starfighter, which is equipped with lasers and side/rear-view mirrors. It also has a status log detailing your weapons and current threats, and an advanced 3-dimensional navigation system called the Holocube. Controlled from a separate screen, the Holocube allows you to rotate a 3D image of space and plot the co-ordinates of your journey. 

The player must manually navigate through wormholes for fast travel - contact with the edges drains your shield. Electrical and ion storms are a constant hazard - the easiest way to avoid these is to use the general log to note their co-ordinates. Weapons can be upgraded

Starfox features eight missions to be completed in order. The first is to shoot down 60 Space Thugs.</desc>

The search starts on the surface of the planet, but also takes Ruff underground into the cavernous regions the Lilli-Punies live in. These have lots of water, which Ruff must avoid. Plenty of extra lives can be collected along the way, with solving puzzles as important as good reactions and dexterity.</desc>

One way or another, this arcade game arms you with a knife and sends you on a kamikaze mission against hordes of enemy fighters. There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters.</desc>

One player controlled a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles passed over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also included a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.</desc>

Your energy recharges if you stay still, so finding areas free of guards (kill these for money) and dogs (avoid them; killing them gains you nothing) is useful, especially as you only have one life.

		<name>Salamander</name>
		<desc>In a distant part of the universe, an alien creature called Zelos was born. As he grew so did his appetite, and soon he began devouring galaxies, planets, and stars by the hundreds. Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action packed shooter based on the arcade game. There are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields. Gameplay is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<name>Sanxion</name>
		<desc>Sanxion is a side-scrolling shoot'em up where you fight your way through wave after wave of colourful enemies, using a futuristic looking aeroplane. The screen is divided in two, with one third at the top of the screen showing a bird's eye panoramic view of the surroundings and your plane, and the two thirds at the bottom showing the actual battlefield. The scrolling speed is controlled by the player, as the scrolling slows down when the plane nears the left side of the screen, and picks up speed as the plane moves towards the middle. Sanxion does not feature any end-bosses or power-ups, instead the player is treated to a non-lethal bonus stage after each completed level, where the aim is to shoot, collect or avoid obstacles in a race against time.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Saracen (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Saracen</name>
		<desc>A combination puzzle/action game from Datasoft.  In each of the 100 levels, the player moves a crusader through an obstacle filled maze trying to reach the Saracen Chief and detonate a bomb next to him.  The chief does not move, instead remaining in a set position.

Along the way, he must avoid roaming guards, bouncing cannonballs, and other traps.  The crusader is armed with a bow and can pick up directionally specific arrows that are used to stop guards or destroy walls. The arrows being limited to shooting in one of the four compass directions is exacerbated by only being able to carry one object (key, arrow or bomb) at a time. For these reasons, the game's puzzle leanings and the need for a methodical approach are strong.

There is generally only one way to solve each level and proper use of the given tools is key to finding it.</desc>

		<desc>A simple variation of the classic game of Mahjongg (also known as Shanghai). Each of the 40 levels consist of rows and piles of tiles, patterned with symbols such as butterflies and masks. Pair them up within the time limit to move on a level. The difficulty is that a tile can only be moved if it has no tile on top of it, and a gap either to the left or right (or both). Careful planning ahead is required if all tiles are to be cleared.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Sargon II (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Sargon II</name>
		<desc>The original SARGON was written by Dan and Kathleen 'Kathe' Spracklen in a Z80-based computer called Wavemate Jupiter III using assembly language through TDL Macro Assembler. The name was originally written entirely in capitals because early computer operating systems such as CP/M did not support lower-case file names. SARGON was introduced at the 1978 West Coast Computer Faire where it won the first computer chess tournament held strictly for microcomputers, with a score of 5-0. This success encouraged the authors to seek financial income by selling the program directly to customers. Since magnetic media were not widely available at the time, the authors placed an advert in Byte Magazine and mailed $15 photocopied listings that would work in any Z80-based microcomputer. Availability of the source code allowed porting to other machines. For example, the March?April 1979 issue of Recreational Computing describes a project that converted Sargon to an 8080 program by using macros. Later the Spracklens were contacted by Hayden Books and a book was published. The Spracklens made significant improvements on the original program and released Sargon II. In 1978 it tied for third at the ninth North American Computer Chess Championship despite being seeded ninth of 12 entries. Sargon finished only behind Belle and Chess 4.7, and defeated AWIT?running on a $5 million Amdahl mainframe?amazing the audience. That year they published a series of articles in BYTE on computer chess programming, stating "we think it would be nice if not everyone had to reinvent the wheel". Sargon II was ported to a variety of personal computers popular in the early 1980s. The game engine featured multiple levels of lookahead to make it more accessible to beginning chess players. BYTE in 1980 estimated that Sargon II had a 1500 rating at the highest tournament-time difficulty level, and speculated that it was the best chess program on sale, including dedicated devices.</desc>

		<desc>Three magic scrolls must be found in the first part of the scrolling hack 'n' slash game, before you can make the journey to defeat your foes and rescue the other wizards in the second part. As with so many Dinamic games, the two parts are loaded separately, but the second can't be accessed until a password (provided at the end of part one) is input.

Contact with the enemies en route (which are mostly mutant demons) drains your limited energy, and you are also working against a time limit on each section. As well as your magical powers (which are stronger in part two), you can collect swords to attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be collected to destroy all enemies on screen. In part two vanquished foes release coins, which can be spent at shop sections on rechargers, shields and teleporters amongst other things.</desc>

		<name>Satans Hollow</name>
		<desc>The player must shoot flying formations of gargoyles in order to pick up pieces of a bridge that must be built over a river of lava. Once the bridge is completed, the player can cross it to face Satan. Destroying him scores bonus points based on the number of waves completed to that point, and also upgrades the rocket launcher. The player then resumes the battle against the gargoyles and must start building a new, longer bridge in order to fight Satan again. The sky darkens on later waves, making it harder to see the enemies. As the game progresses, the gargoyles begin to throw exploding eggs, along with rocks that can destroy bridge sections; the player also occasionally faces disembodied devil heads that float around the screen and spit fire. In addition to firing rockets at the enemies, the player can use a shield that will destroy any enemy touching it. However, this shield can only be used for a short time before it must shut down to recharge. Gargoyles will sometimes attempt to steal a ship from the player's reserve lives, similar to Galaga.</desc>

		<name>Saucer Attack!</name>
		<desc>Aliens in their flying saucers have invaded Earth and have set their sights on destroying the capital of the USA, Washington D.C and all it's landmarks. You have been given the task of destroying the invaders by blasting them with your Energy gun in a bunker outside the city. The game is viewed from a 1st person perspective with the game shown on one screen and you control a gun sight to blast the saucers before facing the Mothership in space. To face and destroy the Mothership you must get 150 points before the aliens get 50 points. Blasting the saucers get you various points while for every three seconds on screen and destroying a landmark, an alien gets points. If the aliens get 50 points or manage to land then it is game over. You start the game in the daytime and the game moves into the evening and then night time for every 50 points. Once you have got 150 points then you can face the Mothership in space and this entails trying to shoot it's Command Module on the top but you can decrease it's shield hitting elsewhere on the ship. The joystick is used to control your gun sight.</desc>

		<desc>Savage contains three different parts, each with its own style. You can play all three, but to get more than one life on levels 2 or 3, you must first input the code earned on completing the previous level.

You play Savage, a muscular warrior who was imprisoned in a castle. When he broke free, he found out that his imprisonment had been a trick with the sole purpose of imprisoning his love, the maiden. You have to progress through the 3 parts of the game to rescue her. 

The first is a simple horizontal-scrolling shooter, in which you use the trajectory of your shots to kill enemies and collect the treasures and improved weapons they drop when killed. The second is a 1st person perspective 3D shooter resembling Space Harrier, with skulls to shoot and monoliths to avoid. In the third you play Savage's Eagle form, flying through platform-style levels avoiding timing-based hazards and shooting anyone who gets in your way.

		<desc>Sega's take on the 1943 style of vertically scrolling shoot 'em ups was set in the future. Your fighter plane is aged and under-powered, yet you must face down large planes, tanks and ground targets to achieve victory. Each level ends with a close-viewed section of particular intensity before finally facing a boss. Smart bombs are occasionally found lying around, and can destroy everything on the screen, although you can't use them on the bosses. A simultaneous 2-player mode is provided.</desc>

The game allows you to get into five buildings which include a jewelery store, a museum, a bank, a research building and an embassy. Each building is more secure and bigger than the last. You need to find loot but the main aim is to find a certain treasure.

There are many security systems in each building including cameras, robots and infa red beams. You have tools to do the job with as well as collecting tools on the way. Every time you are seen the alert goes up but lay low and the alert goes down. Don't lay low too long as there is a time limit. Get caught and it's game over.</desc>

The Synthoid itself cannot move across the level; instead it can look around, accumulate energy by absorbing the objects that are scattered across the landscape, create stacks of boulders, generate inert Synthoid shells and transfer its consciousness from one of these clones to another.</desc>

Scenarios are described in writing with accompanying graphics. The player has to solve puzzles and find out which items are needed and how to react in certain situations in order to make his way to the end of the game. In this game you assume the role of archaeologist Mac Steele who has to find a legendary gem by studying various ancient scrolls which unfortunately were taken from him earlier on by a rival archaeologist. The Serpent's Star is the sequel to Ultrasoft's earlier text graphic adventure Mask of the Sun. Instead of travelling through Mexico this time, Mac Steele is on his way to Tibet and the famous city of Kara-Koram.</desc>

		<desc>Shoot 'em Up Construction Kit is more of a utility than a game. It allows the user to create a huge variety of top down shooters with a simple set of utilities allowing the player to draw, animate and move all of the games sprites, create sound effects and backgrounds for many levels, and set up games rules.

The package comes complete with 4 games already made on it, to demonstrate the techniques involved. These include: "Slap and Tickle" (set in space), "Outlaw" (a wild west game) "Transputer Man" (with a strong sci-fi setting) and "Celebrity Squares".</desc>

		<desc>In The Seven Cities of Gold the player takes on the role of Christopher Columbus and the later Spanish conquistadors, exploring the New World (or a randomly generated map). As the player establishes forts and missions, bringing back gold to Spain, he or she would receive promotions from the Queen of Spain. 

The game features a large world to explore and comes up with some arcade sequences to simulate the interaction of the Natives and Spanish who did not speak the same language. The historical map accurately spreads out the Native population of the New World in 1492 and some historical situations can be simulated, such as whether to get the gold of the Aztec and Incas by trade or conquest.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Shadow Warriors (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Shadow Warriors</name>
		<desc>Shadow Warriors is a direct port of the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden. It is a beat'em up in the veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world prophecies.

Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with 5 units.

The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.

A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.</desc>

Getting through the game means surviving the traps and monsters spread throughout the dungeon. You must also get past the wrong turns. To get by the monsters, you must either avoid them, or use a weapon (limited shots).

Throughout the dungeon are treasure chests, cache's of useful things, such as keys and hints.</desc>

Each level is broken down into smaller scenes and hostages are guarded by big blokes who throw swords. Watch out for gun-toting enemy henchmen and ninjas.

Reaching the end of each level will find you battling it out with a boss. These range from 8ft giants to helicopter gunships.</desc>

		<desc>Wait, you say, wasn't this an Infocom title? Actually, this one came out first on the budget publisher Mastertronic's catalog. It's a vastly different game than the Infocom one - you wander around as one of a number of characters trying to build up your rapport with the people, doing battle and working your way up to becoming a shogun. An obscure title that I always loved - and the very odd graphics and gameplay, on a 2D surface  where you're always flying everywhere, were so strange, but in the end that made it a memorable game.</desc>

		<desc>The space station Sigma 7 has a problem: all robots have gone havoc. Now the player has to set things right by using the central controls inside the station - but of course it is not that easy. He first have to solve three levels with different gameplay mechanics:

The first is a diagonally scrolling shooter which plays very basic: don't getting hit by the mines which come in formations of three. It is best to shoot them, however, because surviving mines may come back from the side, which is deadly. After reaching the station, the game becomes a Pac-Man variant. In a maze-like field the player needs to pick up glowing balls on the floor without being touched by the enemies. But there are two important differences: the player controls a tank, i.e. he can shoot the foes, and he doesn't have to pick up all balls. If he got enough, he can simply use the exit. However, a few balls can't be picked up and the pattern needs to be remembered</desc>

For a long while after Pearl Harbor, you are the only forces capable of striking back at the Japanese in the Pacific. Take one of the "fleet boats" and go on extended patrols of up to 2 months from Hawaii, Australia, or New Zealand. Set your difficulty/realism level and time period (early means less tech for juicier targets, later means tougher escorts, more tech, lousier targets).

You can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war.

		<name>Silicon Dreams</name>
		<desc>This interactive fiction game is a trilogy of the Level 9's adventures Snowball, Return to Eden, and Worm in Paradise. These had previously been released for some but not all of these systems.

Silicon Dreams can be played as three separate games, but to obtain the maximum number of points, you must complete them in order (carrying your score from one adventure to the next). Snowball has graphics for the first time, and the other two games have more graphics than before, and some longer text descriptions are added to all 3 games.

Snowball: As Kim Kimberley, your mission is to safeguard the colonization ship Snowball 9 and its passengers. When you are awakened prematurely from hibernation, you know something's wrong!

Return to Eden: Your objective is to get into the new city of Enoch, and stop the Eden robots from destroying Snowball 9.

Worm in Paradise: You have to find as much information about the city as possible, obtain money, and then become a member of the governing party of Eden.</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons : Bart vs the Space Mutants</name>
		<desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield. On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.</desc>

		<name>Skate Crazy</name>
		<desc>Pull on your skates and get down to the local car park where your prowess on eight wheels is put to the test in the 'Car Park Challenge'. 

The player grooves his way around one level of the car park which has been turned into a multidirectionally scrolling arena for the gladiators of roller racing. Kick cans over, litter to collect and obstacles to avoid in the shape of cones, ramps, sand, bouncing balls, flying frisbees, mazes of tyres and rocks, and even other skaters. Finishing each level is a battle against time to negotiate a series of gates in a set order, the next gate being signified by a row of dots which flash between its flags. 

To complete rounds successfully, though, suitably impressive stunts and tricks are carried out to appease a set of four judges. Each have a card which they periodically display at the bottom of the screen, notifying the player of his progress. When the player's energetic jumping skills have gained enough points to qualify, he skates through the finishing gate and has his performance rated. Failing to qualify forces the player to skate around the car park against the clock, picking up a set number of pieces of litter. Beating a level allows the player to skate to the level's exit ramp, from where he chooses to move up to the next level or leave the car park and move onto the next part of the game, 'The Skate Crazy Championship Course'. 

This section of the game is a race against time over four horizontally scrolling cityscapes of platforms and ramps, with the player building up speed on his skates using a paced joystick waggling movement. Ground level obstacles and gaps in the floor are crossed with leaps of controllable strength and items at head height are avoided by judicious ducking. Birds and other creatures also spell doom for the heroic skater, unless he is able to avoid them or throw things at them. 

Points are scored in this section by picking up extra skating paraphernalia, such as pads, clothes, skates and litter.</desc>

		<name>Skate or Die!</name>
		<desc>Skate or Die incorporates five distinct styles of skating, which can be attempted individually or in turn. You skate around a menu room to choose which one to attempt. Before taking off you can visit Rodney's skate shop to buy equipment.

The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is to score as many points as possible in 10 attempts. Judges determine how much style and skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same equipment, only this time your task is to jump as high as possible at the end of the ramp.

The downhill events are overhead-view races. In the Downhill Race you simply try to complete the course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you try to outperform a human or computer opponent whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You can use attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock your opponent over. 

The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up using a stick, set within a pit to skate around.</desc>

The gameplay is flown in third-person perspective, while you are controlling your vehicle (skimmer or skybike) always flying forward. Moving left or right allows you to avoid the obstacles such as trees, accelerating and decelerating changes the speed, and shooting keeps you alive. Harvester is a boss, which appears after certain number of enemies will be eliminated, and it should be destroyed. Upon defeating the harvester the game awards the player with money, and loops back to the moment of time, when player controlled the skimmer. Collision with any obstacle means game over.

Hi-score table allows you to see the most successful Skyrunners.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Skyfox II - The Cygnus Conflict (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Skyfox II</name>
		<desc>Skyfox II is a space combat shooter, with many different missions and detailed bitmap graphics that was advanced for its time. The gameplay is fast, fun, and surprisingly varied. You will pilot a starfighter on a variety of missions, from locating lost artifacts to destroying the enemy. The enemy ships, Xenomorph fighters in particular, are a far cry from dummy ships of most early shooters: they will dodge your fire, gang up on you, and are deadly accurate with their attack.
Skyfox II also features some simulation and strategy elements, you can plan your attack, set a course on the overview map, and use autopilot mode. You also have to refuel once in a while, and this naturally puts you in a vulnerable position as enemy ships are always around.
Overall, Skyfox II is perfect for fans of space simulations who want some arcade fun, and arcade fans who want something a bit more complex than Space Invaders.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Slam-Dunk (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Slam-Dunk</name>
		<desc>Slam-Dunk is a two on two basketball game. Play against the computer or against another player. The game is divided into 4 quarters of three minutes each. The team with the highest score at the end of the final quarter wins. An overtime session can occur if the game ends in a tie. 

The game provides a practice session. Here you can learn the moves and plays needed to beat your opponent.

You control one of your players on your team. Your teammate will be controlled by the computer, based on your movements of the controllable player. On offense, you control the man with the ball. On defense, you control the man guarding the ball. On defense, you can switch your controllable player by moving the joystick right while pressing the button. 

In this fast paced game, fouling can occur if defense plays too close or offense shoves its way into a defensive man. After five fouls, free throws will be shot. If you're shooting free throws, simply hit the button to take the shot. Made free throws count as one point.

Keep an eye on the shot clock. Don't get caught holding the ball. Remember that any shot taken and made outside the three-point line is worth three points.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Slamball (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Slamball</name>
		<desc>The big and nasty Americana monster has come along and eaten up Mastertronic's pinball table where the Slamball family resides, a living clan of ball bearings with a happy deposition. The pinball table is inside the monster's stomach and the balls are in a bit of trouble. The pinball table is still operational, and since the monster's stomach knows that the family is still inside, it has decided to eject them one by one. The hole at the bottom of the table, which normally recovers the ball, instead slides down into the monster's digestive tract. 

Luckily for you, as a member of the secret society of prevention of cruelty to pinballs, have gained radio remote control of the table, and you must now stop at nothing to prevent any of the Slamball family from getting into the Americana Monster's digestive tract.

The whole game revolves around a vertically scrolling window of four screens that form the entire length of the table. As you launch the ball, you need to decide on the power at which the ball is ejected into the playfield. Four sets of flippers are positioned throughout the table; with the left and right flippers being controlled by pushing left or right on the joystick, respectively. 

All the elements of a real pinball table, such as bumpers and rollbacks, are included here. Even a nudge is implemented in times of extreme danger. Hitting nudge causes the whole table to wobble, and nudge is useful when a member of the Slamball family is in danger of entering the digestive tract. If the nudge gets overused, then the flippers are disabled until the ball reaches the Monster's alimentary canal.

Around the table are a number of enzymes which are held in groups of up to four. If a slamball comes into contact with these enzymes, the enzymes themselves disappear, and when an entire group is destroyed, a blob appears. If a slamball destroys this blob before it destroys itself by hitting the table's walls, the score multiplier is increased. If all the enzymes are destroyed, the level is complete and a bonus for any balls left is awarded.</desc>

		<name>Slugger</name>
		<desc>In this early UK-developed baseball simulation, one or two player matches can be played over 3,6 or 9 innings, with 3 different computer skill levels. The rules are explained by some introductory screens, and the game is fully faithful to these. Gameplay is in an arcade/action style, so you don't need to worry about statistics for different teams or players. 

The main viewing area is a forced-perspective view of the field, with a small side-viewed window of the pitcher's delivery itself. When fielding, control automatically goes to the player nearest to the ball, but a point doesn't end until the pitcher has the ball back (unless it is a home run). Features include stealing bases, pitching curve balls, or customizing the colors of each team.

The game has been presented with considerable glitz, with cheerleaders on screen between innings and lots of advertising boards and other slogans.</desc>

Using the SnoopNet computer, players will comb the streets of the neighborhood looking for clues, and investigating people's houses while they're away. Speed is of the essence, as if your Snooper Troop is caught when the owner of the house returns home, you could be thrown off the case for good!

The title encourages players to keep facts on people, map the neighborhood, review clues, receive special messages, and ultimately, find enough information to accuse and convict the criminal trying to chase the Kim family out their home.</desc>

In the air you can fight the MiG-27, Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 armed with heat or radar guided missiles!

You can choose to be an existing pilot or to create a new one. 
You can choose between 2 levels of difficulty: beginner (less enemy attacks) or expert (the most dangerous).
The weather will affect the mission. The good weather will be great for training, and the stormy will be dangerous but great for attacks, as you can hide into the clouds and approach the enemy unnoticed.
You'll have a copilot that will help you telling what's going on every moment. 
You can avoid missiles using your skills, using chaff or... if you can't, you can use your parachute!</desc>

		<desc>Soko-Ban is a classic puzzle game, the basis of numerous clones in the later years. It is set in a warehouse. On each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.</desc>

		<desc>Krillys has stolen the Zodiac Power Source and broken it into six pieces, and Sarnak has been sent to find it and hopefully rescue his friends Teron, Gorman and Tartarus. He travels through the Ebbedown Forest initially, with gameplay similar to Ghosts and Goblins. 

The journey is largely from left to right, although downward movements through gaps and upward movements on rotating platforms are also frequent. Some drops can be fatal, but mostly those which have a platform in close reach, so these are avoidable and not purely random. There are many magic teleports en route, and the high trees narrow the journey. Extra lives (via collecting 8 crystals) and improved weaponry are on offer throughout your quest.</desc>

		<desc>Solo Flight is a flight simulator game for the Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit family, and Apple II series released in 1983. It was later released for the IBM PC.

The mission of the game is to fly solo over several states, delivering bags of mail. The game supported a fairly realistic flight model (for the time), and a large number of flight instruments were available. A map covering many states of the US was used, which even included altitude data (although the landscape always appeared flat due to the technology constraints of the time).</desc>

		<name>Solo Flight - 2nd Edition</name>
		<desc>Solo Flight: 2nd Edition is a new version of the original flight simulator Solo Flight and once again allows you to fly a small plane, the Ryan ST-A with a new look cockpit instrument panel. At the start of the game you have two options, whether to fly the plane for practise or fly the plane for a mail run. You have the choice of six American states to fly over (instead of three in the original) which are Kansas, Washington, Colorado, Michigan, Massachusetts or Texas, each having their own weather and terrain. The games viewpoint is a 3rd person perspective behind the plane again with the joystick and keyboard to control your plane. The game also included speech to help you in flying by giving instructions as you fly.

In Mail Run you have been given the task of delivering the mail from your home runway to either one other airport or various airports. There are four difficulty levels (Student, Private, Senior or Command). Before your flight you must re-fuel your plane taking note of the weight of the plane and you can decide how many airports you wish to fly to. 

In practise flying you have 4 levels of difficulty (Clear, Landing, Contest or IFR). Clear allows you to fly in good weather, Landing is practising landing, Contest gives you a score for your landings and IFR is flying in low level clouds with zero visibility so you can only rely on your instrument panel. You also can fly in the day or at night.

The actual flying part has you sat on a runway and using the keyboard and joystick you take off into the sky and using the joystick control the plane. A map can be brought up to make sure your in the right direction. Once you have reached another airport you are able to land.</desc>

There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the effect used in many car games such as Outrun.

The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new ones as well.</desc>

		<desc>Space Pilot is a clone of Time Pilot, a 1982 arcade game by Konami. The game takes place in the sky, which scrolls freely in eight directions, without any restrictions or obstacles whatsoever. The player controls a fighter airplane, which is capable of flying in any direction. The enemies also take the form of various aircraft, and fly in various directions. On each level, the player's task is to destroy a certain number of enemy aircraft, after which a "boss" enemy appears. Destroying this enemy advances the game onto the next level. There are five levels, set in various years: 1919, 1940, 1970, 1984 and 2001. On the first, second, and fourth levels, the enemies are various types of airplanes. On the third level they are helicopters and on the fifth level they are UFOs.</desc>

		<name>Space Shuttle : A Journey into Space</name>
		<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>

		<name>Space Station Oblivion</name>
		<desc>A 3D strategy / action game featuring scaling and rotating polygon graphics, Driller features 18 different areas to explore, each with its own unique laws of physics and logic, and a number of secret rooms and hidden levels to discover.

The player is an exile, Lesleigh Skerrit, who was falsely accused of murder. Mitral - a moon of the planet Evath - has become unstable, and a dangerous gas buildup threatens to cause an explosion that will destroy Mitral and devastate Evath. Lesleigh has an opportunity to redeem himself and become an Elite in the Driller Federation by piloting an excavation probe "Last Hope" and placing eighteen drilling rigs in various sectors of Mitral to avert the imminent disaster. In each sector, Lesleigh must locate the build-up area, then drill to vent the gas into space.</desc>

		<desc>Piloting a Space Taxi, you must pick up passengers from "pads" and carry them to whatever other pads they wish to go. Space Taxi features 25 screens with varying obstacles and challenges that must be navigated in order to collect your fare. Although Space Taxis sort of resemble yellow Checker Cabs, they operate on a different principle - the longer you take to deliver a passenger, the less money you collect. In addition to watching the clock because of an incentive to collect money, players have to be aware of their fuel supply. Run out of fuel, and you will crash.</desc>

		<name>Spare Change</name>
		<desc>In Spare Change, you are the owner and operator of the Spare Change Arcade, dedicated to making your place of business run as smoothly as possible. Inside the arcade are Token machines, jukeboxes, telephones, movie booths, popcorn machines, and so on. The token machines need to be restocked with money from the cash register when they are out of tokens, but eventually, the register must be replenished with cash from the safe. You must drop the tokens in one of your two storage bins. When you have stored at least ten tokens, the movie booth opens, and you can go inside to proceed to the next level. You are also awarded one bag of money, but if you store more than ten tokens, then more than one bag of money is awarded for each extra token collected. If nine bags of money are obtained, you proceed to the next level.

But the Zerks, two aliens that run around the screen, can steal tokens either from the machines or from the storage bins. Sometimes, a Zerk will toss a token to the other nearest the "piggy bank". You must touch them in order to get the token back, before they throw it in their piggy bank. Alternatively, you can throw a token into the jukebox, telephone, popcorn machine, etc. and the Zerks will get distracted from their goal, giving you enough time to continue filling the storage bins. If the Zerks insert five tokens in the piggy bank, the game is over.

Between levels, an intermission plays, which are similar to those in Pac-Man. Later in the game, you have the ability to access these intermissions. As you proceed through the levels, the game gets quite difficult.</desc>

		<desc>Buggy Boy is a race game, but not just an ordinary race game. There are five different routes, offroad, north, east, west, south. The offroad course loops around back to the start, the others are long runs with a distinct beginning and ending. You must complete each leg before the time runs out.

Along the way you can pick up all kinds of bonuses. The colored flags are 30 points each, collect all colors in the order as indicated at the top of the screen to get 1000 bonus points. There are several gates the give you 100, 250 or 500 points, and a time gate. Drive through a time gate to collect it, you receive two seconds extra time upon completing a leg. Occasionally there will be a soccer ball on the road, hit it and it will fly away and you get 2000 points. 

There are bridges and tunnels, be careful not to fall off the bridge into the water or crash into the tunnel wall. There also are obstacles like boulders, logs and fences. If you hit them it will cost you valuable seconds off your leg time. But if you hit a log or small stone just right, the buggy will ride on two wheels until you hit something again.</desc>

Before you race you can choose the amount of laps (two, four or six) and your skill level (Novice, Champion or Pro). The race has a 3rd person perspective as you watch from behind your rider and try to beat 19 other riders. The joystick is used to control your bike. Besides controlling your speed you also have six gears which need to be changed manually. Once you have finished a race the lap-times are saved and it's time to choose another track..</desc>

		<desc>It's the 21st century in America. Technology has improved by leaps and bounds, and now (most) people live in peace. But in a small town somewhere, a vicious terrorist group known as Zapper is terrorizing small towns and kidnapping innocent people so that they can build a secret weapon. And, as it turns out, the family and friends of someone code-named "Super Joe" just so happened to be one of the innocents caught! Now Super Joe's hungry for revenge. Can Super Joe and his armored car destroy the Zapper organization and save his town from utter destruction in time?

The Speed Rumbler is a action game where the player races against the clock in an armored car piloted by Super Joe, destroying other cars and saving captives along the way. Super Joe's car is armed with a gun that he can use to shoot down enemy cars, but the enemy cars have a few tricks up their sleeve, so Super Joe should always be on guard. As the player progresses through the game's six stages, Super Joe can be given a boost by saving captives, who then award him with bonus points, increased fire power, or speed-ups. If Super Joe's car is destroyed, he can continue the fight on foot with his rifle. But unfortunately, Super Joe is not as powerful as his car - one hit and he's history.

Super Joe has 24 "hours" to destroy Zapper. The game is over when Super Joe runs out of lives or time - or if he successfully completes his mission.</desc>

The ball must be thrown into the goal at your opponent's end. Any amount of physical contact can be made, and there are no illegal ways to get the ball or the goal.

Before each match you can bribe the referee into awarding you a head-start or strengthening the abilities of your players. You compete in a simple knockout cup tournament, or in individual 2-player games.</desc>

		<name>Spell of Destruction</name>
		<desc>Spell of Destruction is about a magician guild which requires a special final test for its students. The protagonist Drinn has to retrieve the "First Element" from a dangerous castle.

The game is an isometric action game with puzzle elements.The player commands Drinn through the castle rooms (which scroll as long as no door is entered) and solve puzzles by using the correct items or spells. Spells are limited, though, and have to be found in the castle rooms. To dispatch of the numerous foes he uses either fireball spells or his sword for direct combat. If an enemy launches an successful attack on Drinn or touches him, the life energy drains an if it reaches zero, the protagonist dies. Spells and commands have to be chosen with the keyboard and then triggered with the joystick.

Besides special spells for puzzles and fireball there are two other standard spells available: find it (shows the location of hidden chests) and tell tale (gives a hint how to proceed). If a critical spell is wasted or Drinn dies the game has to be restarted from the beginning.</desc>

		<desc>Solomon's Key is a clear conceptual influence for this action puzzler. Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks.

Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.</desc>

		<desc>Solomon's Key is a clear conceptual influence for this action puzzler. Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks.

Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.</desc>

		<name>Amazing Spider-Man, The</name>
		<desc>In The Amazing Spider-Man, Spider Man has to rescue his girlfriend Mary Jane who was been kidnapped by the super villain Mysterio. The whole game takes place on a film set studio.

This game is primarily a platforming game in which Spider-Man fights against various enemies. Those can be stunned with Spider-Man's iconic web substance, but touching them or other hazards in the game world will decrease his health. Another important part of the gameplay are puzzles, mostly with the goal to deactivate some of Mysterio's gimmicks, e.g. changed gravity, to clear the path. Spider-Man can climb walls and shoot grappling hooks.</desc>

		<name>Spike's Peak + Ghost Manor</name>
		<desc>Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain! Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.</desc>

		<desc>As GERALD (Gyroscopic ExploRAtion Landing Device) you must explore 385 screens of Hangworld, using limited fuel. The game is viewed isometrically, which means that the controls are rotated through 90 degrees - this, coupled with the fact that many screens have huge gaps and diagonal paths, means that it's hard to get far at first. Falling off ledges loses you time, which is very limited to start with

Gerald must collect energy crystals throughout his journey - which can also be shortened by using a complex system of lifts. Sections you have travelled through are automatically mapped.</desc>

		<desc>Spooks is an action-adventure game where the goal is to collect eight musical boxes and play them at the exit. The game is set in and around a large mansion which is haunted by four ghosts against which you can defend by throwing large or heavy objects at. Around the mansion there are many rooms and many items whose function you need to figure out in order to complete the game. Adding to the suspense is the need to be on alert for the ghosts as they move quite fast and also that when in inventory menu you only get a short time to make your decisions.</desc>

		<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>

		<name>Star Control</name>
		<desc>Star Control is a science-fiction wargame which pits the forces of the Alliance of Free Stars against those of the predatory Ur-Quan Hierarchy. The games are designed so that you can ease into play, familiarizing yourself with menus, options and player controls. 
The Alliance and Hierarchy each possess different types of warships. Each vessel has its own maneuvering and firing characteristics, plus a unique special power that you can employ when circumstances dictate.

The game has two modules: the Melee, in which you can simply blast the computer or another player to smithereens using one of 16 different ships, in either Hierarchy or Alliance fleets; or, should you wish for a more challenging game, lets you play one of 9 preset scenarios.</desc>

		<name>Star Fleet I - The War Begins!</name>
		<desc>Starfleet I: The War Begins is a 1984 strategy computer game designed by Trevor Sorensen and developed by Interstel (some versions by Cygnus Multimedia). It was released for Apple II, DOS and Commodore 64. Versions for the Commodore 128 (bundled together as Commodore 64/128, though it included a discrete version for the 128 with 80-column support,) Atari ST and Atari 8-bit were released in 1986 and versions for the Amiga and Macintosh were released in 1987. The game was successful enough to spawn sequels which are collectively known as the Star Fleet series.

The game resembles the Star Trek text game. The player is a new graduate of Starfleet Academy in command of a starship. The Federation is at war with the Krellans and Zaldrons, so the player has plenty of combatants to engage from the beginning. Eschewing digital graphics, Star Fleet I presents all its information in color ASCII characters. Gameplay centers on two main activities: navigation and combat. Navigation takes place on the Main Computer GUI. It consists of a main star chart map, the player's current position, and visual displays. Other information may be accessed using appropriate commands. Navigation may be conducted manually or automatically</desc>

		<name>Star League Baseball</name>
		<desc>In this traditional baseball simulation, gameplay takes place mainly on a split screen.One side shows an overview of the field, the other showing the batter, with the latter view disappearing when the ball is hit. The game requires you to "draft" a team before play, composing the best possible squad based on each player's skill attributes. The game also allows a semblance of managerial control, and has an optional batting practice mode to warm up. It then allows you to play individual games, or participate in a 4 division, 24-team championship.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars - Return of the Jedi</name>
		<desc>The arcade game from Atari based on the third Star Wars movie features three action sequences inspired by the film. You control Princess Leia on a speeder bike racing through the forests on Endor. You have to evade trees and deal with enemy troopers by shooting at them or luring them into Ewok traps. In the second sequence, you control Chewbacca who has captured an Imperial AT-ST Walker, evading tree traps and shooting at enemy walkers. In this sequence, the perspective sometimes switches to the Millennium Falcon which you must guide through a fleet of enemy Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters. In the final sequence, the Millennium Falcon enters the Death Star and has to make its way to the reactor, surviving more TIE Fighters and laser turrets. Once the reactor is destroyed, you have to get out again before the explosion engulfs the ship. After the Death Star has been destroyed, the game restarts at the first sequence, but with a higher difficulty.</desc>

Shot enemies release letters, which must then be flown over. Once an area is cleared, you must use the letters to form a word. Then, fly through the time gate, and decide which historical event the word relates to.</desc>

Destroy enemy military radar, bunkers,etc; to get more points. Use yellow energy fields for increasing your fuel level, but avoid the red energy fields. Once you destroy the Tower, you go onto a tougher level with the same basic objective. (Description from Moby Games)</desc>

		<name>Stellar 7</name>
		<desc>Gir Draxon, Supreme Overlord of the Arcturan Empire has declared war on the Terran Federation. The leaders of Earth respond by sending the Terran Fleet on their way to Arcturus to intercept Draxon's armada. But this was a deadly mistake: the Arcturans have discovered warplinks, which allow them to transport troops from one link to another instantaneously, even across vast interstellar distances. With the fleet halfway across the galaxy, the enemy has already reached the Sol system and occupied Saturn's moon Titan. Now, humanity's only hope is the experimental Raven armored vehicle. One courageous pilot must take the Raven through seven different star systems, from Titan to Arcturus, defeating any and all Arcturans, using the warplinks to travel from one system to the next.

Stellar 7 is a first-person action game inspired by Atari's Battlezone, with similar wireframe graphics. In each of the seven levels, the player must defeat a number of enemies. Doing so reveals the warplink that takes the Raven to the next system. 

Next to a cannon, the Raven is equipped with radar, shields, and a cloaking device. The cloak drains the energy level of the vehicle substantially, and the depletion of the energy reserves or the shields destroys the Raven. Some of the levels include fuel bays that allow the player to recharge the energy.

Various enemies await on the different worlds. These include both ground vehicles (sleds, tanks, hovercraft) and aircraft as well as stationary laser turrets, homing bombs, robot drones and more. All enemies vary in firepower, speed and armor ratings. An in-game mission briefing introduces most adversaries, but some special ones come as surprises.</desc>

		<name>Street Cred Boxing</name>
		<desc>An consortium from some yuppie executives want the building that houses Joe Lebrinskis' Gym on the East side, and the cost to save it is $50,000. Without the money you and the other four members have decided to train and face the yuppie's goons from the West Side by completing two training exercises before facing them in the street. 

To make sure only the best five boxers are good enough, each fighter must spend 20 seconds on the punch bag with you waggling the joystick left and right as fast as you can for each boxer. The more punches hit, the more a bar grows at the bottom of the screen grows and when it turns yellow then the fighter can move onto the next exercise. Fail to get yellow and the fighter can't fight. The screen shows the top half of the boxer from the side.

If any fighters have qualified then they can spar with six boxers. All six boxers must be defeated so the more boxers you have the better chances of beating them. Two bars at the top of the screen shows each boxers energy bar. Hitting the other boxer decreases their bar and if it reaches zero then they are defeated. If your boxer is defeated then another qualified boxer steps in. Fail to beat all six boxers then it's game over. The screen is viewed from the side with the screen scrolling a short distance to the left or right when your boxer moves.

Any boxer that qualified but lost in the sparring exercise can still fight so it's onto the streets to face six of the yuppie's goons. The screen is viewed from the side with the screen scrolling from left to right as your boxer moves. As with the sparring both fighters have an energy bar and hitting decreases it. Defeat a goon and you walk to the right to face the next one. Lose all your boxers remaining and it' s game over, defeat six goons and you have saved the gym.</desc>

		<desc>You are Ryu, a Street Fighter. Your goal is to travel to 5 countries (Japan, USA, England, China and Thailand) and beat 2 enemies at each of them. Many of these characters, such as Adon, Gen, and Birdie, are later seen in the Street Fighter Alpha series.

After each country you will have the chance to get additional points in a little bonus round, a feature seen later in most Street Fighter games. 

The final boss in the game is Sagat, who is the second to the last boss in Street Fighter 2. The goal is to become the greatest fighter in the world. As with most tournament fighting games once you have defeated the boss the game will reset and start from the beginning with a harder difficulty level. 

It is possible to start a two player game but there will be only one fight (between the two players) which will determine who will travel the globe to fight the computer controlled opponents.</desc>

So in conclusion Mickey walks from left to right while defending himself again the enemy hordes. The game plays out as a standard brawler in which Mickey uses hand-to-hand combat against the foes. However, when he gets the hand of them he also can use other items like guns, baseball bats or teargas. Being hit by opponents, which sometimes hide in garbage bins, drain Mickey's energy and eventually one of his lives.</desc>

		<name>Street Rod</name>
		<desc>The player starts off on the garage, where cars and parts may be purchased from the newspaper. New parts that are purchased must be installed by the player by entering the hood of or going under the car and then removing a series of screws to remove parts of the engine and transmission. Then, these parts must be re-installed in order and the bolts replaced, otherwise the car will be undrivable. To install tires, the car must be jacked up. While racing, the car will eventually run out of fuel, which the player must obtain from the gas station. The player will proceed from the garage to the local diner in order to find some competition to race. Races take place on either a dragstrip (drag race option) or an open country road. Wagers on the drag races can be set from "Just for kicks!" (no wager) to $10 and $50. On the road race wagers can be set from $25 to $100 and "pink slips" (the winner receives the loser's car). When the race starts, the player must wait for a signal to be given to go or else they forfeit the race. If the player's car doesn't have an automatic transmission, they can either "drop their transmission" during the race if they keep accelerator pressed while shifting gears, or blow the engine if the tachometer dial is in the red zone for too much. In either case, the player would lose the bet they made and would be transported back to the garage, where they have to get new parts for their car. If the player crashes their car during the race, they can get the car fixed for a fee, or have it scrapped and receive the scrap value. However, if they get involved in a serious crash or the car has already been repaired several times before, they are only able to receive the car's scrap value. During the road race the player would occasionally also get chased by police. If the player attempts to evade the police and keeps speeding, they will be fined $75 if caught. If the player slows down, they will be fined $20. Either instance results in the race being forfeited. If the player can't afford to pay the fine, they will be sent to prison. If the player doesn't have a car and their amount of money is not enough to buy the cheapest car, the game is over. The challenge is to beat The King in a road race. If you win, you get the King's car and girlfriend, and you become the new King.</desc>

		<desc>This American football game is played on the street with three players on each team, picked from the local neighbourhood kids. Each kid has his own skill. There are three positions, Quarterback and two receivers. The idea is to get the ball to the other side of the street. The team attacking has four plays to move 10 yards by either throwing or running with the ball. If the defence can stop the other team moving more than 10 yards in four plays then they get the ball. 

The game is viewed from the side. Here you can select which play to use. When happy with your play you control the quarterback. Move him/her in any direction with the joystick. If you want to pass then press the fire button. 

There are plenty of options including how many points, how many plays etc. You can even design your own plays.</desc>

He is Hiryu, Super A-Class Strider. His mission is to defeat the Grand Master and put an end to his plotting once and for all.

Converted from the classic arcade game, Strider lets you run, jump, perform acrobatics and climb walls and overhangs. You wield a plasma sword, called a Cypher, through 5 levels fighting robots and guards, with mid- and end-level bosses.</desc>

		<name>Strike Aces</name>
		<desc>Strike Aces is a flight simulator designed to give players a feel for the quick decision-making process that real pilots need to fly. It takes place at the Strategic Air Command Bombing and Navigation Competition, a real-life event that occurs every year at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. The best aircrews from around the world and some of the best aircraft come to participate in a series of three missions that are constantly monitored, with points awarded to aircrews in various categories. In the end, the aircrew that has gained the post points receives the Curtis E. LeMay trophy.

In this game, you are the pilot of one of these aircrews with a choice of flying one of six aircraft, and your missions will pit you against any of seven additional enemy aircraft (although you will not get to fly them). To practice flying, you can do a Free Flight; when you're ready to compete, you will get to complete a series of 16 missions. You can also design your own missions, if you like.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/PP/Strike Force Harrier (USA, Europe).nib</path>
		<name>Strike Force Harrier</name>
		<desc>Rod Hyde was always determined to produce the most realistic and advanced flight simulations ever, and this early attempt at recreating the Harrier is an example of that. There are 3 skill levels, as well as two practice modes - one for the rudiments of flight and the other for combat. The action-centered nature of the title means that it can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather than a pukka flight simulator.

Acquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made easier by the advanced targeting technology of the planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks clears ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) is correctly implemented, although more traditional horizontal take-offs should be used when space permits. The full range of weapons are provided; experience will tell you which to use in which situations, based on enemy volume and range.</desc>

		<name>Summer Games II</name>
		<desc>Eight Olympic events feature in this game, and any selection of these can be played at a time. There is no pure sprinting, and only the rowing and cycling can be thought of as pure joystick-waggling. The triple jump involves pressing right to start the hop (before reaching the white line), right again for the step as you land, left as you land for the jump, and then up to propel you through the sand.  I high jump, after selecting a height you feel you can clear, you use up and down to control the speed, fire to jump, and then forward to propel you over the bar.

For the javelin even you hold down fire to build up speed, and push left to throw the javelin, holding it left before releasing to change the angle. In the equestrian event, you must use up to increase speed, and fire or right to jump when appropriate to clear the hazards - too many faults will see you disqualified.

Fencing involves moving your foil using the joystick, always staying one step ahead of your opponent, retreating when appropriate. The kayaking event involves navigating a river by controlling the direction, ensuring that all the gates are past correctly even when this requires some precise lining up. You can also load the events from Summer Games 1 in, to play all 16 events in a marathon session.</desc>

		<desc>Super Boulder Dash is a compilation including the original Boulder Dash and it's sequel, Boulder Dash II. In each of these games you control Rockford on a quest to recover diamonds from numerous caves. The caves contain numerous (falling) boulders, walls, and assorted creatures that all get in your way! Each game contains both an action and strategy element; you'll need to run fast to avoid creatures and falling boulders, but also need to carefully plot your course through the cave to avoid becoming trapped. When you have collected enough diamonds on the current level, you can make your way to the exit for the next, more difficult round. To make the games more challenging, each level has a time limit for completion.</desc>

		<desc>A simple action game where the player is a rabbit who must cross the screen initially from left to right avoiding the various nasty critters in their way.

When the player reaches the right hand side of the screen their goal is to claim the carrot that is being dangled in front of them. If they get the carrot they are transformed into Super Bunny and must begin their journey back across the screen. In this super powered form the player can take revenge and defeat the critters standing in their way.

Super Bunny is similar to "cross the road" games such as the arcade game Frogger and Activision's Freeway.

The original box came with a complete "Super Bunny" comic book written and illustrated by air-brush artist Martin Cannon, staff artist at Datamost.</desc>

There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on the usual handling and power upgrades, as well as forward-shooting missiles. You must finish in the top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game You can upgrade your car throughout the game via the shop section. You are given an initial price, but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman ? get the right combination and the price will drop.</desc>

		<desc>In a very good adaptation of one of the lesser-known Pac-Man sequels, Super Pac-Man speeds up the action -- and drastically shortens the effectiveness of the power pills and super power pills gobbled up by Pac-Man. If you think you've mastered the original arcade version -- either with the benefit of a lot of quarters or Namco Museum -- this version of Super Pac-Man may yet humble you with its faster pace. Graphically, this is a better translation of its source material than the original Pac-Man for the 5200 was, and the sound is almost a dead-ringer for the arcade game.</desc>

		<name>Super Zaxxon</name>
		<desc>Super Zaxxon is a three-quarter perspective, space shooter style game. You must first go over a base on an asteroid. Things located on this base include gun implacements, fuel tanks, radar stations, missiles, and fighters. After you successfully navigate this base, you will go through a tunnel to tangle with enemy fighters, mine layers, and mines. You then will have to navigate through a series of barriers on another asteroid in order to take on the Super Zaxxon's, the enemy robot dragons. The game is very similar in appearance to Zaxxon. The differences are: Your fighter moves much faster. This makes going after ground targets a big challenge. The graphics are different. Although this is more of a viewing difference, it can still change ones perspective after they have gotten used to the Zaxxon graphics. There is no more outer space battle. Instead, you must go through a narrow tunnel to get to area 3. Instead of 20 fighters, you now have to tangle with 25 fighters in area 2. A new enemy, the Mine Layer, is introduced. As the name implies, this ship lays mines in your path. You can destroy the mines but it takes a few hits. Instead of encountering one Zaxxon robot, you now have to deal with three Super Zaxxon, dragon looking robots. The placement of things (fuel tanks, gun implacements, etc.) in areas 1 and 3 is different then in Zaxxon. There are now indestructible, elevated guns in area 1. These guns sit on the right side and they are 2.5 units in altitude.</desc>

		<desc>Superbike Challenge brings 1000cc motorbikes to life for a one or two player race. Unusually, the screen is split horizontally, with your action only ever using half of the screen. You can play a full season of races, or run at one of the 12 tracks as a stand-alone race (including Assen, Mugello, the old Hockenheim and Spa). A manual gearbox option and 3 skill levels ensure that you can't master the game immediately. Full information on your speed and revs, the race order and course layout are on screen at all times. Superbike Challenge is an updated version of Grand Prix 500 cc, with a better menu and title screen and some different in-game graphics.</desc>

The game has all the expected elements. Instead of playing as Pac Man the player takes the role of Supercuda the fish, instead of ghosts there is a different selection of deep sea predators on each screen, instead of power pills there are electric eels and so on.

The game is entirely joystick controlled.</desc>

		<desc>The game is for 2 players (or 1 vs the computer) and pits Superman against the character Darkseid. The object of the game is to save citizens of Metropolis (playing as Superman) or lure them to your underground lair (playing as Darkseid). 

The game area is split into six sectors; 3 in the streets of Metropolis and 3 underground. Frantic citizens are running around the city and can be directed by deflectors  or by using super powers . The players cannot leave a sector until they collect a diamond . They then get to choose which sector to move to.

In between each sector is a 'combat zone' mini-game These come in a variety of styles. If the player who chose to leave the sector wins, the game moves on to the chosen sector. If they lose, play returns to the previous sector. In the sectors, the players can fire beams of set lengths (Superman uses heat vision, Darkseid fires an omega ray).</desc>

You were supposed to sleep - in limited cryogenic suspension - for the next 500 years, 20 miles beneath the surface of the planet, while the great Filtering Computers maintained all surface systems. But the computers have taken you out of suspension because something is terribly wrong: the weather has become brutal, food production is dangerously low, and the Transportation System is malfunctioning, causing unprecedented accidents and casualties. The planet is in chaos.

You are physically immobilized. But you have six robots at your disposal, and you must manipulate them strategically to bring the Filtering Computers back into balance. Each robot has a distinct perception of the world and offers you specific abilities - one offers you sight; a second, hearing; a third, access to information in the computer memory banks. Through the robots, you must save the planet from destruction.</desc>

		<desc>In this puzzle board game you should swap the tiles to make the sequence of tiles of the same color to eliminate them.
Shape of tiles varies from big and small squares to triangles or hexagons. If tiles have no neighbor tiles you may take appropriate tiles from the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the rest of the tiles. Finishing the level, player will be transferred to the higher level if the results of the current level were high enough for such level. But to finish level successfully, player should acquire the certain number of points and to be qualified for the next level. The difficulty also raises and depends on quantity of colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit presence. Undo moves are also present, but such moves decrease your final results. Game may be saved in progress and loaded later. 

Best scores and levels will be written in High Score Table.</desc>

		<name>Swiss Family Robinson</name>
		<desc>Swiss Family Robinson is a computer game based on the 1812 novel by Johann David Wyss. Players take the role of Fritz, the eldest brother of a Swiss family that has been shipwrecked in the oceans of the East Indies en route to Port Jackson, Australia. As the game begins, it is your goal to find a way off of the ship, onto the deserted island, and build a shelter to survive. Numerous challenges await Fritz as he has to defend against tropical storms, hostile animals, and the mischievous antics of his youngest brother Francis, which can sometimes hinder the player's progress. Swiss Family Robinson is a classic-style text adventure game, using basic word commands and phrases to talk to your family, take action, or accomplish goals. As with most games of the the time, you have to explore the details of the scenery in order to find clues and items that will aid your survival. There are some "help" features in the game to give a player additional info. such as a "Help" key, a mapping/navigation system, and an actual "Guide to Nature" book that contains detailed information on island flora and fauna, as well as basic survival skills.</desc>

		<name>Sword Of Kadash</name>
		<desc>The game is a top-down action/adventure game set within a maze of rooms and corridors. The player can move in any of the four directions (and diagonally), and fire darts. Only three darts can be fired at a time. These will ricochet off some walls, and be absorbed or cause holes to form in others. They are also the primary method for defeating the various monsters that are scattered about. Monsters can also be defeated by coming into contact with you, but you will in turn take damage. The player has a number of stats. These include health (hit-points) and Armour class, which measures the player's defensive ability and is increased by collecting better armor and rings. There is also experience which is increased by defeating monsters, and will cause the player to level up (increasing hit-points) every so often. The experience levels are equally spaced, with the gap depending on the game difficulty that is selected at the start of the game. The player's dart attack effectiveness is based on the weapon they are carrying, which may be dagger, morning-star, axe and sword, each of which may be enchanted up to +3.</desc>

		<desc>Tapper is an action game where you're a beer tapper (barman) and have to serve beer to demanding customers. There are four customers, each has its own lane lengthier than the previous one, whom you have to keep at bay. If they reach the end of the lane without receiving their beer, you're a goner; if you miss one and accidentally spill beer needlessly you lose a life and should one of them throw you back the mug and you fail to catch it, you lose a life as well.

Occasionally a bizarre icon will appear on one of the lines and, should you grab it, will invoke a "cabarette"-style show which will keep some of the customers occupied.

The Xbox 360 version includes bonus rounds, as well as co-op and versus multiplayer modes, also online, along with achievements.</desc>

		<name>TechnoCop</name>
		<desc>Techno Cop is set in the near future. You are a cop who seeks to clear his town of all the criminal scum. The game consists of two parts; one driving-action and one sidescrolling-action. In the first part you drive around in your red Ferrari and destroy hostile cars; in the second part, you turn somersaults over gaps, use elevators and shoot lots of enemies until you reach the boss. After having killed / caught the villain, it's back to the road again for the next mission.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles</name>
		<desc>With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</desc>

		<name>Terra Cresta</name>
		<desc>Terra Cresta is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up. The player controls a ship, initially with limited firepower. Numbered pods appear containing further parts of the ship that will increase firepower. These additional parts combine with the player's ship to increase its firepower, and the final module transforms it into a fiery phoenix which is invulnerable for a certain period of time. Once the ship has multiple sections, the player may also split it, allowing it to fire in multiple directions. The player begins with three lives and it is possible to play with either one or two players. Home conversions of the game appeared on the NES, Commodore 64, and the ZX Spectrum. Dempa also released a port of both Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta for the X68000. An emulated version of the game was released in 2005 for PlayStation 2 in Japan as part of the Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono-series. Three sequels of this game were released: Terra Force (Nichibutsu, 1987), Terra Cresta II (Nichibutsu, 1992) for PC Engine and Terra Cresta 3D (Nichibutsu, 1997) for Sega Saturn.</desc>

		<name>Terramex</name>
		<desc>This multi-level action/adventure takes players back 40 years to find Professor K.K. Renegade, who predicts that a catastrophic asteroid is heading straight for earth. You're in charge of finding Professor Renegade. Select one of the five most intrepid Adventurers from England, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. to spearhead the search. Professor Renegade was last seen in the unexplored region of the highest Tibetan ranges; an area populated by creatures and conditions of the professor's own design: venomous stone snakes, reptilian birds, and acid storms. Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle. Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth. You must now search for high-tech tools such as an atomic pile, a 9-volt battery, and a bent coat hanger! Use the joystick and the appropriate keys to maneuver the Adventurer across the landscape. You have 30 days to complete the mission. During the mission, the Adventurer collects various items (points are awarded for each). Some items serve little purpose; others are vital; and others only work in certain places. Only one item can be held at a time and it must be held to be used. Native bearers carry the items collected. To look at what each bearer has, type 1 or 2 to scroll through the bearers. The Adventurer can exchange the item held (press S) with a bearer that is closest to him. Its trial and error time. Good luck. The game comes with cheats and a map for those that require a little help.</desc>

		<desc>Thai Boxing is a one on one fighting game shown from an isometric perspective. Different joystick combinations let your fighter perform high, middle or low attacking moves as well as dodge or block his opponent's attacks. Fighters receive scores for successful attacks. The more difficult or effective the attack, the higher the score. Unless one fighter is knocked out, the fighter who has the highest score at the end of three rounds wins.

Although the game is shown from an isometric perspective, it is not possible to move in three dimensions.</desc>

		<desc>Threshold is a simple shoot'em up game. You are in control of a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and have to shoot several formations of enemies at the top of the screen.

To make things more difficult you have limited time in form of a fuel tank which will get refilled after you cleared a number of waves. Besides that, your spacecraft is equipped with a laser that tends to overheat. Every shot makes the heat bar of the laser increase a bit. Once it reached its maximum you can't fire anymore and are forced to wait until it cools down while slowly running out of fuel.</desc>

		<name>Thud Ridge - American Aces in 'Nam</name>
		<desc>The game plot is set in times of Vietnam War, where you are American pilot of the Republic F-105 Thunderchief affectionately known as the "Thud", a conventional strike and "defense suppression" aircraft. North Vietnam was divided up by the US military into a set of target zones referred to for some reason as "Route Packages (RPs)". The most heavily defended area was "RP-6A", in and around Hanoi. To enter into this target area, the F-105s had to fly over a region of hilly ground that became known as "Thud Ridge".

You are starting your career in "Wild Weasels" as Lieutenant, description of your first mission is to get the feel of your "Thud", but it is just a start of perilous and glorious ladder. The next missions vary from eliminating the Doumer tankers or bombing the bridge to dropping the leaflets or engaging the MiGs. Your rank may be raised if mission will be accomplished.

In the very beginning of each mission you should read the mission description, accept of decline this mission, and equip your aircraft with weapons and supplies. Taking off the airbase either from Korat or another place, you should flight to your destination eliminating the opponent MiGs, run the "Ridge", and complete your mission. The gameplay flows in third-person view with common flight simulator abilities.</desc>

Although you start with only a sword, more can be collected by attacking the various containers through the levels - later weapons can destroy these enemies quicker, and allow attacks from a distance. Reaching the end of each level sees bonuses for time and kills. The path through the game can be varied on later levels, so you can play it through more than once and find new sections, even though the individual levels only scroll left-to-right.</desc>

Next are rescue and combat missions, which test your perception, precision, and reflexes. For further challenges, there are finally sea rescue and armed escort missions. Each mode has three levels of difficulty. You have a limited selection of guns and missiles for combat, and an onboard computer guides you through missions.

If you get bored with the game scenery, you can load scenery disks from subLOGIC's Flight Simulator series.</desc>

		<desc>In Time Machine, the player takes control over Professor Potts whose main profession is building time machines. As terrorists bomb his laboratory, he gets sucked ten million years into the past. During the course of his adventure he will visit five time zones with five screens each.

This is an adventure with action elements. Most of the game is spent manipulating objects in the different time zones which have an effect on a later zone, e.g. planting a seed in the stone age will cause a tree to appear in the later zones. He also may need to bring an object from one time to another. In each zone there is one big puzzle to solve in order to get access to the next zone (the ultimate goal is to prevent the time machine from getting destroyed), but constant traveling between the time zones is necessary.</desc>

Hitting bumpers and other obstacles rewards points and completing a table requires mastering certain objectives which depend on the table on hand. Every table is divided into twp parts with their own paddles: the game only scrolls if the ball goes down. The four tables are: Volcano: The winning condition is to spell the table's name by using the associated volcano lanes. Ruins: In the middle of the table there is a "collect ball" hole. If all targets were hit and two balls were collected in the hole, a special fire ball is set loose. The stage is won when bringing this ball into the hole. Saqqarah: This pyramid themed table also required spelling a name by knocking down targets and hitting a special hole. The last table introduces Breakout elements: the player needs to hit blocks to vaporize them.</desc>

		<name>Time Tunnel</name>
		<desc>You are a Gnome and your ambition in life is to be King of the Gnomes and the opportunity has arisen for you. There is a document explaining how to be King but the problem is it is in seven pieces and the pieces are lost. The bigger problem is that each piece is in a different time zone which are 9600 BC, 893 BC, 86 BC, 1692, 1849, 3456 and 9999. Luckily in your house you have a Time Machine but a part is missing so you need to search your house for it before you can travel and search Time.

In each time zone, puzzles need solving by picking up objects and placing them in the correct locations which even means travelling with them through time and placing them in the correct location in the correct time period. To slow you down you can only carry one piece at a time but you can store in your magic closet eight items for storage which can be entered anywhere by holding down the fire button for a few seconds.. You also have the ability to fire lasers as well.

Time Tunnel is a flick-screen arcade adventure with each room or a part of each location shown on the screen at an elevated angle. The joystick is used to control your Gnome and to interact with objects and the locations. The fire button fires your lasers.</desc>

		<desc>A simple action-RPG following the adventures of a young warrior (strong barbarian, armored knight, or quick valkyrie) to assist a weakened kingdom from various threats, and to recover special Artifacts that once made the kingdom strong.

Gameplay consists of moving your character in real-time through various terrains, like forests, towns, and dungeons. The player gathers basic items, like health and magic potions, and increasingly powerful weapons as you progress through the story. Conversations are handled through keyphrases. Combat is real-time as well, against a few types of creatures (skeletons, orcs, rogues) of which there can be various flavors.</desc>

		<name>Tobruk : The Clash of Armour</name>
		<desc>The battle for Tobruk in May-July 1942 was one of the key battles of the North African front in World War 2. Rommel lead the Axis forces to a victory, taking out Allied forces which were gathered to densely mine a strategic defensive area of Libya. In this tactical wargame, players can do the same. Taking the six Allied supply points is crucial to your mission's success.

You must guide the movement and attacks of your units. You can also call in aircraft and engineer support. The game is turn-based; once you have given your orders, the Allies do the same. Unit damage is progressively calculated. Unlike the Allies, you use mobile suppliers, which you also command. They should be kept in range of your units (with no Allied forces in between).

The game includes optional action sequences, which can be practised outside the main game. You control navigation, driving and gunning (with turrets and machine guns) for individual units, from a first-person view.</desc>

		<desc>Tom &amp; Jerry is a platformer based on the two cartoon animals. The player takes the role of Jerry who has to navigate the five levels while collecting every piece of cheese. Besides the usual platforming obstacles there is a time limit and Tom who tries to catch Jerry. The player needs to avoid Tom but can also use the environment to get rid of him temporarily: a bowling ball on the head knocks him out or a prepared floor lets him slip. The main levels are side-scrolling, but between each level the game switches to a behind-the-shoulder perspective. Then Jerry has to run through a tunnel while collecting cheese and avoiding dynamite or bombs.</desc>

		<name>Tomahawk</name>
		<desc>Flight simulation specialists Digital Integration turned their attention to helicopter flight in this recreation of the AH-64 Apache. All the controls are realistically simulated, so the airspeed is dependent on the height of the vehicle, and you can move horizontally using the rudder option as well as rolling left and right. If using a Sinclair joystick interface you can use both ports to have all these controls accessible on dual joysticks, just like the real thing. Either way, a full instrument panel allows monitoring of these.

You are armed with cannons, rockets and anti-tank missiles, each of which has its target set up independently, but only one can be loaded at once. Flight options include day/night, clear/cloudy and air turbulence on/off, allowing beginners and experts to find a suitable setting. Scenery includes trees, mountains and pylons, while enemy targets include helicopters, turrets and tanks.</desc>

The simulation here is of a full season of major league baseball. You can view statistics for every team, and play with one or two players, or manage teams while the computer plays through the season for you. Players have injury records and performance streaks.

The game could be enhanced with several add-on disks, sold separately: Great Teams 1901-1968, A.L. Stadiums, N.L. Stadiums, Classic Stadiums, and Fantasy Manager, which let you draft players into new teams and leagues.</desc>

		<name>Top Gun</name>
		<desc>The Tom Cruise film featured an F-14 Tomcat plane, and this licensed game recreates this. Viewed from the cockpit in full 3D, the game is a straight head-to-head duel, against another player or the computer. You are armed with missiles (while put you in control of a small target zone, which must reman over your opponent for 3 seconds), flares and cannons (which overheat when overused)- use these more wisely than your opponent. Pay attention to speed and altitude too. The computer has 3 planes to throw at you, of which the last is the toughest, while each player in a 2-player game also has 3 'lives'.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Total Recall puts you in charge of Douglas Quaid, who must find a way to Mars in order to find the answers to his two questions: why is he being hunted, and who is hunting him. In order to do this, Quaid must go through level after level of beating up bad guys that get in his way.

Some of the levels differ in gameplay, and range between action and driving scenes. The action scenes mainly require you to collect some items before leaving the level. You have only one chance to complete the current level, which means that if your energy is lost, the game ends. Energy is lost if you are attacked by an obstacle, or if you are shot at by an enemy. You can gain more energy by either collecting some pills or a heart, depending on the platform.</desc>

		<desc>Tournament Tennis is an early tennis game featuring or even creating many conventions that would become standard features in later tennis simulations. Matches can be played at quarter-final, semi-final or final level?winning at one level automatically moves the player to the next one. They can last for 3 or 5 sets, with a player requiring a 2-game lead to win a set, though a tie-break comes in at 6?6 in all but the final set.

The view is pseudo-3D, from above the court, and features a shadow on the ball to give its motion a more realistic appearance and make it easier to judge the ball's height. Spectators turn their heads to view the action, and ball boys run on to the court to retrieve dead balls. Shot speed, direction and spin can all be applied, and both forehand and backhand strokes are available.</desc>

		<desc>Track &amp; Field is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. Events include the 100 meter dash, the hammer throw, the javelin throw, the long jump, the high jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

You can jump these holes by pressing fire, although you have a limited number of these for each level, and adjust the speed by pulling the joystick forward or backwards.  You face a time limit on each of the 21 levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one. A simultaneous 2-player mode is included, similar to the split-screen mode in the Lotus games (by the same authors).</desc>

		<name>Trains</name>
		<desc>Trains is a top-down managerial game. In the age of steam-powered trains, there are opportunities to make money on great railroads. It will be up to the player to take control of a train on a railroad and turn a profit. The player does this by moving the train to a loading station that will supply raw material, and stopping in front of it with the appropriate car and blowing the whistle to begin the loading process. This is then delivered to the stations of industries that need them, unloading taking place the exact same way. The faster goods are delivered, the more money is made, with extra profits available when an industry is in critical need of a supply. Meters of available industry supplies can be shown on the screen. The train itself can only be stopped and move forwards and backwards, following the path of the train track, left and right movement is used only at switches, where the track splits into two directions. Each action of train movement uses coal, multiplied by the weight of the goods being carried. Coal is resupplied at the coal yard, and is loaded into the coal car the same way as other goods, spending money in order to buy coal. If the player runs out of coal while driving the train, it will cost them twice as much to have the coal delivered to the train. Every 3 minutes, $200 is deducted from the player for payroll and any crashed train costs another $200 in penalties. Each level is a unique track design, and can take place across cities, deserts, mountains and plains. As industry supplies are managed, a track is gradually built at the edge of the screen which will lead to the next level.</desc>

		<name>Triango</name>
		<desc>TrianGO is a variation of the board game Go that is played on a hexagon shaped board. The board is composed of 21 lines which cross to form triangles. The lines intersect to create 55 points where players can place their stones. The game is available for up to four players who take turns placing stones on the board. The aim is to capture the stones of the opponents by creating triangles. A triangle is created when three stones are positioned so that they can be connected with straight lines. All of the stones that are located within the triangle can then be captured if the player chooses to. When making a capture, both the player's own stones and those of the opponents are removed from the board. The player's own stones can be brought back into play while the opponents' are permanently out. To win the game the player has to become the last one still able to make a move (due to still having stones left).</desc>

		<name>Trivial Pursuit</name>
		<desc>This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. 

One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</desc>

You can lose one of your four lives by touching a creature, falling from a height or touching certain obstacles. Another problem you have is that you can only carry five items at a time, once you have five you must go back to the start to pay for them and store them. Switches also need to be find to make certain walls that are blocking your path disappear.

		<desc>Turbo 64 is a racing game which allows you and eight other friends to each race over a set number of laps each to get the highest score. There are two tracks to choose from, Loonies loop or Devils Deathtrack. Before the players drive you can select which gear shift to use (regular or auto) and how many laps (1-9). Each player now takes it in turns to drive round the track and complete the chosen number of laps. Your score gets higher the longer and faster you drive but straying too far off the track or hitting an obstacle on the side stops the car and stops your score from getting higher. The winner of the race is the player with the highest score.</desc>

A classic "Drive &amp; Shoot" game with stylish presentation unmatched on the C64, you control a red sports car speeding down narrow roads, shooting every car in sight while trying to avoid enemy gunfire and various obstacles as you drive through exotic locations like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Thailand, South Africa and more.

In early stages there is little hostile activity, but in later stages almost all vehicles will shoot you on sight. You'll have to deal with cars, vans, trucks as well as helicopters and jets! Obstacles on the road, including traffic cones, mines and even rather large rocks will test your reflexes. You must collect fuel on the road to keep your car going. Finally, there are intersections where one route will lead to a dead end, causing your car to crash.</desc>

		<name>Turrican II - The Final Fight</name>
		<desc>Turrican II: The Final Fight is a platformer/shooter as typically seen on consoles, but designed for home computers from the ground up.

An evil mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who's the boss.

Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker.</desc>

		<desc>After the Cariken family became complacent, the land of Gaspar ceased to be ruled as well. This left the way clear for evil men such as Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. Only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces. As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.

		<desc>In this arcade shoot'em up your mission is to infiltrate the alien fortress during eight levels, and to destroy the fortress and the alien.

Sitting in Ajax H.Q., you must pilot the remote controlled drone ship to do this. The drone represents jet fighter (behind view) and helicopter gunship (top-down view). It may be moved on the screen, fire air-to-air and air-to-ground guns and pow bomb. Limitless hordes of mechanoid invaders, whose sole intent is the total domination of the Earth, will try to stop you. Exit from each level is guarded by the powerful boss, who you should eliminate.

There are two versions of the arcade version (Typhoon in Europe and Ajax in Japan) which only differ in the order of the eight stages. The DOS and Sharp versions are based on Ajax while the Commodore 64, CPC (five levels) and ZX Spectrum (six levels) versions are based on Typhoon. The PlayStation 4 version includes both arcade versions.</desc>

After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named "Exodus" before their death.

		<name>Ultima IV : Quest of the Avatar</name>
		<desc>Ultima IV - Quest of the Avatar is the fourth entry in the Ultima series.

Ultima IV is among the few role-playing games, and perhaps the first, in which the game's story does not center on asking a player to overcome a tangible ultimate evil. Unlike most RPGs the game is not set in an "age of darkness"; prosperous Britannia resembles Renaissance Italy, or King Arthur's Camelot. The object of the game is to focus on the main character's development in virtuous life — possible because the land is at peace — and become a spiritual leader and an example to the people of the world of Britannia.

The game follows the protagonist's struggle to understand and exercise the Eight Virtues; Honesty, Compassion, Valour, Justice, Sacrifice, Honour, Spirituality and Humility. After proving his or her understanding in each of the Virtues, locating several artefacts and finally descending into the dungeon called the Stygian Abyss to gain access to the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom, the protagonist becomes an Avatar.</desc>

		<desc>The Avatar, the embodiment of the Eight Virtues and the hero of Britannia, is called back to deal with a grave threat. Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne.

		<name>Ultima VI - The False Prophet</name>
		<desc>Several years after having restored Lord British to his rightful position as the monarch of Britannia, the Avatar is captured by demon-like creatures and placed on a sacrificial altar. His friends Iolo, Shamino and Dupre appear just in time to save him. In the Britannia castle, the Avatar learns that his abductors were gargoyles, a race of enigmatic creatures who have recently invaded Britannia and occupied the shrines of Virtue. As the Avatar embarks on a quest to liberate Britannia, he begins to gain insight into the gargoyles' true motives, and realizes that it is his duty to achieve peace and understanding between the two races.

Ultima VI is notable for having a fully continuous world. There is no "world map" in the game; all the locations are seamlessly connected to each other, turning the game world into an open environment. Compared to the previous installments in the series, the game focuses more on quests and exploration rather than on combat. The latter no longer involves separate screens; battles occur during exploration, without any transitions. The turn-based system from the previous games has been preserved.</desc>

While driving on a lonely road at night, a strange figure blocks your vision causing you to swerve and crash your car.

The only place he could have gone is a creepy old mansion which looms in front of you. With nowhere else to go, you enter the mansion in search of your brother. It turns out the mansion once belonged to an old wizard and his apprentice, and somehow it has become infested with the Undead.</desc>

If you land on another car, you destroy it and collect points. You can also collect things like balloons and ice cream cones for bonus points. The faster you collect all the flags, the bigger a time bonus you get.

In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you will need to jump on it. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. Two player games are alternating with the players taking their turns.</desc>

Additionally, all the planets of the universe are obsessed with an poker-like card game. So the player visits planets, barters cards and plays the card game - and if a planet is satisfied with their own set, they reward the player with cats. 

Every time the player visits another planet he has to solve a straight action sequence which utilizes vector graphics for 3D glasses. Here he simply has to fly around in first person and shoot all enemy ships. Other action sequences take place in black holes.</desc>

		<desc>War in Middle Earth on 8-bit machines is a simpler version of the 16-bit game. It doesn't feature the questing and RPG aspects of the other title and is instead a pure strategy game. The player controls the forces of good in the War of the Ring from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The game begins with the Fellowship of the Ring just having formed in Rivendell and the hobbit Frodo Baggins carrying the One Ring. The ultimate goal of the game is to get the ring bearer to the cracks of Mount Doom to destroy the ring. The game is lost if the ring bearer is killed or corrupted by the ring's influence or if Sauron's forces capture the city of Minas Tirith. War in Middle Earth is a real-time strategy game released for the ZX Spectrum, MSX, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, MS-DOS, Commodore Amiga, Apple IIGS, and Atari ST in 1988 by Australian company Melbourne House.</desc>

		<desc>Warp! is an arcade racing game where the player, whose country's research center has just been raided by aliens, needs to rescue kidnapped scientists and recover stolen computers, weapons and microfilms. To pick up a scientist or an item the player has to stop and leave the car and move by foot to the item without getting killed by an alien. In the same way it's necessary to pick up fuel canisters to avoid running out of gas. Hitting any object or alien leads to a life being lost. In addition to fuel it is also necessary to collect energy vapor. As the energy is filled the vehicle is upgraded, first to a turbo racer and then to a jet fighter and finally to a combat tank. With the jet fighter it is possible to fire back at the aliens while the tank can run over road hazards.</desc>

		<name>Warrior Of Ras Vol. 2 - Kaiv</name>
		<desc>This is the sequel to the first part of the Warriors of Ras series, Dunzhin. All games in this series are early graphical Roguelikes. The story is quite simple: Enter the mystical monster-infested dungeon Kaiv, slay monsters and grab treasures. 

You explore the dungeon in a turn-based manner by entering commands in text adventure, like "MOVE NORTH" or "LIGHT TORCH". The commands may be abbreviated by one or two letters. You can also move several squares at once (like "MOVE EAST 3") to speed up your quest. Another very helpful command is "SPEED", which makes the game's messages go by faster. Your progress is hindered by traps (acid pools, slimey floors etc., some of which you can escape by quickly pressing a key), thieves who rob you, random teleports and, of course, by a variety of 24 different monsters, ranging from simple Zombies, Wolves or Dwarves up to Wyverns and Vampires.

The combat system makes the Warriors of Ras series stand out from other roguelikes: Apart from your total hit points, you and the monsters also have hit points and armor for each body party separately. If the hit points of one body part reach zero, you're dead. Each attack must be directed to one of the body parts, some of which are easier to hit than others. You may also "AIM" a hit (which costs some time, but makes the attack more likely to hit) or "FORCE" an attack (this makes it more difficult to hit, but increases the damage). This and the body parts result in a quite tactical combat -- you have to guess or find out the weak parts of your opponent and choose the right way of attacking.

Kaiv extends the originally quite simple game of Dunzhin by adding a shop at the dungeon entrance where you can equip yourself. You now also have a bigger variety of items like torches, crosses (against Vampires) and mirrors (against Gorgons), and you can also find magical items: several rings, wands or potions that improve your magical or physical protection or increase you fighting skills. You also need to take enough food and drink with you to prevent dying from hunger or thirst.

The difficulty level of the game is quite high with new characters -- you often die just by being hit once by a low-level monster or by stepping into some trap. The game is generous in allowing you to save your progress at any time.</desc>

		<name>Way Out</name>
		<desc>Wayout is an early use of first-person 3D perspective, featuring a small gameplay window but smooth 360-degree movement. You are trapped inside one of 26 mazes (composed of 90-degree direction changes) and must find the exit. The game records how many movement units you use up, and saves the best scores to disk. Up to nine in-progress games can also be saved.

You have a compass and a map-making kit, enabling the game to automatically map the areas you explore. These can be stolen by the Cleptangle beast, but you can chase him to get them back. 

You can't push against the wind without finding a special way of overcoming it. Fireflies automatically move with the wind, and can serve as a clue to its direction.</desc>

		<desc>The story began years ago on the campus of a large university. You were a first-year student who spent more time learning how to sufi dance with a local whirling dirvish than studying. Your brother, while always a bit more clumsy and scatter-brained than you, somehow managed to graduate with a doctorate and was immediately offered a research position in the archeology department.

Trouble began when your brother returned from a year-long research expedition in the rain forests of South America. Not only did he return without any of the tools he'd borrowed from the university, but he had no notes documenting how he had spent his year. Out of concern for your brother's future and intrigued by his repeated mumbling about priceless ancient artifacts, you decide to retrace his steps.</desc>

		<desc>In Wicked, a big evil has come to the world and the player has to drive it back. To do so, the twelve astrological signs (with three levels each) have to be purged. The basic idea is that portals spit out spores which can be either good or evil. The goal is to produce enough good spores to overrun and destroy all evil portals before the screen is filled with bad spores.</desc>

		<name>Winter Camp</name>
		<desc>Winter Camp is the sequel to Summer Camp. Maximus Mouse is now a rescue ranger at Camp Nice'n'Icy, but he soon notices a bird who will knock a pebble down a mountain, setting off a avalanche that will engulf the camp, unless he can prevent it, over eight varied levels.

The levels offer various challenges. The most common type of level is a patrol. There are three such levels, involving ice skating, boating on a river, and skiing. On each level you have a quota of rescues to make. There are various obstacles on the levels, and a variety of objects to use to avoid them. For example, a spring will allow you to jump over a stretch of water.

At the end of each of these levels is a boss, who must be defeated using the objects you have collected. The bosses are easier to defeat the more rescues you perform.

Other levels include a skate training level, a snowball fight with bears hiding in trees, and a memory game with a cameo appearance by Clyde Radcliffe from the Creatures series. Most of the levels have a time limit, indicated by the bird moving towards the pebble.</desc>

		<desc>This is a winter sports game that lets you compete in five Olympic events: Downhill skiing, Biathlon, Slalom, Ski Jump and Bob Sled. It is very similar to offerings like Winter Games from Epyx.

In Downhill skiing, you must avoid the obstacles and make it to the bottom of the hill, by swerving left and right and adjusting your speed by pushing the joystick forward and back. The Slalom is similar, involving skiing around flags.

In the ski jump, you must position the skis for a proper landing. In the bobsled event, you must carefully control the angles so your bobsled doesn't flip. The Biathlon event combines skiing to shooting ranges and shooting the targets archery-style.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, the player controls a postal clerk in the small fishing village of Festeron. The postmaster, Mr. Crisp, orders the player to deliver an envelope to the owner of Ye Olde Magick Shoppe. However, this seemingly innocent task inexplicably leads to a strange phenomenon: as the hero steps out, he finds that Festeron has been mysteriously transformed into a dark, ominous town called Witchville. Even cute little poodles have turned into hellhounds! Finding the Wishbringer, a stone that grants seven wishes to those who possess the right objects, seems like the only solution - or is it?</desc>

		<name>Wizardry : Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</name>
		<desc>The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process. The first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. The player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure</desc>

		<name>Wizardry II : The Knight of Diamonds</name>
		<desc>Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds is the sequel to Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. It is an early example of an expansion pack, requiring the player to have the original Wizardry installed to play. It uses the same engine and spells, but is scaled for importing existing characters rather than creating a new party. Players explore a 3D wire frame maze searching for a key item, the Staff of Gnilda, required to complete the game. The player creates a party of up to 6 characters of various classes, and then gain experience points by fighting random encounters. The maze has many hidden doors and secrets, so the player is encouraged to map out each floor on graph paper to find their way.</desc>

		<name>Wizardry III : Legacy of Llylgamyn</name>
		<desc>A generation has passed since your band of adventurers reclaimed the Staff of Gnilda and the armor of the Knight of Diamonds, and the land has been at peace. But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb. Legacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game. Character classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.</desc>

		<desc>Just when things were going great with Tom-Tom and his girlfriend Tanya, some thug of a woodland king had to kidnap her and hide her away, and Tom-Tom doesn't have a clue where. That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.</desc>

		<name>World Championship Soccer</name>
		<desc>This soccer game lets you choose a team representing one of twenty-four countries around the world to participate in the World Championship tournament, which is identical to the real 1990 World Cup.

Once you pick your team you can also select which players you want on the field, so that you can round out the team's strengths and weaknesses. Also provided are modes for single exhibition matches, either against the computer or against a friend.

The action is viewed from above with large player sprites. Violent play is encouraged as there are no free kicks. The gameplay is rather simple: you can only control the player closest to the ball, and many soccer rules (such as penalty flags and offsides) are missing.</desc>

A course editor is provided.  The courses provided include real courses like St. Andrews, a fictional designs such as The Gauntlet, which as the name suggests is designed to push your skills to the maximum.

The PC version revolutionized the use of the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via their patented "RealSound" process. Quips like "No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap", "Straight onto the fairway", and "Looks like he hit the tree, Jim." are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.</desc>

When you select a club, its range is superimposed on the view, making planning shots easier. Wind, pin placement and even weather conditions must be considered as you play your shot.

This is the game that gives you what you need to experience real football strategy. And action? Once the ball is snapped you're the key player. Just grab the joystick and pit your brains against brawn. Run a sweep, make a tackle, throw a bomb--even kick a field goal. Plus you have three views of the game play action: Open Field Action, "Blimp View" of the entire field and a special One-on-One window. Any way you slice it--this football game has it all: Play calling, play design and on-the-field action. Try it. You'll find out why we call it The World's Greatest Football Game! - Real Football Strategy Plus Real Football Action - Call Your Own Plays from the Sidelines - Joystick Action--Break Tackles, Intercept Passes, Throw a Bomb - Design Your Own Offensive and Defensive Plays--Or Use the Playbook - One or Two Players</desc>

		<name>WWF Wrestlemania Challenge</name>
		<desc>At the height of the World Wrestling Federation's European fame came this crunching recreation of the elaborate hammed-up action. Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior or the British Bulldog can come under your control.

You play either in practice matches (against the hopefully-misnamed Mr Perfect) or in a sequence of 5 matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. Your opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, your opponents will deliver a taunt, which you must respond to as creatively as possible.

The game is a beat 'em up viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. Your aim is to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin.

Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you win the grapple.</desc>

		<name>X-Men - Madness in Murderworld</name>
		<desc>Marvel's X-Men comic-book characters feature in this mission in the Murderworld amusement arcade. The story is told in an exclusive bundled comic - Magneto and Arcade have kidnapped Professor X, and the loyal X-Men must rescue him.

If the X-Men are to save the day, the player must combine action and adventuring skills. A device to stop Magneto exists, but the pieces must be found. In total there are over 500 scenes of combat and action.

You can switch between the X-Men at any time, with their special abilities ranging from Wolverine's claws to the Nightcrawler's teleporting incorporated into their moves. Other X-Men regulars feature in the game, complete with their special abilities.</desc>

		<name>Xenophobe</name>
		<desc>Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart.  A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>

Xevious is a vertically scrolling shooter based on the 1982 coin-op of the same name. It was innovative in that it was the first vertically scrolling shooter to feature dual-level attacks; both ground and air.</desc>

		<desc>Yogi Bear has woken from his hibernation and is now searching his home, Jellystone Park for Picnic Baskets brought by tourists. On one search, Yogi over hears an awful telephone conversation with Ranger Smith that the Park is closing and all animals must be caught and transferred to a zoo. Not wanting to live in a cage or enclosure, Yogi has decided to escape and thus the beginning of his adventure. You have to guide Yogi over six levels (ending in New York) keeping ahead of a tracker and his dog. You must complete each level in 2 minutes 40 seconds or it is game over. On the way there are obstacles like holes and water, as well as other characters to get in your way. Touching these loses one of three lives. Scattered over the levels are various food items which will give you 100 points as well as invisible ones giving 250 points. If you want a bigger score then on certain levels you can collect six items which reward you with 7500 points.</desc>

		<name>Zamzara</name>
		<desc>You play as the alien Zamzara captured and forced to escape from a twisted laboratory complex. A bomb is set to go off and you have to search for and leave in your ship before the time runs out. After 15 minutes it's game over. Along the way you come face to face (some of the enemies are literally faces shooting projectiles at you) with enemies both big and small. Defeat them with your arsenal of weapons which include explosive special abilities that spread out to each side - very efficient against heaps of smaller enemies.

Being a budget title and coming in relatively late in the C64 life cycle, it is known for its smoothly scrolling visuals and amazing soundtrack by Charles Deenen of Maniacs of Noise. It was also infamous for having a high difficulty, even for its time.</desc>

		<desc>Zenji is an action/strategy game where you control a rolling face throughout a maze. Each section of the maze can be rotated by the face. The goal is to turn the entire maze green by connecting each section of the maze to the source at the center of the screen. After all sections of the maze have been connected, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to having a time limit to complete your task, you need to avoid the flames and sparks which wander about the maze. From time to time a number will appear in a maze section and count down from 9 to 0. If you touch the number before it disappears, bonus points are earned. As the levels progress, the mazes become larger, trickier and more flames will appear.</desc>

		<desc>After escaping the Timelords you begin a fight for survival on the cave world of Zarkifir. This is where the Timelords have established their base from which they intend to dominate this planetary system. You must navigate the caves and undermine their forces! In this game the player controls a zeppelin traveling through a cave system. The goal is to survive the cave defenses, acquire a TNT bomb, and unlock access to the chamber where the bomb can be detonated. The zeppelin is capable of firing in all directions. The player has limited ability to control the advancement through the caves, as the screen constantly scrolls with directions shifting according to the cave layout. The caves have many defenses, from laser walls to falling rocks. Most of these can be disabled by shooting switches on the cave walls. In order to access the room where the bomb can be detonated, the player has to find a hamburger and use it to bribe the hamburger creature that blocks the entrance. The two-player mode has one player controlling the zeppelin movement, while the second player controls the guns.</desc>

The setting is Los Angeles which is made up of five side view screens which the player flies between. The blimp is moved around with joystick but the manoeuvrability is limited by its size as well as the gravity. There is no reverse so it needs to be turned around to change direction.

In total there are 48 people waiting to be rescued and they all need to be brought to the home base where a space ship is being built. It's important to pay attention to the fuel gauge and refuel before it gets too low. There are also obstacles such as clouds, bridges and buildings that have to be avoided since any crash will lead to all passengers getting killed and the player losing a life.</desc>

Each level also contains some warp holes; enter one of these and you will be transported to a new location, which could be useful if you get in trouble. You will also occasionally come across some sonic sparklers; touch one of these, and you will temporarily become invincible. Another oddity you may come across is a super portal, which will transport you to the inner sanctum where bonus dots can be found.</desc>

But what initially appears to be a dungeon is actually one of several entrances to a vast subterranean land?the Great Underground Empire. The player soon encounters dangerous creatures, including deadly grues, an axe-wielding troll, a giant cyclops and a nimble-fingered thief. The ultimate goal of Zork I is to collect the Twenty Treasures of Zork and install them in the trophy case. Finding the treasures requires solving a variety of puzzles such as the navigation of two brutal mazes and some intricate manipulations at Flood Control Dam #3.</desc>

		<name>Zork II - The Wizard of Frobozz</name>
		<desc>The AFGNCAAP begins in the Barrow from Zork I armed only with the trusty brass lantern and sword of elvish antiquity. The purpose of the game is not initially clear. The Wizard of Frobozz is soon introduced. The wizard was once a respected enchanter, but when his powers began to fade he was exiled by Dimwit Flathead. Now bordering on senility, the wizard is still a force to be reckoned with. Your goal, as you venture into the wizard's realm, is to avoid his capricious tricks and learn to control his magic. Like its predecessor, Zork II is essentially a treasure hunt. Unlike the previous game, the ten treasures are tied together by a crude plot. Finding the treasures does not end the game, nor are all the treasures needed to finish the game. Instead, the adventurer must figure out a way to use the treasures in order to reach the game's finale.</desc>

This computer version of Zorro is a strange beast, he can leap across buildings, fall 50 feet and land like a feather, with neither a scratch to his head or a crease in his cape. He can also perform masterful tricks, such as balancing a large plant pot on his head, while simultaneously climbing up a ladder.

Zorro has similar platform gameplay to the same company's Bruce Lee game, but with a slower pace and more puzzle elements. There are 20 different screens in the game, with The Ole Hotel screen being used continually throughout the game. The player must overcome various puzzles, including the branding of a bull and catapulting into the air via a conveniently left spring board and a dazed Garcia guard!</desc>

		<desc>Zyron is a top-down vertically-scrolling shooter set on four alien planets and it incorporates some pseudo 3D elements. The player can steer the ship left and right, and he can also control the forward speed, even bringing everything to a halt. There are enemies on the ground, such as tanks and turrets, and planes in the air. There are also hazards such as electrical currents that need to be avoided. To leave the planet the KEY icons on the right side of the screen need to be gathered to form a sequence. This is done by landing in bunkers marked with an I, which contains information about the planet. At the end of the stage four bunkers are shown and the player needs to choose the one that matches the key sequence to exit. Along the way there are also regular bunkers that repair the ship. Not every enemy hit is lethal, it fills up a damage bar on the right side of the screen. The player starts with three lives. The game can be played with up to eight players, taking turns.</desc>
