		<desc>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

		<desc>Aliens: Alien 2 is an arcade platformer (or run'n'gun if you like) featuring Ripley on a planet infested with aliens. Armed with only a basic gun at first, she faces facehuggers that come out of alien eggs. After having dispatched a face hugger, the egg may be shot to reveal an item. Items may be hand grenades, stronger guns or wing items which make her jump longer. For some reason, the planet is infested not only with aliens and their offspring, but also with snakes. After clearing the surface level, Ripley enters a complex where the first boss, a giant, full-grown alien resides. The following level takes place within the complex.</desc>

The Altered Beast title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in single player mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<desc>You are Rockford, and you have to dig through monster infested caves in search of diamonds. In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.

There are 16 levels to be completed and five different skill levels available, which affect the number of jewels which must be collected and the time limit.</desc>

		<name>Chack'n Pop</name>
		<desc>Chack'n Pop is considered  a predecessor of  Bubble Bobble. It is a platform game where a roundish yellow creature, named Chack'n, must fight against Monstas and Mightas in order to reclaim hearts that were stolen during a romantic encounter with Miss Chack'n.

The Monstas themselves hatch from eggs hanging from the ceilings and the Mightas push a rock that is used as the game's timer. The Monsta eggs have three phases:  if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an egg turns red it will pop almost immediately.

Chack'n uses bombs to blow up the Monstas and their eggs and he also uses them to release the captured hearts from their cages. When the heart is released, it will fly up and destroy the separator block and reveal the exit to the level.

Most versions of the game contain 14 levels to play through, however the Famicom version only includes 9.</desc>

During your attempt to build cars you are pursued by hostile cars and tanks. When the first car is assembled entirely it then will change into a coin.

		<name>Chuckie Egg</name>
		<desc>In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while avoiding the ducklings.  The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong.  Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing.  The ducklings also eat the corn, however.

There are only 8 distinct levels.  The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on.  However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders.  On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.</desc>

		<desc>In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while avoiding the ducklings.  The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong.  Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing.  The ducklings also eat the corn, however.

There are only 8 distinct levels.  The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on.  However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders.  On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.</desc>

		<name>Crazy Golf</name>
		<desc>Nine holes of chaotic top-viewed ricochets and hazards make up this early Crazy Golf game. They can be skipped for a score of 12 if you get stuck. There are no moving hazards, so gameplay is essentially a golf-themed precise positioning puzzle. Furthering this aspect, it does not matter what pace the ball is at when it reaches the hole (it never rebounds out of it) and that rebounds are always at precise 90-degree angles without taking pace out of the ball.

Sixteen shot angles and sixteen shot paces are available. The first hole is simply a row of vertically-placed barriers with only small gaps at each end, but later holes include randomly-placed ball-sized blocks, curved barriers almost enclosing the hole, and square blockades leaving only narrow corridors to play (bounce, more effectively) the ball through. The final hole combines all these for a par-12 challenge.</desc>

		<name>Decathlon</name>
		<desc>Decathlon is a 1-2 player sports game combining ten athletics track and field events.
The game can be played as single events or in a full 10 event competition against the computer or/and a human opponent.

The competing events in the game are the normal: 100m sprint race, 400m dash, 1500m run,
110m hurdles, long jump, high jump, pole vault, shot put, discus throw and javelin throw.

Players can select their country (and the opponents) from eight predefined: UK, France, Germany, Austria, USA, Canada, Japan, Taiwan.
The competitors names are not changeable, e.g. 'Tommy' will always compete for the UK.

Only two players (human or computer) compete against each other in every event, so even if in the 1500m run four characters are running on the track; the two extras are just filling out the field, creating a tripping hazard for the two actual competitors.

Each character has a stamina/power that affects his performance, so the player has to keep within the avatars limits, or he gets too tired.

After a single race, the player gets the option of trying again, or ending the event.

		<name>Flight Path 737</name>
		<desc>Flight Path 737 is a flight simulator or as the cover says an "advanced pilot trainer". The player is the pilot of a jet airliner and his task is to take of from an airport, climb over the mountains that surrounds it and then land safely on an airfield in the valleys below. The player only gets one chance as there is only enough fuel for one landing. The game is played from a first person perspective and the screen is split into two parts: a landscape view at the top and the instrument panel below. The instrument panel shows all the information that is needed such as altitude, speed and artificial horizon. The game can be played on six different skill levels. Each level adds more complexity to the task. On the first level the mountains are 5000 ft. high and the runway is three miles long but for each level the mountains get higher and the runway gets shorter. On the most difficult level the mountains are 9200 ft. and the runway is only 1.5 miles. Each level also adds more tasks that have to be taken care. On level 2 the engine can catch fire, while level 3 require smoother landing. Level 4 to 6 add crosswinds and require reverse thrust when landing.</desc>

		<name>Genghis Khan</name>
		<desc>Genghis Khan is a top-down 2D turn-based grand strategy game, based on the real mongol leader Genghis Khan's life.

The game's main objective is to become the supreme ruler. The player can select from two campaigns: Mongol conquest or World conquest. In the Mongol conquest, players take on the role as Temujin (later known as Genghis Khan), with the goal being to unite all the tribes of Mongolia. In the World conquest, Players can be one of four characters. Similar to the Mongol conquest, players must unite all the countries together. Players can use military force (players must gather an army and lead them into war) or use diplomacy (including things such as strategic marriages). 

The main focus of the game involves management of territory, as the player manages various activities that improve their provinces. Battlefields are hex tiled based, with players giving commands to units groups with the objective of  trying to defeat the forces of the enemy combatants.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1984 film of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call to "bust" any ghost hauntings. They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated "proton packs" and "ghost traps", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the "PK level" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for "ghost alarms", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).

As the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

		<desc>It's been five years since the Ghostbusters roasted the 30 story marshmallow menacing downtown Manhattan. The Ghostbusters sent a huge bill to the city and the city sent back an even bigger bill for damages. Both declared bankruptcy and the now retired Ghostbusters have since moved on. Unknown to the former Ghostbusters, a river of slime has been amassing underneath the city, feeding on all the negative energy of the denizens of New York. Meanwhile a new occupant of the Museum of Art, a 300 year old painting of Vigo the Carpathian and its immortal soul, has arrived and is waiting to get out, eager to use the approaching slime as its medium of escape.

The game starts with the Ghostbusters in trial, with escaped ghosts wrecking havoc in the courtroom. A battle ensues and the player must attempt to vaporize the flying ghost in a sidescrolling environment while dodging ectoplasm thrown by the ghost. Victory or defeat in this battle as well as future battles with ghosts, will be summarized by a newspaper editorial at the end of the battle.

After the courtroom battle, the main game starts in the office of the Ghostbusters. Here the player choose various activities, such as: attempt to gain money by answering distress calls to hunt down ghosts, collect slime from the sewers, test slime (if successfully collected from the sewers), and check the duty rooster.</desc>

		<name>Gilbert - Escape From Drill</name>
		<desc>Gilbert: Escape from Drill is an action game based on the animation series Gilbert. Gilbert, a disgusting alien, has come home after finishing shooting his current TV series. He needs to leave the planet Drill soon because he needs to sign his next contract - but unfortunately the population of Drill are sick of Gilebrt's arrogance. So they stole important parts of his space ship and hid them in town.

The town is a maze-like structure where various enemies try to harm Gilbert, but by using his snot he can oppose them. Killing enough enemies on the same screen cause a power up to appear which can be saved for later (up to four) and has positive effects on Gilbert, e.g floating. The most important part of the town are arcade machines which lead to mini games. After beating a high score (failing to win causes a penalty to the time limit), a part of the space ship is placed in town and Gilbert gets a hint where it can be found.

The machines are:

    Brain Drain: Memory
    Sprout Wars is a shooter
    Greed: Collecting bags in the correct order, but without crossing the own path
    Snot Fight: Skeet shooting
    Earth Invaders: Space Invaders variant</desc>

		<name>Desperado</name>
		<desc>Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out.

Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a railway line.

On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.</desc>

		<desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

		<name>Humphrey (Mr. Micro)</name>
		<desc>Humphrey is a spry chap who needs to change the color of all the blocks. What should be a simple task is made difficult by atomic bombs that drop from block to block so get hopping Humphrey.

Humphrey is a Q*Bert variant. Like in Q*Bert, Humphrey hops from block to block, changing the color of any block he lands on. When all the block's colors are changed, he moves to the next level. Making life difficult are atomic bombs that start at the top and bounce down the board. When they drop off the bottom, they reappear at the top. If Humphrey hits or is hit by an atomic bomb, he loses a life and the current level resets to the beginning. When all lives are gone, the game is over. Unlike Q*Bert, enemies only move down, not up. As the game progresses, there will be more bombs and they will have more bounces.</desc>

		<name>Jaws</name>
		<desc>Loosely based on the fourth movie "Jaws: the Revenge", players take control of a ship to sail the ocean in the search for the killer shark.  Along the way, the ship will stop to allow a diver to swim out and kill baby sharks, jellyfish and manta rays to find conch shells.  The conch shells are used to buy upgrades for the boat.  Extra conch shells can be earned in bonus rounds where a sea plane flies over the water to bomb jellyfish (think the bonus rounds of Galaga with reversed perspective).

The diver will battle Jaws several times in an attempt to wear down his life meter.  If the player is lucky, they can find a submarine to increase their firepower and defense.

If the diver manages to wear down Jaws' energy, they take back to the boat again, launching strobes into the water in an attempt to lure the shark out of the water.  If close enough, the player can use the boat to ram Jaws in an attempt to kill him and win the game.</desc>

		<desc>Macross: Countdown (released outside of Japan as just Macross) is a side-scrolling shoot'em up based on the classic anime series. Players control a Valkyrie fighter that launches from the Macross to rescue Lynn Minmay from the Zentradi. Many waves of enemies must be overcome by evading or shooting at them. A radar at the bottom of the screen displays incoming enemies and obstacles. As in the series, the Valkyrie can transform into one of three different modes, but cannot fire any weapons while transforming: in Fighter mode, it is fast and maneuverable. Speed and maneuverability are lower in Gerwalk mode, which can be useful for getting through tight spots. In Battroid mode, the Valkyrie's projectiles are self-seeking. Only in Fighter and Gerwalk modes, the Valkyrie can launch a powerful missile spread that can take out a lot of enemies at once. The spread is limited to three firings per wave, though.</desc>

		<desc>You play the role of Miner Willy, a bold explorer and adventurer. He discovers a network of underground caverns used by an advanced but now extinct civilization, and realizes that the mines contain lucrative metal ores. Through 20 caverns, you must collect all treasures before all time (air) runs out, watching out for the nasty guardians, the obstacles, dead falls, quicksands and all elements to be found in a classic platform game.</desc>

		<name>Master Of The Lamps</name>
		<desc>Master of the Lamps casts you as an Eastern prince hoping to become King. There are two distinct gameplay sections, through which he must prove his worthiness. Firstly, you must ride a magic carpet, flying through a series of diamonds which twists and turns more as you move through the 41 levels. 

Alternating with this, you are in front of a row of pipes. Hit a gong 3 times to summon a genie, who will play a sequence of notes. Once the last one has been played, they fly towards you in order, and their colour equivalent on the row must be hit (the number of times they are played), before the flying note can hurt you. Complete this and a piece of lamp is granted.</desc>

		<name>Megaphoenix</name>
		<desc>Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot â€˜em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active.

The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.</desc>

		<desc>You control a Zubat as it collects food in the night. The goal is to collect as much food as possible before running into a noxious Koffing, the bane of flying Pokémon it seems. What makes things sticky is that as it's so dark you can't see them! You are a bat though and will be able to use echolocation. Using Supersonic you'll shoot sound waves forward that will let you see upcoming obstacles.

The game scrolls to the left allowing you to fly around the screen that is available. The D-pad allows you to move around the screen and the A/B button will activate your Supersonic attack.

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Skyridge cards, Zubat (117/144) and Golbat (60/144). Or in Japan the Pokémon e-Card expansion 2 cards, Zubat (1/88) and Golbat (3/88).</desc>

		<name>Pastfinder</name>
		<desc>Pastfinder is a vertically scrolling action game which takes place in the year 8878. You are a member of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. 

At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.

Finally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.

The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points.</desc>

There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. 

Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You?ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you?re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. 

Finish all 5 stages in a level and you?ll be presented with a bonus level.</desc>

		<desc>Ever wanted to race dune buggies at high speed on a variety of tracks? Power Drift is an arcade racer that gives you the chance to do just that.

There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. 

Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You?ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you?re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. 

Finish all 5 stages in a level and you?ll be presented with a bonus level.</desc>

		<desc>In this game you will have the possibility to play seven different championships, including the four Grand Slams, so, depending on the competition, you will play on clay, grass or synthetic surface while facing someone of the 11 best ATP players. You also will have the option to train with another player, the computer or using the ball-launcher machine. With the serve training and choosing equipment and surface, you will also improve your game on all the possible conditions. 

If this game is called a simulator it's because: your shots will be different depending on the net distance, the effect and direction of the ball in serve will be defined by you, besides, you will have a total control of the ball direction, shot power and shot style on the moment of the impact (according to the pressed keys), you will be able to access to game stats on every moment, and finally, you will have the possibility of choosing racket and slippers (all of them adapted for every situation).</desc>

		<desc>Punchy is set, as the name might suggest, in a theater setting. It is an adaptation of "Punch &amp; Judy": you are the hunchback Bobby, your goal is to make your way across sixteen theater stages to rescue the beautiful Judy from the Punch. Each stage is filled with the typical hazards of a traditional play, like crocodiles, custard pies and rotten tomatoes, as well as the pits that must be crossed via moving platforms. You'll sometimes have the chance to catch a sausage flying around in the air as you move along.

Even though it is a rather early game, the Spectrum version features some interesting speech samples using a technique that was very uncommon at that time.</desc>

		<desc>River Raid is a vertically scrolling action game. You fly a jet up a river in an attempt to destroy bridges which are vital to the enemy. The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.</desc>

		<desc>Silent Shadow is an arcade with a small aerofighter as protagonist. The objective of the game is to get unharmed with maximum discretion a huge bomber to destroy the enemy fleet in the Persian Gulf. To do so the player has a modern and sophisticated fighter whose power, speed and ability can get to create false images on the radar, making it worthy of the Silent Shadow nickname.

To achieve the goal 4 phases must be overcome (airbase enemy, city, desert and the enemy fleet). The idea is not to depart too much from the bomber to avoid being hit by enemy fire, being destroyed and ending the game, but neither should you go too  slow because you could clash with the bomber, then losing the few opportunities you have. Expansionary pumps are available that can destroy all enemies in sight. The game allows collaborative game where up to 2 players can take one aerofighter.</desc>

		<name>Slapshot</name>
		<desc>Slapshot is an aggressive online street roller-blade hockey game without any principles and rules on the rink. Each game-player logs in and tries to raise his/her level as much as he/she can, playing numerous matches, winning the money, raising their stats, and buying equipment and skills.

There are three kinds of hockey players: Defender, Centre Forward, and Wing Forward. Each of them may be male or female, and they differ by stats. Defender is strong, but slow, while Wing Forward is fast, but not strong. There are 13 stats for each player, which may be raised with level increases and/or with clothes worn or items used.

There are three stages of the game:

1) Tutorial;

2) 1-5 Levels; 

3) 6-50 Levels

During Tutorial stage, you'll learn basic techniques and some tricks available with certain levels.

During 1-5 Levels stage, you may play in 2 kinds of matches:2 human players versus 2 bots
2 human players versus 2 human players

It is a stage to increase your level to 6th, and the ability to earn money if you run out of such on the third stage.

During 6-50 Levels stage, you may play in 3 kinds of matches:1 human player versus 1 human player
2 human players versus 2 human players
3 human players versus 3 human players

It is a stage to increase your level to maximal and become the legend of Slapshot.

Each player may create the room for the rink, adjust its theme, invite others, dismiss unwanted players, protect the room with a password, etc. Winning the money, you as a player may spend it on clothes, which increase your stats, or items such as clubs. Money also may be spent on the skills, which you'll use during gameplay by pressing combination of keys defined for such skill. To master the skill, you may practice in a separate rink.

The hockey gameplay itself is in 3rd person view, while you move your player with arrow keys, and use defined keys to hit the puck, hit the opponent, steal the puck, speed up, use command options, ask a team player for a pass, give a pass  to team player, get ready for a strong hit before a pass, etc. Additional skills allow you to hit the puck sliding left/right, turning in 360 degrees, get out from opponents, hit the puck sliding around the gates, etc. Animation sequences are shown using the game engine, when the match starts, finishes or somebody scores.

During each match some players may have some additional missions (for example to interrupt the pass for 2 times), which gives more money on accomplishment. Tactical and technical actions are calculated for each player during the match and their number and quality influences on experience player gains after the match's end.

Chatting before, after and during the game is possible and allows to understand the desires and mood of each game participant.</desc>

		<name>Space Shuttle - A Journey Into Space</name>
		<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>

		<desc>During World War II a highly guarded compound has been photographed by a reconnaissance plane hidden in a forest. After many intelligent reports it has been discovered that under the compound is a research complex which is getting nearer to the development of a bacterial virus and a new type of rocket which when combined will cause devastation and disease. You and a team of four, have been tasked to parachute into the forest in the surrounding area of the compound to find it's location, then get in the compound before trying to enter the complex. Once in the compound you have to get the plans for the virus, rocket fuel and guidance system before finally blowing the place up. Once your mission has been completed you must then get to a rendezvous point to be picked up by a plane. Remember  though, the surrounding areas have patrolling guards and the compound and complex are heavily guarded.

Before you start you can pick from seven missions where each one is more difficult than the last one. The first mission is just to find the compound and photograph it while the last mission is where you have to actually blow up the complex and reach the rendezvous point. You then choose how long in hours (1-9 times ten) the mission will take before the plane arrives. Each movement in the forest is worth 20 minutes while inside the compound it is 2 minutes. Once you are happy with your selected options you must pick a team of four soldiers to attempt the mission with yourself. There are 30 skills to choose from in which you as the leader have all 30 but the other soldiers only have two of them. You are only aware of one skill for each soldier so you can interview each man to find the other skill or just select them. Each interview will take a day but you only have eight days before the mission starts. 

Once you are happy with your selections you then start the game. You view the forest from above with the whole forest shown on the screen. You cannot see any terrain but just the trees. You are shown as a flashing square and you can see any objects one place around you in the North, South, East and West positions. There are location's that can be found as you explore the area and they are caves, potholes, lakes or houses. These can be explored for any equipment that might be left there and next to the map of the forest is a map of the location you want to explore. You can only see so far in front so you have to move around to see more of the location's passages. Any items found can be picked up. Occasionally in the forest you will come across a patrol and these will need killing. To the right of the forest map again is a map of the area you are in showing your men's positions and the positions of the patrol. You then select which enemy soldier any of your soldiers will shoot at then move your soldier selected two places. You fire at the patrol and then they fire back. You then choose which soldier shoots who again and move them until all the patrol are dead or you have all been killed.

Once you have found the complex, the screen shows an aerial view of the whole complex. Here you then attempt to complete what mission you picked at the start. It is now up to you how you want to enter the compound and move about remembering the guard patrols inside cannot be seen. If you manage to get into the complex without being discovered you move around the complex to complete the missions. Once you have fulfilled your objectives you must get out of the complex, then the compound and finally find the rendezvous point to go home. If you are captured you will be interrogated and shot.</desc>

Each interview will take a day but you only have eight days before the mission starts. 

Once you are happy with your selections you then start the game. You view the forest from above with the whole forest shown on the screen. You cannot see any terrain but just the trees. You are shown as a flashing square and you can see any objects one place around you in the North, South, East and West positions. There are location's that can be found as you explore the area and they are caves, potholes, lakes or houses. These can be explored for any equipment that might be left there and next to the map of the forest is a map of the location you want to explore. You can only see so far in front so you have to move around to see more of the location's passages. Any items found can be picked up. Occasionally in the forest you will come across a patrol and these will need killing. To the right of the forest map again is a map of the area you are in showing your men's positions and the positions of the patrol. You then select which enemy soldier any of your soldiers will shoot at then move your soldier selected two places. You fire at the patrol and then they fire back. You then choose which soldier shoots who again and move them until all the patrol are dead or you have all been killed.

Once you have found the complex, the screen shows an aerial view of the whole complex. Here you then attempt to complete what mission you picked at the start. It is now up to you how you want to enter the compound and move about remembering the guard patrols inside cannot be seen. If you manage to get into the complex without being discovered you move around the complex to complete the missions. Once you have fulfilled your objectives you must get out of the complex, then the compound and finally find the rendezvous point to go home. If you are captured you will be interrogated and shot.</desc>

		<desc>A follow-up to the first Spy vs Spy game now sees the spies stranded on a desert island. This time, instead of the four items which allow you to leave for the airport, the spies must try to collect three pieces of a missile and escape from the island in a waiting submarine before a volcano erupts. There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs.

There are seven difficulty levels which affect how much time will elapse before the volcano erupts and the size of the playing area.</desc>

		<desc>With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches, and then go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</desc>

		<name>Time Scanner</name>
		<desc>Time Scanner is a pinball game. As usual, the goal is to keep the ball in the game by bouncing it back with the paddles. Hitting bumpers and other obstacles rewards points and completing a table requires mastering certain objectives which depend on the table on hand. Every table is divided into twp parts with their own paddles: the game only scrolls if the ball goes down. The four tables are:
Volcano: The winning condition is to spell the table's name by using the associated volcano lanes.
Ruins: In the middle of the table there is a "collect ball" hole. If all targets were hit and two balls were collected in the hole, a special fire ball is set loose. The stage is won when bringing this ball into the hole.
Saqqarah: This pyramid themed table also required spelling a name by knocking down targets and hitting a special hole.
The last table introduces Breakout elements: the player needs to hit blocks to vaporize them.
The first three tables can be freely selected and the last one is unlocked by beating the other three.</desc>

		<name>Ulises</name>
		<desc>The witch Circe imprisoned twelve virgins for a ritual sacrifice. Ulysses, the Greek hero, recently washed away on the beach after a storm destroyed his ship and its crew, is summoned by the populace to rescue the kidnapped women. In exchange, they promise to help him return to Itaca, his home. To aid in his quest, he receives from a wise elder a magical hammer.

Ulises is a side-scrolling platform game from Spain. Although Spanish, the game has almost no text. The Ulysses character moves from left to right throwing hammers to kill an incessant wave of enemies. The game doesn't have levels, but sections within one expansive level. Precise jumps are required to clear abysses and gorges, and to avoid collision with dangerous objects. Ulysses can also crouch. The game starts with three lives, and each rescued damsel adds an extra one. There isn't any form of saving progress.</desc>

		<name>180</name>
		<desc>180 allows you to play a game of darts by yourself or against either the computer or another player. Before you play there are a number of games that can be selected and they are a one player game, two player game, Round the Board or Snooker. The one player game has you trying to get from the score 501 to zero, and you must try to get to zero within 20 darts and also finish with a double or Bullseye. If you manage to finish within 20 darts then you qualify for a league against seven other players and you must try to play one of seven games of darts in the lowest number of darts thrown. If you finish top of the league you then play four rounds of the World Championship which is a knock-out format. 

Two player game has you playing another player with a starting score of 101, 301 or 501 and you can also choose how many games to play from one, three or five. Round the Board is played between one or two players and the idea is to throw a dart in every number in order starting from one in the least number of darts thrown. Snooker is a two player game where you use the dart board to play a game of snooker. There are 15 reds and the other colours that make up a game of snooker and each segment of the board represents a colour. You must throw three darts in one colour to pot that colour starting with a red, and if potted you then choose a different coloured segment.

The dart boards are seen from a 1st person perspective shown on the whole screen. To throw a dart, a line moves below the board and when a key is pressed, it stops the line and shows the position the length on the board the dart will land. Another line now appears to the left of the board and when stopped this shows the height the dart will land.</desc>

This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

		<desc>In this adventure game you control an explorer who's on his way to fortress Alcazar. To reach Alcazar you are travelling through a countryside of fortresses and you need to collect several items that you can find along the way.
Once you enter the Alcazar fortress you have to search for the crown.

The strategy map gives you an overview of the countryside, it's fortresses and your location in it.
What perils lurk in these mysterious castles? Which path is 
quick and safe?
The Alcazar castle is three stories high, all other castles have only two stories. To enter a castle you just have to follow the path.
Each castle has it's own sought-after objects and these objects are always guarded by the castles main demon.
Objects to look for are for example: a rope, a gun, raw meat, water or a raft. Collect them and use them properly to master
the legendary Alcazar fortress.

The game gives you clues and tells,  for example, which monsters are nearby. Some monsters are really hard to kill.

The game can be played at four difficulty levels.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls an "Arachnus 4", an armoured fighting-machine that moves on four legs. The player must first select a sector to play in via a map screen and then control the Arachnus as it wanders an isometric view of the cityscape attacking marauding insects and searching for the insect queen using a scanner. The Arachnus attacks by launching bouncing bombs. It can only launch one at a time so if a bomb misses its intended target the player will have to wait until it hits the scenery or bounces against the fence of the play area before he can fire again. Once the queen has been located, the player can radio-in a "supa-bomb" which can be used to destroy the queen. The player can also radio-in other supplies such as additional bombs and even ask to be pulled out of the combat zone. Extra weaponry costs the player "dosh", the in-game currency.</desc>

		<desc>Angleball is a variation on Pool, using a hexagonal table with 6 pockets and 6 sides. The ball can rebound off these at unusual angles, making the outcomes of shots harder to predict. The basic objective is to pot all the balls, while failing to pot a ball in 3 shots will lose you the frame unless your opponent also fails to do this.

The game can be played by one or two players, with the one-player game consisting of a sequence of 20 different table layouts, each requiring its own style to win. Two-player games can take place on any of these layouts or one of your own design using the inbult table editor. Shot direction, speed and spin can be set on a general level.</desc>

		<desc>The story takes place in a forest, where the evil Count Wolf has kidnapped all of the creatures, save for an elderly rabbit. A tanuki warrior from outside the land, trained in kung-fu just happens to be passing through, so the rabbit granny begs him to use his strength to find Wolf Castle and rescue all of the villagers.

The game presents itself as a standard chop-socky side-scroller, as you pummel apes and flamingos and other woodland creatures. It's not immediately apparent, but the game world is quite large and complex, reportedly containing over 400 screens. The entire world is laid out on a grid, with several horizontal paths that are positioned parallel to each other. As you run across the levels, you'll find arrows that represent places where you can hop onto other areas.</desc>

		<name>Boggy '84</name>
		<desc>Boggy '84 is one of those games of which countless numbers were made in the early eighties during the homecomputer boom. It is slightly similar to Mappy or Space Panic but without the refinements of said games.

You are a man who must collect a set of keys on a level with several floors. You can jump between floors using springboards, which gives you an advantage over your enemies, who must use the ladders to climb between floors. You must also use those in order to descend to a lower floor, mind you. Later levels add touches such as a a ski slope which you must ascend while avoiding the baddies. Hitting them from below will put them out of action, though.</desc>

		<name>Bomb Jack</name>
		<desc>In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the current round and go onto the next one. This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.

In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.

The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</desc>

		<name>Chess Master</name>
		<desc>The ancient game of chess is recreated here, with all the traditional rules and game concepts. The game is in 2D, as the programmers felt this was the most effective use of available memory. Controls involve moving a pointer over the square to move a piece from, pressing space, then moving to the destination square and pressing space again. You can set the amount of time players (human and computer) have to plan moves, although an over-ride option to force a move instantly also exists. You can save and reload games, and at any point can move pieces either from current settings or from scratch, to completely customise the game or play out classic positions.</desc>

Be careful, though, because tanks and enemy aircraft will try to stop you - and they won't stop shooting while you are rescuing those hostages!

Originally released for Apple II home computers, Choplifter! was later ported to the arcades and a number of video game consoles. Many imitators and homages would follow.</desc>

		<desc>This adaptation of cribbage can be played by either two or four players in teams. The main goal is to collect more points than the opponent. In a 2-player game, the players receive six cards each, two of which must be discarded, or in other words, "sent to the Crib". In a 4-player game, everyone receives five cards each and they must discard only one card. During the game, players take turns in owning the Crib (made of all the players' discarded cards). It means that if there are valid point-winning combinations in the Crib, they are added to the respective player's score.

When the actual play begins, every player must place a card on the table. The cards have different values: Ace is 1, 2-10 have the illustrated values, while Jack, Queen and King are worth 10 each. Every player is interested in completing a total value 15 or 31 of all the cards on the table. For example, if there is a 7 placed on the board, the other player should try to put an 8 to make a total of 15. This will add 2 points to his general score. There are other ways of scoring points, as well. Completing a Pair (e.g. two cards of 10) is worth 2 points, Pairs Royal (three of a kind) - 6 points, Double Pairs Royal (four of a kind) - 12 points, Run (three or more consecutive cards) - a number of points equal to the number of cards in the Run, Flush (four or more cards of the same suit) - a number of points equal to the number of cards in the Flush. Even if these combinations are made, the game continues until a total of 15 or 31 is completed. If the players cannot add a card without exceeding a total of 31, GO is called and the cards are removed.

The first player who reaches 121 points in his general score wins. If the opponent has less than 91 points, the winner is awarded 2 games to his match score. The number of games per match can be set in the Options menu.</desc>

		<name>Danger Mouse In The Black Forest Chateau</name>
		<desc>Danger Mouse is back, fighting fit and ready to pit his wits against the mad Baron Silas Greenback in the Black Forest Gateau. Whoops! Chateau.

Colonel K, head of a top secret department in which he does not know its names, sends Danger Mouse, along with his trusted assistant Penfold, to the Black Forest to destroy the Pi-beam, the Baron's secret weapon which poses a threat to world security. After DM says that it is an easy task, he and Penfold leave for Germany in their mousemobile. Unfortunately, finding the Pi-Beam would be difficult since the Baron has set many traps that DM needs to overcome. 

Danger Mouse in the Black Forest Chateau is an adventure game which involves the player reading a description of each scene, and choosing a number of options to proceed through to the next scene. The game is played in two parts. The second part cannot be played unless the first is completed since upon completion, the player is given a code to access the second part.</desc>

		<name>Decathlon</name>
		<desc>Decathlon is a 1-2 player sports game combining ten athletics track and field events.
The game can be played as single events or in a full 10 event competition against the computer or/and a human opponent.

The competing events in the game are the normal: 100m sprint race, 400m dash, 1500m run,
110m hurdles, long jump, high jump, pole vault, shot put, discus throw and javelin throw.

Players can select their country (and the opponents) from eight predefined: UK, France, Germany, Austria, USA, Canada, Japan, Taiwan.
The competitors names are not changeable, e.g. 'Tommy' will always compete for the UK.

Only two players (human or computer) compete against each other in every event, so even if in the 1500m run four characters are running on the track; the two extras are just filling out the field, creating a tripping hazard for the two actual competitors.

Each character has a stamina/power that affects his performance, so the player has to keep within the avatars limits, or he gets too tired.

After a single race, the player gets the option of trying again, or ending the event.

In a full decathlon, a points table is filled in as the events progress.</desc>

		<desc>Wizards Learic and Leanoric have a long-standing feud, and would do anything to see off their rival. As Learic, this is your task. 

Collecting herbs to cast spells is the main basis of the game. There are 24 herbs and flowers to be collected, which are used to make one of 12 spells (the herbs are only used for 1 spell, so there?s no need to decide which spell you?d prefer to have access to). You can use a combination of the spells (including a teleporter, invisibility and a fireball, which you must work our how to use). Leanoric?s direction relative to yourself is indicated by a compass.</desc>

		<desc>From the famous comic strip comes this multi-load action game. Flash has 3 distinct tasks to face, travelling through a desolate forest in the first, shooting or avoiding minions and avoiding the holes. The top half of the screen displays the action, while the bottom half displays a map.

The Cave of Barin is his target, with the aim of taking on Barin in combat using an array of punches and kicks. After this, Flash mounts a motorcycle and rides towards Ming, with guards to fend off and energy gates to pass through in order to replenish before finally taking Ming out.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the 1984 film of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call to "bust" any ghost hauntings. They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated "proton packs" and "ghost traps", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the "PK level" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for "ghost alarms", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).

As the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

		<desc>It's been five years since the Ghostbusters roasted the 30 story marshmallow menacing downtown Manhattan. The Ghostbusters sent a huge bill to the city and the city sent back an even bigger bill for damages. Both declared bankruptcy and the now retired Ghostbusters have since moved on. Unknown to the former Ghostbusters, a river of slime has been amassing underneath the city, feeding on all the negative energy of the denizens of New York. Meanwhile a new occupant of the Museum of Art, a 300 year old painting of Vigo the Carpathian and its immortal soul, has arrived and is waiting to get out, eager to use the approaching slime as its medium of escape.

The game starts with the Ghostbusters in trial, with escaped ghosts wrecking havoc in the courtroom. A battle ensues and the player must attempt to vaporize the flying ghost in a sidescrolling environment while dodging ectoplasm thrown by the ghost. Victory or defeat in this battle as well as future battles with ghosts, will be summarized by a newspaper editorial at the end of the battle.

After the courtroom battle, the main game starts in the office of the Ghostbusters. Here the player choose various activities, such as: attempt to gain money by answering distress calls to hunt down ghosts, collect slime from the sewers, test slime (if successfully collected from the sewers), and check the duty rooster.</desc>

		<name>Guardic</name>
		<desc>Guardic is a top-down 2d shooter based on the classic premise of pitting a single starfighter against a horde of enemies with the fate of the galaxy at hand. A particularly interesting touch in Guardic is that instead of fighting through a scrolling field filled with enemies, the game places your ship in "rooms" with a fixed amount of opponents that take up the most part of the screen. After defeating every enemy on screen you advance to the next room and so on... Power ups are not activated until you reach the next room (with some exceptions) and even then you have to choose which ones to activate before you enter the fight, which gives the game an additional strategic touch.</desc>

To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

		<desc>Buddy Burbank was a B-movie actor who one day met the wealthy Hildegarde Montague and married her. His wife's money allowed him to open his own studio, where he began to produce movies such as Attack of the Killer Rutabagas and other horror titles that gained little critical acclaim but apparently sold rather well. He then died of a heart attack, and Hildegarde followed him soon. In her will, she left the Burbank estate to her favorite nephew, under one condition: he has to find ten famous props from Buddy's movies within one night. 

Hollywood Hijinx is a text adventure game. The player interacts with the environment by typing combinations of verb commands and objects. The game's environment contains secret passages and mazes, which are necessary to explore in order to find the props and successfully complete the game.</desc>

		<desc>Your two best friends Phil and Beverly have been captured by a dark overlord! He is keeping them captive in an active volcano, and you need to rescue them. As Howard the Duck, master of Quack Fu, you need to make your way through the maze-like landscapes, and jump or fight the many obstacles blocking the path using kicks and punches. Water must be navigated around, because this 'superhero' duck can't swim. Or fly without the parachute you regularly use.

Quicksand, enemy mutants and more will all get in your way before you can finally parachute into the volcano and defeat the dark overlord! Howard the Duck is based on 'Escape From Volcano island', a cartoon featuring Howard, but was released to tie in with the movie of the same name.</desc>

		<desc>Christmas is getting close and Santa has a big problem. After returning from holiday he finds all his presents scattered and buried under snow. Things doesn't get any easier with the possible avalanches and all the bad tempered penguins and polar bears that run around and disturb him. It's the player's job to help Santa and retrieve all the presents before Christmas Day. 

Icicle Works is a Boulder Dash variant. The player's objective for each level is to retrieve a number of parcels that are needed to construct a toy. The game is timed and the player loses a life if he doesn't complete a level fast enough. To reach the parcels he has to dig paths through the snow, something that is automatically done when moving through it. The player has to watch out for enemies and different hazards, not least the snow balls that fall into the passages when the player digs next to them. The player then has to move quick to avoid being crushed beneath them. There are also different animals that patrol the passages, like bears and penguin. Some levels has under ground springs that can trap the player if the water is released.  Once all parcels has been collected the player can move on to the next level through a door. A level can be revisited and then all the parcels will appear as bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>Loosely based on the fourth movie "Jaws: the Revenge", players take control of a ship to sail the ocean in the search for the killer shark.  Along the way, the ship will stop to allow a diver to swim out and kill baby sharks, jellyfish and manta rays to find conch shells.  The conch shells are used to buy upgrades for the boat.  Extra conch shells can be earned in bonus rounds where a sea plane flies over the water to bomb jellyfish (think the bonus rounds of Galaga with reversed perspective).

The diver will battle Jaws several times in an attempt to wear down his life meter.  If the player is lucky, they can find a submarine to increase their firepower and defense.

If the diver manages to wear down Jaws' energy, they take back to the boat again, launching strobes into the water in an attempt to lure the shark out of the water.  If close enough, the player can use the boat to ram Jaws in an attempt to kill him and win the game.</desc>

		<desc>The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</desc>

		<desc>After rescuing the wizard Gimbal, the Magic Knight finds himself transported into the 25th century aboard the peaceful trade starship USS Pisces. He must find a way back to his own time.

Knight Tyme is the third game of the Magic Knight series. As in Spellbound, the previous game, the player interacts with the environment through the "Windimation" system: pressing a button brings up a window with a list of commands (pick up/drop/take/give an object, examine, command a character, read something, cast a spell and wear/unwear object). The player can scroll through these with the movement keys, and execute them with the same button used before. Spaceflight is part of the gameplay as the ship must visit several different planets. The spaceship has to be refueled, otherwise the character will be stuck forever in space. There are rooms that kill the knight instantaneously. Usually there is a puzzle associated with these rooms that must be solved in order to access them.</desc>

		<desc>Master of the Lamps casts you as an Eastern prince hoping to become King. There are two distinct gameplay sections, through which he must prove his worthiness. Firstly, you must ride a magic carpet, flying through a series of diamonds which twists and turns more as you move through the 41 levels. 

Alternating with this, you are in front of a row of pipes. Hit a gong 3 times to summon a genie, who will play a sequence of notes. Once the last one has been played, they fly towards you in order, and their colour equivalent on the row must be hit (the number of times they are played), before the flying note can hurt you. Complete this and a piece of lamp is granted.</desc>

		<name>Desolator</name>
		<desc>Desolator is best described as Defender without the little men. What is still there is the fast horizontally scrolling landscape, the green aliens (also known as the Gargoans), the radar and, to a certain extent, the rescue objectives. For lack of humans to rescue, you must instead capture the "Energiser"; an object which certain enemies will try to steal.

The game has, just like other Defender-like games, several types of enemies, from the rather dumb basic aliens, to stationary objects with high firepower, and quick hunters which might crash into you. Each level has a specific objective, though it is usually finished by killing everything that moves. As a last-ditch effort, you can activate the "desolator", which is a fancy name for a smart bomb device, killing everything on-screen.</desc>

		<desc>You control a Zubat as it collects food in the night. The goal is to collect as much food as possible before running into a noxious Koffing, the bane of flying Pokémon it seems. What makes things sticky is that as it's so dark you can't see them! You are a bat though and will be able to use echolocation. Using Supersonic you'll shoot sound waves forward that will let you see upcoming obstacles.

The game scrolls to the left allowing you to fly around the screen that is available. The D-pad allows you to move around the screen and the A/B button will activate your Supersonic attack.

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Skyridge cards, Zubat (117/144) and Golbat (60/144). Or in Japan the Pokémon e-Card expansion 2 cards, Zubat (1/88) and Golbat (3/88).</desc>

		<name>Pastfinder</name>
		<desc>Pastfinder is a vertically scrolling action game which takes place in the year 8878. You are a member of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. 

At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.

Finally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.

The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points.</desc>

		<desc>Pitfall! is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep in the jungle. With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</desc>

		<name>Pitfall 2 - Lost Caverns</name>
		<desc>Pitfall II is the sequel to Pitfall!, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint.</desc>

		<desc>Ever wanted to race dune buggies at high speed on a variety of tracks? Power Drift is an arcade racer that gives you the chance to do just that.

There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. 

Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You?ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you?re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. 

Finish all 5 stages in a level and you?ll be presented with a bonus level.</desc>

		<desc>Punchy is set, as the name might suggest, in a theater setting. It is an adaptation of "Punch &amp; Judy": you are the hunchback Bobby, your goal is to make your way across sixteen theater stages to rescue the beautiful Judy from the Punch. Each stage is filled with the typical hazards of a traditional play, like crocodiles, custard pies and rotten tomatoes, as well as the pits that must be crossed via moving platforms. You'll sometimes have the chance to catch a sausage flying around in the air as you move along.

Even though it is a rather early game, the Spectrum version features some interesting speech samples using a technique that was very uncommon at that time.</desc>

		<desc>River Raid is a vertically scrolling action game. You fly a jet up a river in an attempt to destroy bridges which are vital to the enemy. The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.</desc>

		<name>The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13¾</name>
		<desc>Sue Townsend created a phenomenon in the mid-1980s, essentially incorporating lots of sharp satire and observational humour into the diary of a confused teenager. It might sound like an odd idea for a computer game, but Level 9 felt that there was an adventure in there. Most of the major characters from the book appear, including Adrian's warring parents and their respective flings, his sweetheart Pandora, his best mate Nigel, school bully Barry Kent, and curmudgeonly pensioner Bert Baxter.

The game doesn't use many typed commands. Instead the player reads passages of text (many of them from the book) and is given 3 choices as to what to do, which lead to other events unfolding. You can also use a help option which displays information about characters featured in the diary. Your aim throughout all of this is to make Adrian as popular as possible. The player's score and ranking is displayed at particular times during the game. The percentage achieved relates to the rank, with 26% being 'a spotty creep' and 38% 'a middling thicko' for example.</desc>

As you move around the maze you will encounter many creatures like snakes and these can be shot with your gun but you can only fire horizontally. You are also armed with three bombs which kill everything in the surrounding area. Other obstacles encountered are holes which produce the creatures and if you touch a hole or a creature then you lose one of three lives. The maze is split into various parts and separating each part is a door which requires a key to open it.</desc>

		<name>Snakeman</name>
		<desc>Snakeman is a public domain Oil's Well style game. The idea is to extend a snake down into a maze to collect 'dots'. The body of the snake extends into the maze, and this can't be crossed over, however you may retract the snake in order to take a different route through the maze or to avoid enemies. Should an enemy make contact with your snake, you lose a life. A level is cleared by collecting all the dots in it. Bonus items are scattered around the levels, which reward the player with extra time, points or lives if collected.

Snakeman was programmed in the AMOS programming language.</desc>

		<name>Space Shuttle - A Journey Into Space</name>
		<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>

The level is completed when the satellite is inside the ship and the game then moves on to the next level, where the asteroids and other spacemen become a little faster.</desc>

		<desc>A follow-up to the first Spy vs Spy game now sees the spies stranded on a desert island. This time, instead of the four items which allow you to leave for the airport, the spies must try to collect three pieces of a missile and escape from the island in a waiting submarine before a volcano erupts. There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs.

There are seven difficulty levels which affect how much time will elapse before the volcano erupts and the size of the playing area.</desc>

		<desc>Stormbringer is the fourth and final game to star Magic Knight, and the only one to make it onto 16-bit systems. Magic Knight must meet with his alter-ego, the Off-White Knight, by reaching his castle hideout - which means clearing 64 screens of adventure.

As with the rest of the series, the game uses a largely visual system, in which a press of the fire button calls up a menu of options, such as 'examine', 'pick up' or 'cast spell. Selecting these calls up a sub-menu to choose what should be examined or thrown, which objects to combine, which spells to cast, and so on. The objects to be used include a chicken, a disguise, and eggs. One new feature is that bolts of lightning are fired down at Magic Knight from the sky, and these must be avoided.</desc>

		<desc>The final conflict in the droid wars is up ahead in Jeff Minter's Voidrunner, the second sequel to Gridrunner. After the defeat in the Matrix wars the droids are out for revenge, preparing a nuke to destroy the earth. Therefore a corps of pilots are sent to the droid home planet with the objective to eliminate every single droid.

Gameplay is similar to Gridrunner. Like in Centipede, the enemies move in a pattern down the screen and the player have to shoot them before they reach the ship. There's also the zapper, a vertically moving line, that occasionally pulses. If the player ship is on the same line when this happen, it will die.

The enemies come in many different flavours. The most common ones just explodes when hit, bouncing predictable around the screen. We also have the Gridrunner style aliens that when hit leaves a pod that needs to be destroyed. Typical for a Minter games, you'll also fight furry animals like camels and goats.

New in Voidrunner is that you don't just have one ship, but four. In early levels the ships will move around in a cluster. Later in the game some of your ships will have inverted motion. Some of these formations will have the ships shooting in different directions. Handy when you have enemies coming in from behind.</desc>

		<name>West</name>
		<desc>West is a real-time text adventure set in the Old West of 1885. The protagonist is a sheriff who tracks a gang of robbers who have hidden the money of a bank raid in town. The goal of the game is to retrieve the money and escape the town. An unusual aspect is the introduction of random events that require a quick reaction, along with a certain amount of randomization. The typical text adventure elements are still present, such as movement through the town, lengthy descriptions of the environment (though made shorter when triggered a second time) and solving puzzles, but there are also random encounters.

During the game the player meets Indians, the bank robbers and snakes at random locations and at random intervals. During these the player needs to enter a command before they have a chance to threaten the sheriff. Robbers can be shot, but the player's character can die as well and has three lives. When dead, he respawns at a random location stripped off all items. You also see the results of your previous life and past actions do not need to be repeated. Your lost items can be retrieved by locating your 'old body'. Another random element is that your horse often wanders off in a random direction and needs to be located. It also contains a desert maze that changes each time you restart the game.</desc>

		<name>Zork I - The Great Underground Empire</name>
		<desc>Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I, later known as Zork I, is an interactive fiction computer game written by Marc Blank, Dave Lebling, Bruce Daniels and Tim Anderson and published by Infocom in 1980. It was the first game in the popular Zork trilogy and was released for a wide range of computer systems, followed by Zork II and Zork III. It was Infocom's first game, and sold more than 400,000 copiesnnPLOT:nnThe game takes place in the Zork calendar year 948 GUE (although the passage of time is not notable in gameplay). The player steps into the deliberately vague role of an "adventurer". The game begins near a white house in a small, self-contained area. Although the player is given little instruction, the house provides an obvious point of interest.</desc>

Like its predecessor, Zork II plays like any other text adventure: there are no graphics - only text - and the player types commands such as ''lift cage'' or ''examine robot''.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<desc>The story takes place in a forest, where the evil Count Wolf has kidnapped all of the creatures, save for an elderly rabbit. A tanuki warrior from outside the land, trained in kung-fu just happens to be passing through, so the rabbit granny begs him to use his strength to find Wolf Castle and rescue all of the villagers.

The game presents itself as a standard chop-socky side-scroller, as you pummel apes and flamingos and other woodland creatures. It's not immediately apparent, but the game world is quite large and complex, reportedly containing over 400 screens. The entire world is laid out on a grid, with several horizontal paths that are positioned parallel to each other. As you run across the levels, you'll find arrows that represent places where you can hop onto other areas.</desc>

		<desc>The story takes place in a forest, where the evil Count Wolf has kidnapped all of the creatures, save for an elderly rabbit. A tanuki warrior from outside the land, trained in kung-fu just happens to be passing through, so the rabbit granny begs him to use his strength to find Wolf Castle and rescue all of the villagers.

The game presents itself as a standard chop-socky side-scroller, as you pummel apes and flamingos and other woodland creatures. It's not immediately apparent, but the game world is quite large and complex, reportedly containing over 400 screens. The entire world is laid out on a grid, with several horizontal paths that are positioned parallel to each other. As you run across the levels, you'll find arrows that represent places where you can hop onto other areas.</desc>

		<desc>Boggy '84 is one of those games of which countless numbers were made in the early eighties during the homecomputer boom. It is slightly similar to Mappy or Space Panic but without the refinements of said games.

You are a man who must collect a set of keys on a level with several floors. You can jump between floors using springboards, which gives you an advantage over your enemies, who must use the ladders to climb between floors. You must also use those in order to descend to a lower floor, mind you. Later levels add touches such as a a ski slope which you must ascend while avoiding the baddies. Hitting them from below will put them out of action, though.</desc>

The green man hunts you as you go around the screen, and if you don't move in a careful fashion, he will corner you. Bushes may slow down the green man's steps. Sometimes, the green man will tire, and you will have a bonus screen where you can go about disarming bombs at your own pace.</desc>

		<name>Chack'n Pop</name>
		<desc>Chack'n Pop is considered  a predecessor of  Bubble Bobble. It is a platform game where a roundish yellow creature, named Chack'n, must fight against Monstas and Mightas in order to reclaim hearts that were stolen during a romantic encounter with Miss Chack'n.

The Monstas themselves hatch from eggs hanging from the ceilings and the Mightas push a rock that is used as the game's timer. The Monsta eggs have three phases:  if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an egg turns red it will pop almost immediately.

Chack'n uses bombs to blow up the Monstas and their eggs and he also uses them to release the captured hearts from their cages. When the heart is released, it will fly up and destroy the separator block and reveal the exit to the level.

Most versions of the game contain 14 levels to play through, however the Famicom version only includes 9.</desc>

		<desc>The ancient game of chess is recreated here, with all the traditional rules and game concepts. The game is in 2D, as the programmers felt this was the most effective use of available memory. Controls involve moving a pointer over the square to move a piece from, pressing space, then moving to the destination square and pressing space again. You can set the amount of time players (human and computer) have to plan moves, although an over-ride option to force a move instantly also exists. You can save and reload games, and at any point can move pieces either from current settings or from scratch, to completely customise the game or play out classic positions.</desc>

		<desc>The subtitle "The moving puzzle game" should be interpreted literally; this is a puzzle game where the picture on the puzzle pieces are constantly animated. This can make piecing together the pieces quite difficult, or at least call for strategies not used in conventional puzzles.

There are ten puzzles to choose from, and these can be divided into anything from 2x2 to 12x8 pieces. The pieces are not only scattered, they may also be turned upside down. 

As you play the puzzle, your score starts to count down, and the rate of the countdown is heightened when you execute moves, turn the pieces or use the special features which will reveal a glimpse of the finished puzzle, automatically lay out pieces, or halt the animation. If the score reaches zero, the game is over.</desc>

		<name>The Cure</name>
		<desc>Winning entry in the MSXdev'05 coding competition, The Cure is an arcade jump&amp;run heavily influenced by Konami's classic Vampire Killer.

The hero, who does look a bit like The Cure's Robert Smith dressed in Mega Man's clothes, starts out in a demonic landscape on his quest to rid the land of the most evil One and his minions. After traversing the cursed landscape, you enter a castle, which will be directly recognisable to anyone who has played Castlevania.

Equipped only with a whip, the hero must choose his battles. However, strewn across the levels are keys which will open chests containing bonuses which will render (short-term) invincibility, lengthen your whip or grant you a subweapon, such as a throwing dagger or an hourglass to freeze time momentarily. Subweapons consume hearts, which can be found not only in chests, but by destroying monsters or whipping down candles from the castle's walls.

The Cure features a soundtrack with several pieces throughout, swap-screen "scrolling" and both hardware and plotted sprites.(Moby Games)</desc>

		<desc>In Door Door, players take on the role of Chun. Chun's goal is to trap four different enemy alien types behind doors.

Door Door is a platform game in which Chun has to lock up the alien creatures that pursue him. Chun can attempt to lock as many aliens as he can behind each door that is available on a particular stage. Chun can slide open a door, wait for the alien(s) to enter and then he has to quickly shut the door, because if he waits to long the captured aliens will walk out and pursue him again. Each stage is completed when all the enemy aliens are trapped behind doors.</desc>

		<name>Griel's Quest for the Sangraal</name>
		<desc>Griel's Quest for the Sangraal is an MSX1 remake of the old MSX2 puzzle game, Griel no Seihai by Momonoki House, first published in Peach Up magazine 1990.

The gameplay is similar both to Soukoban and the Lolo games, though the focus is not on moving boxes around. Instead, you are a knight who must pick up magic objects to vanquish evil creatures. The following objects can be found:
Magical Staff â€“ Vanquishes RPG slimes.
Holy Cross â€“ Vanquishes ghosts.
Sacred Sword â€“ Kills ogres.
Only one magical object may be carried at any one time, and it cannot be dropped. The only way to get rid of an object is to use it against an enemy. Just as in the aforementioned puzzle games, the emphasis is therefore on picking up objects in the right order. This can get very tricky not only if a monster is in front of a desirable object, but also if it is behind an object which you can't pick up or can't use against any enemy within your reach. To complicate matters, many levels contain tiles which only allow movement in one direction, so that one can easily get stuck and must forfeit. Luckily, the monsters are immobile, so that at least timing is not a variable in the quest for the Sangraal. To aid you in your quest, you are given a password every five levels.

This adaptation was made for the MSXdev '05 coding contest.</desc>

		<name>Guardic</name>
		<desc>Guardic is a top-down 2d shooter based on the classic premise of pitting a single starfighter against a horde of enemies with the fate of the galaxy at hand. A particularly interesting touch in Guardic is that instead of fighting through a scrolling field filled with enemies, the game places your ship in "rooms" with a fixed amount of opponents that take up the most part of the screen. After defeating every enemy on screen you advance to the next room and so on... Power ups are not activated until you reach the next room (with some exceptions) and even then you have to choose which ones to activate before you enter the fight, which gives the game an additional strategic touch.</desc>

		<desc>When Guru Logic Champ was released for the Gameboy Advance, it soon became apparent that the game was simple enough in concept to be ported to much simpler systems. One Spanish programmer took it upon himself to port the title to the humble MSX1, and released it as part of the MSXdev'03 contest. However, he never asked the then-defunct Compile for permission. The game uses the exact same rules and even the same puzzles as the GBA original, as well as the original sprites. The graphics make good use of the limited power of the MSX, with many colours, and even renders the player character using multicolour sprites. Due to the limitations in the number of sprites that may be displayed, only one duck is responsible for shooting the blocks that fill in the picture that is to be completed for each level (the GBA original uses two ducks).</desc>

		<desc>Hopper borrows the Frogger style of gameplay, for one of many games inspired by the arcade hit. The road has six lanes to cross, each very densely populated with traffic. Permanent logs and temporary turtles are used to get across the river, and reach one of the five home cells. After filling all of them the game moves up to a higher difficulty level. A range of keys can be used for each control function.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Chef &amp; The Sausages</name>
		<desc>Mr. Chef is preparing a big meat, but he has a problem; the Sausages are rebelling and offering big resistance. Help him to make a delicious meat: "Rico Rico".

You may shoot the sausage and beware of the sausage's shoots. Just that! If you shoot the sausage, you will gain 10 points. The top is 1900 points (as in the real machine), then it starts again from zero at Mode Play 2. If you are hit by a shoot, you loose one live. You have three of them. You can recover lives at 500, 1000 and 1500 points.

Note: Mode Play 1 is for cowards!</desc>

Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</desc>

		<name>Parachuteless Joe</name>
		<desc>The Skysurf Team's performance begins at 15.000 feet. The parachute opens at 2.500 feet. The Skysurfer does a free fall at about 180 Kmph and moves horizontally at about 50 mph. This descent lasts 50-70 seconds while he does rotations and aerobatic acts and feels the pressure of the wind over the board at the same time. The board slides over the ultimate wave... the sky.

But Joe is a clear-ideas man. He thinks that life is for living it as it comes and even if you smash against floor in the end, it is better to do it with style and guts. So he does not need a parachute. If he smashes several times, doing more and more positions and proving agility and reflex he will be remembered as a real macho man and will become part of history. He will be, or course, the best skysurfer ever too. Besides a new era will start with him, the behaviour study and human philosophy. You can believe it or not, but it will happen.</desc>

		<desc>MODE 1: The best of five. The players have to bet for a penguin from 1 to 3. The winner will be given a white square in one of his/her three empty boxes. The one who gets three white squares is the winner. The player (human) can play against a friend (human) or against the MSX (MSX1). 

MODE 2: Bet your fish. It's a only two players mode. You have to play against a friend of yours. You both are given 25 fish to start with. Then, again, you have to bet for a penguin but, firstly, you are asked for betting some fish; you can bet from 1 to 4 fish. The one has no fish left loses and the one who has 83 fish wins. I decided to set 83 as the maximum because the MSX was created in 1983, 20 years ago, which is the leitmotiv of this competition.</desc>

		<desc>This game consists in directing an explorer through a gigantic map in the search of four coffee coats which are distributed on it. In the territory where the action takes place we can find rivers, fences, trees, rocks and some more things which can suppose an obstacle for accomplishing the mission. All that together with the presence of killer indigenous serpents which will try to finish with us.

The map has 100 screens that we must cross if we want to find the four coats. Nevertheless, it's necessary to consider that at least one of them is always located inside the cave, which we will only be able to open if previously we found the key. There are also many objects distributed on the way that can help us: boats to cross rivers, tips to break rocks, machetes to cut to the vegetation, etc.</desc>

All that together with the presence of killer indigenous serpents which will try to finish with us.

The map has 100 screens that we must cross if we want to find the four coats. Nevertheless, it's necessary to consider that at least one of them is always located inside the cave, which we will only be able to open if previously we found the key. There are also many objects distributed on the way that can help us: boats to cross rivers, tips to break rocks, machetes to cut to the vegetation, etc.</desc>

		<desc>Soko-Ban is a classic puzzle game, the basis of numerous clones in the later years. It is set in a warehouse. On each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.</desc>

		<desc>A follow-up to the first Spy vs Spy game now sees the spies stranded on a desert island. This time, instead of the four items which allow you to leave for the airport, the spies must try to collect three pieces of a missile and escape from the island in a waiting submarine before a volcano erupts. There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs.

There are seven difficulty levels which affect how much time will elapse before the volcano erupts and the size of the playing area.</desc>

		<desc>Super Columns is an updated version of Columns with more options of play, but with the same setup, maneuvering falling blocks into groups of three or more to eliminate them from the screen.  Along with a Versus mode there is also a Story mode as well.

An evil sorcerer by the name of Surhand has stolen a mystical amulet which brings peace and serenity to the land of Phoenicia and hopes to use it to bring death and destruction to the land.  The player must battle their way through his four guards in a series of best two-out-of-three games of Columns in order to face off against Surhand and bring peace back to the land.

The Flash Mode also returns to this version as well as the new Endless Mode where the main objective is to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out.  There are also special columns throughout these modes such as Glitter Columns which eliminates all blocks of the same color on the screen at once as well as Stone Block Columns which can only be eliminated through magic power-ups that can be obtained by eliminating the base blocks.</desc>

On the contrary, you'll have to avoid the meteorites, that will fall faster and faster in every stage, and its number will grow as well. Every time a T-Virus or a meteorite hits you, or every time a T-Virus escapes (crosses the bottom of the screen) your energy will decrease (from 6 to 0). You die when you run out of energy.</desc>

		<desc>Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of ?Turmoil? is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.

The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds.  The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.
 
When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens.  There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</desc>

		<desc>This little strategy game it's a remake from an old Dragon computer "classic" developed in 1982 by Prickly-Pear Software. The MSX version is a 16Kb BASIC ROM game with some little assembler routines to speed up graphics. Most of the original code is still there and so the original playability, there was even some bugs that I solved. Hope you like as I like it back in the 80's!

Be a leader is always a hard task!, now your objective in the game is to become King (and richer!) as fast as possible. Simple; but very addictive! :) Till four players are supported with nine levels of difficulty, the bigger, the harder. Online instructions are present in every game screen so you only need to read what is being displayed ;)</desc>

		<name>10 Yard Fight</name>
		<desc>The main idea of this game is that players take control of a football team and have the task of trying to score a touchdown before the clock runs out.

Players start out as a high school team. Games consists of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game, and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.

Since the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the players score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point. 

Other rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or go four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.


In a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense.</desc>

In A.E. the earth is under attack by swarms of aliens who drop bomb after bomb and it's your job to defend planet Earth.

		<name>Adven'chuta!</name>
		<desc>Taking its title from the English word "adventure" and the squeak of a mouse; "chu", Adven'chuta is an old school adventure game, not far from Atari's old Adventure.

As a mouse, you must get around a dungeon populated by dangerous frogs and spiders. There are jars which may contain both treasures and danger, and which block the way. You have an inventory, but it can only contain one item at any time. Take care in what you pick up and leave behind. Juggling the inventory becomes a basic skill since items will block the narrow passages of the dungeon. Basic items are keys, for opening the door to the next dungeon, as well as cheese, which is good for the adventuring mouse's stamina. The dungeon must be completed within a set time or it's game over.

Control the mouse with the cursor keys, and use the following keys to issue commands:

B: Crush jar
T: Take item
O: Open door
P: Leave item behind
E: Eat cheese
K: Kick frog</desc>

Aliens: Alien 2 is an arcade platformer (or run'n'gun if you like) featuring Ripley on a planet infested with aliens. Armed with only a basic gun at first, she faces facehuggers that come out of alien eggs. After having dispatched a face hugger, the egg may be shot to reveal an item. Items may be hand grenades, stronger guns or wing items which make her jump longer. For some reason, the planet is infested not only with aliens and their offspring, but also with snakes. After clearing the surface level, Ripley enters a complex where the first boss, a giant, full-grown alien resides. The following level takes place within the complex.</desc>

		<desc>Enix kickstarted the whole mystery Japanese adventure game craze of the 80s with Portopia Satsujin Renzoku Jiken, which was followed up by two sequels, all three of which were helmed by star developer Yuji Horii. Lesser known is this game, Animal Land Satsujin Jiken (“Animal Land Murder Case”), despite following the same mold…except all of the characters are anthropomorphic animals. The story puts you in the shoes of a rookie canine shamus named Oidon, as he investigates the murder of Gonkichi, a fox and owner of a jewelry store. The story gets even darker when the case interweaves with the suicide a panda named Linlin.</desc>

		<name>Aquattack</name>
		<desc>Agent Captain Blitztek has to find a way through enemy territory to prevent the Axtoatles from taking control of the world. 

Aquattack is an action game with four levels which partly have varying gameplay mechanics. In level one and two, the player mans a motor boat which needs to travel a certain distance from left to right. Of course there is a lot of enemy opposition which needs to be avoided. Some enemies can be shot while others are out of reach. Fuel is limited and needs to replenished by collecting refreshments dropped by allied planes. Level three is similar; the player uses a hang glider now. There are different enemies to fight and no fuel to collect. In level four, there is a guarded energy field to cross in order to bring four bombs to the other side. However, only one bomb can be transported at once and there is a time limit.

After beating all four levels, they loop with more difficult enemies and faster playing speed.  The player can take nine hits and the overall goal is to earn as many points as possible before the unavoidable final death occurs.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Back Gammon (Japan) (Alt).rom</path>
		<name>Backgammon</name>
		<desc>This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual.

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:

All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.

No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.

A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.

After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.

If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Difficulty switches

Right:

A=computer rolls dice for you

B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers

Left:

A=computer sets up the board for you

B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

Game variations

Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player

Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player

Games one through four are backgammon

Games five through eight are acey deucey

Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Back to the Future (Japan) (Alt).rom</path>
		<name>Back to the Future</name>
		<desc>In Back to the Future, 80s teen Marty McFly is mistakenly send 30 years into the past where he disrupts his own parents from meeting. Faced with extinction at the hands of a temporal paradox, Marty must find a way to reunite his future parents and make it back to his own time.

LJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.

Street running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).</desc>

		<name>Balance</name>
		<desc>This German game of dexterity delivers what the title promises. Balance is a lesson in applied gravity: guide a ball to one or more targets by tilting the plane it sits on, much like in those little plastic toys that drive you insane. A simple premise made challenging by tricky, maze-like level layouts that go beyond the "A to B" routine, but require you to touch a certain number of target tiles in no particular order. You must reach all targets in limited time, or else you have to start over. If the ball falls off the edge, one of ten lives is lost. Special fields such as jumpers, accelerators or crumbling tiles test your reflexes; some levels even rotate.

Balance uses vector graphics to draw flat, untextured fields on which the ball rolls. The plane is tilted with the mouse. Every few levels, you get a password to jump directly to that map. Even so, Balance is extremely difficult and only recommended for players with *a lot* of patience.</desc>

		<name>Balance</name>
		<desc>This German game of dexterity delivers what the title promises. Balance is a lesson in applied gravity: guide a ball to one or more targets by tilting the plane it sits on, much like in those little plastic toys that drive you insane. A simple premise made challenging by tricky, maze-like level layouts that go beyond the "A to B" routine, but require you to touch a certain number of target tiles in no particular order. You must reach all targets in limited time, or else you have to start over. If the ball falls off the edge, one of ten lives is lost. Special fields such as jumpers, accelerators or crumbling tiles test your reflexes; some levels even rotate.

Balance uses vector graphics to draw flat, untextured fields on which the ball rolls. The plane is tilted with the mouse. Every few levels, you get a password to jump directly to that map. Even so, Balance is extremely difficult and only recommended for players with *a lot* of patience.</desc>

		<name>Banana</name>
		<desc>Banana is a puzzle game based on the Mole Mole games, where you have to navigate a mole through various levels, making it to the exit. The task is not as simple as it sounds. First, the mole cannot jump or climb up unless there is a ladder nearby. So you have to plan your route ahead, otherwise you can get stuck at the bottom. Second, boulders will fall and block your way. And third, you have a wife. You should first find her, and then lead her securely to the exit. The wife will sometimes make things harder, forcing you to find alternate ways to the exit. But sometimes she'll also be helpful, pushing away boulders and clearing the road for you. 

On every level, there is also various food scattered around, primarily bananas. You'll be able to complete a level if you have gathered enough of those fruits. You'll also gain superpowers from bananas that will allow you to skip level sections that you find too difficult. The entire game is played only with the four directional buttons. There are no enemies and you cannot die - although you can get irrevocably stuck, in which case you'll have to restart a level.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Bank Panic (Japan) (Alt).rom</path>
		<name>Bank Panic</name>
		<desc>As a gunslinger, it's your job to protect a bank from bandits while taking care not to shoot innocent customers. The bank has 12 doors in front of 12 teller windows, with only three doors visible at a time. Shooting is done simply by pressing one of the three buttons to shoot the left, middle or right door. The player can move his viewpoint left and right to reveal new doors. People only appear behind the doors that are currently visible on screen, except for the rare outlaws who will pop up to steal a cash deposit from a teller window the player isn't watching. Indicators at the top of the screen show how much time it will take before someone will show up at a door. 

If a bandit appears behind a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot him before he shoots you. If you shoot him too early (i.e. before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair and gives very little score, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. Sometimes a bandit will stick dynamite on one of the doors. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you take too long, the bomb explodes (even if it's offscreen) and you lose a life. 

If you're lucky, a customer will appear behind the door and deposit a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. Sometimes a bandit will suddenly take the customer hostage and replace them in the door. 

At other times, a cowboy will appear with a stack of hats. Shooting off all the hats before the door closes grants a cash deposit and a big score bonus. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins. 

There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you're on, there is a time limit.</desc>

		<name>Batman</name>
		<desc>The TurboGrafx-16 version of Batman: The Video Game is a top-down maze-like game, somewhat similar to Pac-Man or Bomberman.

The game consists of five stages based on the movie: the Streets of Gotham, Flugelheim Museum, AXIS Chemical Factory, the Parade and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker. The first four stages are divided into 12 sub-stages or mazes. Each main level has its own objective, which basically consists of finding items in the mazes: collecting "smilex" components in the streets of Gotham, cleaning paintings at the museum, planting bombs at the factory and cutting off the ropes of Joker's balloons at the parade. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed.

Batman can attack his enemies with his Batarang. Through the levels, he will collect items which will upgrade his speed and give his Batarang a longer range and multiple shots.</desc>

A tanuki warrior from outside the land, trained in kung-fu just happens to be passing through, so the rabbit granny begs him to use his strength to find Wolf Castle and rescue all of the villagers.

The game presents itself as a standard chop-socky side-scroller, as you pummel apes and flamingos and other woodland creatures. It's not immediately apparent, but the game world is quite large and complex, reportedly containing over 400 screens. The entire world is laid out on a grid, with several horizontal paths that are positioned parallel to each other.

		<name>Beach-Head</name>
		<desc>A dictator took the control of a fortress on the island of Kuhn-Lin.

The player's mission is to storm the island and recapture it. This takes place over the course of six different sequences. The first sequence is Aerial Reconnaissance, where the fleet must be moved directly past the enemy or into a hidden passage to trigger another, optional stage. In this Hidden Passage sequence, the player will have to maneuver around mines and torpedoes. Successfully completing it gives a surprise advantage in the following General Quarters sequence, where the player controls anti-aircraft guns shooting down enemy aircraft.

The next sequence is named Battle Stations and the player must aim and fire heavy guns to hit enemy ships before they inflict too much damage and eventually sink the player's own vessels.  Following this battle, the fleet must be maneuvered to the beach. 
Upon reaching the Beach-Head level, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire and obstacles while driving. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.

The port for C16 and Plus/4 computers only contains the General Quarters, Battle Stations and Final Battle sequences.</desc>

The penguins start on opposite sides, separated by walls, bricks, and other obstacles. You take control of one of the penguins. The other makes exactly the same movements as you, but in the opposite direction. So if for example you see an enemy to the left of the penguin you are not controlling, you have to fire to the right in order to hit it. You have to reach the top of the level in such a way that the two penguins will arrive at the top square at the same time, coming from opposite sides. Enemies such as spiders will put web on your way or attack you. You can kill them for points. There are various power-ups that appear randomly on the levels. You should also be careful not to run out of time.</desc>

In order to find this mysterious artifact, they have to venture into a system of dungeons and to defeat the monsters that live in them.

The sequel to Black Onyx is very similar to its predecessor, graphically as well as gameplay-wise. You build a party of up to five adventurers and take them to fight in first-person 3D dungeons. You encounter random enemies as well as fellow adventurers, whom you can recruit to your party if it is not full.</desc>

		<name>The Black Onyx</name>
		<desc>Rumor says that the legendary Black Onyx, an artifact that grants eternal youth and happiness to those who can find it, lies within the Black Tower near the town of Utsuro. You assemble a party of brave adventurers and venture into the tower, defeating monsters on your way to the great treasure.

The Black Onyx is one of the first traditional role-playing games made by a Japanese company. It is similar in gameplay to early Wizardry and Ultima games with killing monsters and exploring dungeons, with dark, realistic visuals. The player creates a party (up to five members) and explores a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on the way. The heroes also meet adventurers who can be convinced to join the party. The combat engine is turn-based.</desc>

There are 30 levels to be completed. Blagger must perform these tasks under a time limit while avoiding hazards such as cacti, cars, aliens, mad hatters, giant mouths, and chinamen. Blagger has no weapon to shoot these, but must rely on his jumping skills. He loses a life if he comes into contact with a hazard or falls long distances, or if he runs out of time. As usual, the game ends when all lives are lost. If Blagger successfully grabs the keys and makes his way to the safe, he proceeds to the next location.</desc>

You can move only from right to left while the screen scrolls down. The playing field is filled with different blocks and your aim is to fill them in so they form complete rectangles or squares. Only when you succeed in this mission, the concerned blocks will disappear. New 'unformed' blocks appear while the playing field scrolls down making you play into full action at all times. As soon as a line of blocks reaches the bottom line, it is Game Over.</desc>

		<desc>In Fraction Fever, the player's goal is to advance floors up to the twentieth with the help of his pogo stick and the Fraction Elevators located on each floor. To find them, the player needs to look for the correct fraction pictures, matching what is shown at the top of the screen, while a radar shows the layout of floors at the bottom. Incorrect fractions can be knocked down for scoring points, but this leaves holes in the floors. When the player doesn't manage to jump over these and falls down far enough or several times, the game will end. There is also a time limit to look out for, if the clock reaches zero the Fraction Elevator of the current floor cannot be reached, and the player has to jump down a floor to be able to try again.</desc>

In a desperate attempt, you decide to walk to king Ogreth's castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your soldiers back to you...

In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple – just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand.</desc>

In a desperate attempt, you decide to walk to king Ogreth's castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your soldiers back to you...

In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple – just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand.</desc>

		<name>Bomber King</name>
		<desc>RoboWarrior takes place on an alien planet called Altile. The player operates a cyborg named ZED (Z-type Earth Defence). In the game, ZED raids Altile to fight the Xantho empire and destroy its leader, Xur. ZED deploys bombs to clear a path through rocks, walls, and forests, while killing enemies and collecting items. Some gameplay elements resemble those of Bomberman (1983).

RoboWarrior comprises five level formats. In one, the player must obtain a key before the time limit expires. In another, the key is unavailable until the player acquires a crystal or chalice. Some levels are cast in darkness, rendering obstructions invisible unless the player has a lit lamp. Still other levels are mazes in which a player must find and blast-through weak points in walls to proceed. Periodically, a player engages a boss level.</desc>

		<name>Bomber Man Special</name>
		<desc>Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series, Bomberman is a single-player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, the player only has a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (four directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. The goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.

There are 16 levels to be completed and five different skill levels available, which affect the number of jewels which must be collected and the time limit.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Break In (Japan).rom</path>
		<name>Break In</name>
		<desc>As the title implies, this is a game about breaking into banks, as well as a Break-Out clone.

Each level is a bank, consisting of several rooms. You can only leave a room after your ball hits a key. As a burgler, you are symbolised by a pair of eyes, on top of which a paddle rests. Similarly to Woody Pop, parts of the bottom of the screen is covered up, so that you need not guard the ball as much as in other games. Unlike most Break-Out clones, you can move freely over the entire screen so as to hit the ball at the perfect spot. If you miss the ball and it passes through the void at the bottom, it falls back into the earlier rooms, just like in the Amiga classic, Poing. If you catch it there, you can send it back to the room your were in. In the last room of each bank, you should hit the money that is in there, before you hit the square with a calculator, which will calculate your score for that bank. Later vaults feature a bell which must not be hit, or it will wake a guardian that will hunt you across the screen.

As in all post-Arkanoids, powerups are available, in the shape of a circle that bounces across the screen, all the while changing colours. Depending on which colour it is when you pick it up with your paddle, you get one bonus out of a range which corresponds to the basics of most games in the genre, such as wider paddle, sticky paddle, multiball and firepower.</desc>

		<desc>This is clone version of the 1983 Mario Bros.game. Mario and Luigi, the best plumbers in the world, have a real job on their hands. A host of characters have taken over the sewers, and the brothers must clear them out of the pipes.

The platform puzzle which first introduced Luigi to the world has both single and multiplayer action with two differing game types, but with the same objective. Crabs, turtles and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping underneath the platform they sit on, then kicking them away. Each level is cleared when a set number of coins is collected.

For the two player mode, the first to collect the set amount of coins wins.</desc>

		<name>Bruce Lee</name>
		<desc>The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. 

In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders.  There are 20 areas to be completed.

On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. The game also allows a second player to take control of Yamo.

There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.</desc>

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms.</desc>

		<name>Burger Time</name>
		<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step over every burger ingredient. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also "bump" any other ingredient below it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud that will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.</desc>

		<name>Car Jamboree</name>
		<desc>Car Jamboree is a conversion of the arcade game with the same name.
In this game, which can be played by one or two players, you control a car and compete with three other cars in an squared arena. Your goal is to destroy the other three cars by crashing into them on the side. A head-on collision has no effect.
When all three other cars have been taken out of competition you advance to the next level.
In some levels the arena can contain a ramp, which can be used to jump on other cars or a pond in the middle in which you can try to push the other cars to take them out of the competition.

All this has to be done before you run out of fuel. If any fuel left then you'll receive bonus points.</desc>

		<name>Pachinko - U.F.O.</name>
		<desc>Pachinko UFO is a simulator of the popular Japanese gambling pastime of pachinko with added computerised action elements. The main screen resembles a typical pachinko unit with pins for balls to bounce on, spinners for balls to put in motion, and baskets for them to land in. The baskets open and close, and so does the big feature in the middle of the screen, an airplane or spaceship with an integrated fruit-machine like counter. When a score specified by the counters is reached, the game changes to a shooter sequence, where the pachinko balls must be used to shoot down aliens. After that, the game continues to the next table.

The control mechanism is similar to golf games, in that the longer you press the button, the more power is given to the ball ejection mechanism. This makes for an experience unlike a real pachinko machine, where the perfect power of the ejector is reached by setting a dial at the right angle, after which it can be locked at that angle. In Pachinko UFO, you must hit a perfect timing instead.

The Monstas themselves hatch from eggs hanging from the ceilings and the Mightas push a rock that is used as the game's timer. The Monsta eggs have three phases:  if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an egg turns red it will pop almost immediately.

Chack'n uses bombs to blow up the Monstas and their eggs and he also uses them to release the captured hearts from their cages. When the heart is released, it will fly up and destroy the separator block and reveal the exit to the level.

Most versions of the game contain 14 levels to play through, however the Famicom version only includes 9.</desc>

The components from which a car must be built are chassis, engine and coachwork, what of course must occur in the correct order. During your attempt to build cars you are pursued by hostile cars and tanks. When the first car is assembled entirely it then will change into a coin. Collecting that coin gives you temporarily invulnerability, so you can chase the hostile cars and tanks for bonuses. Don't drive too fast or you will fall from the platform or crash into the wall.</desc>

		<desc>Comecocos can be defined, basically, as Pac-Man with new mazes. In this way, the game retains intact the original concept of the Namco's classic game, with the only addition of new mazes of crescent shapes.

The game doesn't let you modify any parameters - in fact the main (and only) menu only have two options: play and exit. At least the game saves the ten best scores in a high score table.</desc>

		<name>Confused</name>
		<desc>The subtitle "The moving puzzle game" should be interpreted literally; this is a puzzle game where the picture on the puzzle pieces are constantly animated. This can make piecing together the pieces quite difficult, or at least call for strategies not used in conventional puzzles.

There are ten puzzles to choose from, and these can be divided into anything from 2x2 to 12x8 pieces. The pieces are not only scattered, they may also be turned upside down. 

As you play the puzzle, your score starts to count down, and the rate of the countdown is heightened when you execute moves, turn the pieces or use the special features which will reveal a glimpse of the finished puzzle, automatically lay out pieces, or halt the animation. If the score reaches zero, the game is over.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Courageous Perseus (Japan) (Alt).rom</path>
		<name>Courageous Perseus</name>
		<desc>Courageous Perseus is one of the very first Action RPGs from Japan, being released one month before Hydlide and in the same month as Falcom's Dragon Slayer. However, while the other two have spawned successful series, Courageous Perseus has been mostly forgotten.

You play as the legendary hero Perseus who sets out to an island full of mythical beasts in order to save the Pleiades Maia, Celaeno, and Asterope. Perseus starts with 2000HP, but his health is constantly being drained one point per second. Enemies are attacked simply by bumping into them while holding the Space bar pressed.

Story 

Located in the south of the ocean is an island, where at one time resided a flower garden inhabited by three Goddesses of beauty named Maia, Celaeno, and Asterope. However, the island was invaded by a Gorgon and her followers. The Goddesses entrusted the Twelve Constellations to the residents of the flower garden, but they were found by the Gorgon and their hearts were turned evil.

The sorrowful voices of the Goddesses reached Zeus in the world of the heaven, and his tears became rain that wetted the ground. Zeus called the Hero Perseus, and a sacred shield and sword were bestowed on him by the Goddess of Wisdom Athena and the Messager God Hermes. Perseus then headed of to the southern island.

		<name>Courageous Perseus</name>
		<desc>Courageous Perseus is one of the very first Action RPGs from Japan, being released one month before Hydlide and in the same month as Falcom's Dragon Slayer. However, while the other two have spawned successful series, Courageous Perseus has been mostly forgotten.

You play as the legendary hero Perseus who sets out to an island full of mythical beasts in order to save the Pleiades Maia, Celaeno, and Asterope. Perseus starts with 2000HP, but his health is constantly being drained one point per second. Enemies are attacked simply by bumping into them while holding the Space bar pressed.

Story 

Located in the south of the ocean is an island, where at one time resided a flower garden inhabited by three Goddesses of beauty named Maia, Celaeno, and Asterope. However, the island was invaded by a Gorgon and her followers. The Goddesses entrusted the Twelve Constellations to the residents of the flower garden, but they were found by the Gorgon and their hearts were turned evil.

The sorrowful voices of the Goddesses reached Zeus in the world of the heaven, and his tears became rain that wetted the ground. Zeus called the Hero Perseus, and a sacred shield and sword were bestowed on him by the Goddess of Wisdom Athena and the Messager God Hermes. Perseus then headed of to the southern island.

There are 13 different fighter planes to fly, both Allied and German (Fokker Dr.I, Fokker Eindecker, Fokker D.VII, Albatros D.I, D.II, D.III, Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a, Airco DH.2, Sopwith Pup, Sopwith Camel, Sopwith Triplane, Nieuport Scout, SPAD VII).</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Decathlon (Japan) (Alt).rom</path>
		<name>Decathlon</name>
		<desc>Decathlon is a 1-2 player sports game combining ten athletics track and field events.
The game can be played as single events or in a full 10 event competition against the computer or/and a human opponent.

The competing events in the game are the normal: 100m sprint race, 400m dash, 1500m run,
110m hurdles, long jump, high jump, pole vault, shot put, discus throw and javelin throw.

Players can select their country (and the opponents) from eight predefined: UK, France, Germany, Austria, USA, Canada, Japan, Taiwan.
The competitors names are not changeable, e.g. 'Tommy' will always compete for the UK.

Only two players (human or computer) compete against each other in every event, so even if in the 1500m run four characters are running on the track; the two extras are just filling out the field, creating a tripping hazard for the two actual competitors.

Each character has a stamina/power that affects his performance, so the player has to keep within the avatars limits, or he gets too tired.

After a single race, the player gets the option of trying again, or ending the event.

In a full decathlon, a points table is filled in as the events progress.</desc>

		<name>Deep Dungeon II</name>
		<desc>YÅ«shi no MonshÅ is the sequel to Deep Dungeon: MadÅ Senki. Hundreds of years have passed, the spirit of the long forgotten evil Emperor Ruu has returned. A hero claiming to be the descendant of the previous hero Raru appears in the town of Dorl, and sets on exploring a tower in order to defeat Ruu.

The game consists of an eight level tower, four of which are underground, while the others are above ground, the underground levels having a higher difficulty than the latter. The game plays like its predecessor, the player exploring the tower in a first-person view, fighting monsters and improving the hero's skills along the way. When the hero levels up, he gains points to be attributed to his different stats rather than having them distributed automatically. When the hero's level is significantly higher than that of the monsters on the level, random battles are suspended; only the battles triggered by stepping on specific spaces have to be fought. The game has two endings, one being a secret good ending.</desc>

		<desc>Once upon a time, a demon called Sharudo came to Fairy's land, creating havoc. He built a monster town on a mountain top and dwelled there, ruling over the land below. One day, Sharudo came and took princess Chris to his monster lair. Now it's up to Ares, a brave soldier in the service of the Fairies, to save Chris.

Demon Crystal is an action puzzle game. Scattered around the stage are numerous keys which help open locked areas. The goal is to find the big key which is needed to open the exit and advance to the next stage. Ares' only weapon is a limited number of bombs, which explode in a flame and can kill multiple enemies at once. The game consists of 30 stages (houses).</desc>

Door Door is a platform game in which Chun has to lock up the alien creatures that pursue him. Chun can attempt to lock as many aliens as he can behind each door that is available on a particular stage. Chun can slide open a door, wait for the alien(s) to enter and then he has to quickly shut the door, because if he waits to long the captured aliens will walk out and pursue him again. Each stage is completed when all the enemy aliens are trapped behind doors.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon</name>
		<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.

The NES version of this game also has an additional VS. fighting mode for one or two players. Players choose from a field of six different characters (Billy and 5 of the enemy characters) and enter into a one-on-one fighting match. Players have to punch, kick, jumpkick, and even use a weapon against their opponents until someone's health bar is fully drained. The winner is the last one standing.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Dragon Slayer (Japan).rom</path>
		<name>Dragon Slayer</name>
		<desc>Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG genre. The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and "bump" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.
The player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Dragon Slayer II - Xanadu (Japan).rom</path>
		<name>Dragon Slayer 2 - Xanadu</name>
		<desc>Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China. The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.

Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply "bumping" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.

Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.

Money can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a "karma" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many "good" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Dragon Slayer IV - Drasle Family (Japan).rom</path>
		<name>Dragon Slayer 4 - Drasle Family</name>
		<desc>Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.
The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.

The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-restoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</desc>

		<desc>This game exists in two editions, one for the MSX1 and one for the MSX2 with better graphics.

In Romancia: Dragon Slayer Jr., you are a young warrior whom the king sends on a mission to rescue a lost princess. You must leave the town and enter the dreadful monster-infested catacombs in order to complete your quest.

The game is a departure from Dragon Slayer RPG-oriented gameplay style. It tends more towards medieval-themed platformer action. The hero has hit points, can buy items and weapons, use magic, and stay in inns to recover health. However, instead of receiving experience points and becoming stronger, you simply must attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump higher.</desc>

		<desc>Dungeon Master is a role-playing game where the player selects four adventurers and descend into the depths of the dungeon.  The gameplay is reminiscent of the 3D dungeon crawl type of role-playing games popularized by Wizardry and The Bard's Tale.  However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.</desc>

What this game makes different from many other shooters is that before you can shoot the aliens you have to get your space craft airborne and it must be in air before the end of the runway!
Once airborne, you can shoot all aliens. But remember, there is only a limited supply of fuel on board! You must shoot all aliens before you run out of fuel.
After you've shot all aliens you have to get your space craft back on the ground to refuel for another mission.</desc>

		<name>Eggerland Mystery</name>
		<desc>The Eggerland series consists of several puzzle games. You play Lolo, a blue ball-like character with eyes, arms, and legs. The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only colored red. It is up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him.
You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). Luckily for you Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers.
There are other types of obstacles in the levels, as well, such as water and Emerald Framers (green blocks that Lolo may push around freely).</desc>

		<desc>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.

Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: shooting them with his gun, kicking them by jumping onto them, shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them and crushing them with an elevator.

Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.</desc>

There are dozens of enemies and two types of shooting: slow and fast. Two weapon systems: one slow double-shot cannon and one fast single-shot cannon.
With each enemy hit by the slow cannon you get one shot added to the fast cannon ammunition supply.
A challenge stage follows each stage in which you can build up your fast-shot bullet supply.</desc>

		<desc>F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1 is a top down Formula One Racing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released for the MSX in Japan and Europe in 1987. The game engine is very similar to Konami's Road Fighter. It also features Konami's custom sound chip called Konami SCC (a five-channel chip that compliments the three-channel PSG chip of the MSX computer system, or in other words, a sound custom chip that brings five voices more to the three voices of the PSG sound chip on the system), and great MSX1 graphics to go with it. It was one of the first ROM on MSX with this sound feature. Together with its "3D" spinoff (F-1 Spirit: 3D Special), F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1 was the most extended racing game Konami released for the MSX.</desc>

You will need to take the form of a dolphin and a bird in order to locate the pieces that are hidden in the ocean and clouds. When flying in the air, there are several screens that have clouds flying by. Touch all of the clouds, and the trident piece appears! Other birds which are flying around will cause you to lose energy if you touch them accidentally. Underwater, trident pieces can be found by touching the sea horses. Octopuses, sharks, and a deadly maze of seaweed will get in your way and cause you to lose energy if caught! When you have located all of the trident pieces, the cage holding Neptina can be unlocked, but if you run out of energy first the game will be over.</desc>

The goal of the game seems to be to stop some kind of missile attack. At the beginning of the game you need to select two members of your team, out of five options available. Statistics of these members are presented during the opening credits of the game.

The gameplay is sluggish, and your team members take a fixed formation which is actually a hindrance to get past obstacles as they will not get out of formation and prevent you from moving forward. The enemies seem to be being spawned at random, as such it is critical to keep moving forward as fast as possible avoiding them as much as you can.</desc>

You have to pick up the mice and bring them safely to the left side of the building where the steel fire escape stairs are located.
When all the mice have left the building trough the emergency exit at the bottom-right of the screen it is your turn to leave the building by using the stairs that appear randomly on the lowest platform level.
You progress to the next level when you have left the building.

The shape of the platform changes each level and also fire balls will appear making it more difficult to you to rescue the mice. When a fire burns too long on a particular part of floor that floor will disappear and don't get caught by the fire or you'll lose a life.</desc>

		<name>Fire Rescue</name>
		<desc>In this platform game you control a mouse who is a fire fighter and that has to rescue mice out of an burning apartment building.

You have to pick up the mice and bring them safely to the left side of the building where the steel fire escape stairs are located.
When all the mice have left the building trough the emergency exit at the bottom-right of the screen it is your turn to leave the building by using the stairs that appear randomly on the lowest platform level.
You progress to the next level when you have left the building.

The shape of the platform changes each level and also fire balls will appear making it more difficult to you to rescue the mice. When a fire burns too long on a particular part of floor that floor will disappear and don't get caught by the fire or you'll lose a life.</desc>

Red Stones are placed in key locations across the levels.  They can be pushed, stacked on top of each other, and even destroyed.  Flappy must strategically take advantage of the gravity and the Red Stones in order to clear the path for pushing the Blue Stone.  Three different types of enemies will try to prevent Flappy from clearing the level, so you must either avoid the enemies, crush them from above with the Stones, or pick up Sleeping Mushrooms to knock them out temporarily.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Flash Point (Korea) (Unl) (Alt).rom</path>
		<name>Flashpoint</name>
		<desc>Flash Point is inspired by the arcade game Robotron. The story is that an alien fleet landed in the capital city of the United World Nations and the player has to defend it for as long as possible using a tank.

The gameplay is divided in two main screens. The first screen is the city map, which shows the areas being attacked by the aliens as flashing points (hence the game's name). The areas will flash faster as time passes by, until they are completely destroyed or until the player moves to that area to defend it. Once the player reaches one of those areas, the game changes to the second screen, which shows the tank in the center of a green park area, with buildings around it. There are several aliens in this area, which will start homing the player, destroying the terrain in their way. The player has to destroy them as quick as possible, trying to save as much terrain (specially the central green area) as possible for a higher score. Once all aliens are destroyed, the player is sent back to the map screen to select another area. Moving in the map screen is faster on streets, slower on other ground types.

The tank is controlled using both joysticks, one for movement and one for shooting in all eight possible directions. The game was released with a frame to hold both joysticks together. The player has 3 lives and one extra life is earned for each 30,000 points scored. The game has also a high score table.</desc>

		<name>Flicky</name>
		<desc>The premise of Flicky is dramatically simple: the chick has to face a succession of fixed boards (which form an infinite loop around themselves) full of platforms. The other inhabitants of the board are a variable number of tiny chicks, a kitten called Tiger and an iguana called Iggy. The objective is of course to collect all the chicks and get them to the exit while avoiding Tiger and Iggy. Once taken under your wing, the chicks will follow you in single file. If Tiger or Iggy manage to hit one of the chicks, it will stop following you and you will have to retrieve it. If the two predators catch Flicky, they eat him, simple as that. The only way Flicky can get rid of his feline and reptilian pursuers is by picking up certain items lying around the levels and sending them into Tiger's vibrissae or Iggy's scales.</desc>

		<name>Les Flics</name>
		<desc>Les Flics (French slang for the police) is a game inspired by the movie and cartoon character The Pink Panther. With Unspecteur Cleudeau and Gend'armerie Kaolin on his heels, the player's task is to steal a priceless gemstone known as the Purple Puma.

The game starts out on the streets of a city with nine interconnected buildings. The player has to drive his car to the different buildings while avoiding the police cars that are chasing him. Upon entering one of the buildings the game switches to a side view perspective of a single screen platform stage. Each stage consists of five levels of platforms and the player uses staircases, lifts and firemen's poles to move between them. In the buildings are various objects that the player has to pick up since they are needed to steal the gemstone. There are nine items in total and it's up to the player to figure out what they do. At the same time the player has to watch out for the guards that try to stop him.</desc>

		<name>Flight Simulator with Torpedo Attack</name>
		<desc>The conception of the Flight Simulator computer game series, still going strong today, began in the late 1970's with "FS1", created by Bruce Artwick of subLOGIC and released in early 1980.  First came the Apple ][, with a very scaled down instrument panel on bottom and outside/radar view on top, then the TRS-80, with mere 128x48 monochrome graphics and thus numbers and bars replacing the panel.  

There was only one aircraft and one region: a 6x6 grid with "mountains".  The user could press "W" and "declare war", entering the WW1 "British Ace" game mode.  The objective was to shoot down enemy planes and bomb their base.

Both the Apple ][ and TRS-80 versions originally came on cassette tape.  The Apple ][ version was updated in 1981 with minor improvements.

Note that the first PC version, Microsoft Flight Simulator (v1.0), was released two years later and is more similar to the 8-bit versions of Flight Simulator II.</desc>

		<name>Frogger</name>
		<desc>Your task in this arcade game is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away from their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<name>Frontline</name>
		<desc>Front Line is a vertically scrolling action game. Your mission is to infiltrate enemy territory and destroy their fortress. To reach the fortress, you will have to make your way through varied and dangerous terrain. Jungles, deserts, brush, and rocks all slow your progress, plus each area has numerous enemy fighters and tanks trying to stop you. To help get past these obstacles, you are armed with a machine gun and grenades; at some points in the game you may even come across an abandoned tank which you can control to increase your odds of survival. When you reach the end of the level and successfully destroy the fortress, the game will repeat at a higher level of difficulty. Gameplay is for one or two players, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>

		<desc>Galaga is a vertical arcade shooter from Namco.  You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen, scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and to fire your own missiles to fight back!

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</desc>

		<name>Aoki Ōkami to Shiroki Mejika : Genghis Khan</name>
		<desc>Genghis Khan is a top-down 2D turn-based grand strategy game, based on the real mongol leader Genghis Khan's life.

The game's main objective is to become the supreme ruler. The player can select from two campaigns: Mongol conquest or World conquest. In the Mongol conquest, players take on the role as Temujin (later known as Genghis Khan), with the goal being to unite all the tribes of Mongolia. In the World conquest, Players can be one of four characters. Similar to the Mongol conquest, players must unite all the countries together. Players can use military force (players must gather an army and lead them into war) or use diplomacy (including things such as strategic marriages). 

The main focus of the game involves management of territory, as the player manages various activities that improve their provinces. Battlefields are hex tiled based, with players giving commands to units groups with the objective of  trying to defeat the forces of the enemy combatants.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Ghostbusters (Europe).rom</path>
		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1984 film of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call to "bust" any ghost hauntings. They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated "proton packs" and "ghost traps", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the "PK level" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for "ghost alarms", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).

As the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

Each room is one screen in size and are viewed from the side. Controls are simple with only two keys used to move the glider: backward and forward. Since the airplane naturally seeks the floor it is necessary to use the wind coming from floor vents to gain height. Obstacles that have to be avoided include tables, candles and electrical outlets. Good items to touch are clocks which give points and sheets of paper which give extra gliders. If touching any obstacles the glider is lost. The number of gliders available is by default four but can be set from one to six.</desc>

		<desc>Once the player gets past the title screen, the game will begin. The movement of Godzilla is in three dimensions, and Godzilla's only weapon is his atomic breath, which can be aimed. Godzilla has four lives, which are depleted by either the enemies touching Godzilla, hitting Godzilla with their attacks, or Godzilla falling into a hole.

Megalon will dig holes in the ground and come up to the surface to get Godzilla. After defeating Megalon, Kumongas will come up from the holes and fire at Godzilla with one of two weapons; a string shot or a color-changing projectile. After defeating several Kumongas, King Ghidorah appears and Godzilla has to defend Minilla. King Ghidorah shoots his gravity beams near himself, and if Minilla touches King Ghidorah, Godzilla loses a life. After defeating Ghidorah, the game restarts.

The 2-Player mode is the same as the one player mode except that two players can alternate between each life, each with their own lives and score meters. (godzilla.wikia.com)</desc>

		<name>Gradius</name>
		<desc>Nemesis is the first entry in the long-running Gradius series on the Game Boy. Its side-scrolling shoot'em up gameplay follows the series template closely. Players control the Vic Viper through five levels, most based on levels in earlier entries, for a kind of 'greatest hits' of the series. There is a cave level (as in level 1 of the original Gradius), the mandatory Moai stage, a Gigeresque organic level, a graveyard (similar to bonus stages in the MSX and PC Engine version of the original Gradius) and a high-tech base. Besides the classic core ship in the first level, all boss enemies are entirely new.

The cycling Gradius power-up system is reused here: collected power ups advance the power meter which can be activated at any time to gain the highlighted item. The line-up includes the classic selection of speedups, missiles, dual shots, lasers, option satellites and forcefields.

The game allows players to start in any of the five levels and even to set the number of lives to a maximum of 99.</desc>

Like it's predecessor, you can collect power up from enemies and chose which ones to use when. This time, this system is enhanced because you can chose between 4 different power-up sequences, allowing you to use differents types of weapons against your enemies. There is also the possibility to gain options, which are mysterious balls of fire that follows your spaceship closely and mimic all its movements (including shots). While you only could have 2 of them in Gradius, you now can have up to 4 of them.</desc>

		<name>Guardic</name>
		<desc>Guardic is a top-down 2d shooter based on the classic premise of pitting a single starfighter against a horde of enemies with the fate of the galaxy at hand. A particularly interesting touch in Guardic is that instead of fighting through a scrolling field filled with enemies, the game places your ship in "rooms" with a fixed amount of opponents that take up the most part of the screen. After defeating every enemy on screen you advance to the next room and so on... Power ups are not activated until you reach the next room (with some exceptions) and even then you have to choose which ones to activate before you enter the fight, which gives the game an additional strategic touch.</desc>

		<desc>Guardic is a top-down 2d shooter based on the classic premise of pitting a single starfighter against a horde of enemies with the fate of the galaxy at hand. A particularly interesting touch in Guardic is that instead of fighting through a scrolling field filled with enemies, the game places your ship in "rooms" with a fixed amount of opponents that take up the most part of the screen. After defeating every enemy on screen you advance to the next room and so on...

		<path>./No-Intro/Gulkave (Japan) (Alt).rom</path>
		<name>Gulkave</name>
		<desc>Deviating slightly from Compile's usual vertically scrolling fashion, Gulkave is a rather orthodox horizontal shooter. Flying across ? or inside ? a parallax scrolling landscape, your spaceship must singlehandedly take out eight fortresses. In your way stand enemy spaceships that either try to crush you or fire at you, as well as some asteroids thrown in for good measure. For each hit you take, your ship is not destroyed. Instead, you have a power (barrier) bar that decreases gradually until you finally lose a ship. At the end of each level, bonus points are given according to your remaining barrier. Losing a ship means you lose all your weapons upgrades as well. As usual with a shooter from this maker, the powerups come in the shape of numbered pods that are released from Zanac-style blocks. Different upgrades give higher shot counts, more simultaneous bullets or bigger energy waves. At certain score intervals, you're granted bonus ships.

The game was released for both the MSX and Sega's SG-1000 console, the latter version having two levels less.</desc>

		<name>Gunfright</name>
		<desc>The player takes the part of the "meanest and fastest Gun Totin'Bunch of Rootin' Tootin' Gun Slingers which ever did hit the Wild West", Sheriff Quickdraw. In the beginning of the game in a first person view the player has to be quick on the draw to shoot bags of money that fall down the screen, to collect a "bounty" that will be used to buy supplies and cover possible fines during the game.

The main game then takes place in an isometric scrolling play-field that is similar to previous Ultimate Filmation titles. The objective is to collect a bounty by finding and eliminating wanted criminals that are harassing the town. Innocent bystanders will point to the direction of the criminal, shooting them will result in a fine reducing your score. A horse can be obtained to speed up the chase. Once the wanted criminal is encountered, the game again switches to a first person cross hair view, where the first to draw will be the winner. Taking out the criminal will give you a reward that helps you with future expenditures as the cost of ammo and horses changes as the game goes along. Your final tally will become your score at the game's end.</desc>

		<desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

		<desc>In Miracle Warriors: Seal of the Dark Lord, you have been asked to recover the Golden Seal which is being guarded by the Dark Lord Terarin.  You start your quest by yourself, but you must find three other companions who will join you to defeat Terarin. You also must venture through five lands. You will find villages, towns and castles in your travels in these lands. In each, you will find or be able to buy weapons and armor (both for you and your companions), medicine and clues. You will also find caves, dungeons, and monuments that are scattered. Some you may enter unhindered. Others will be locked until you find the right person or learn the right spell. 

Also within each land, you will encounter monsters such as evil merchants, Weasly wimps, Unmutaks, Great Lions, Gelfises, Zirods, and many more. Some of these monsters do less damage than others, and  take more damage themselves. You can either attack them yourself using your weapons or spells, or make your companions attack the monsters themselves. When defeated, most monsters will either leave behind some coins, which you can spend to buy stuff at the towns, or some items, which you can also use to defeat monsters.

However, not all inhabitants are monsters. You will also meet merchants and travelers who might tell you where to go and what to do.</desc>

		<desc>This is the second golf game from HAL Laboratory after Hole in One. Like it's predecessor, Hole in One Professional is a standard 18-hole golf game, played from a top-down perspective. Players can compete in stroke play with up to four players, or match play against a friend or the computer. When playing against the computer, the player will play against an opponent that uses metal clubs, which hit farther than the standard wooden clubs.

In addition to stroke and match play, players can obtain passwords that allow a replay of any spectacular shots that are made (eagles, holes-in-one, and double-eagles).</desc>

		<name>Hustle Chumy</name>
		<desc>You are Chumy, the mouse. You live in the sewer, and you are hungry. Luckily, the sewer is filled with cheese, only it is guarded by menacing creatures such as rabbits, turtles and bats.

In order to get his cheese, Chumy must go between platforms connected by ladders, all the time avoiding the other creatures. Luckily, Chumy can jump very far, across and above the nasties. Chumy also has an arsenal of cans to throw at the enemies. Most die after just one hit, whereas others are more impervious to attacks. The rabbits are particularly dangerous, since they may pounce at you unexpectedly, they being able to jump just as far as Chumy. When Chumy eats cheese (or bombs or biscuits), he moves slower due to the extra weight. When the mouse has fed on all the cheese, it can take the dust chute down from the top level to the bottom, and make its way to the exit and on to the next level. Control Chumy with the cursor keys and X for jumping, C for throwing.

This game has also been included, in a slightly revised form, on Compile's Disk Station #0.</desc>

		<name>Hydlide</name>
		<desc>An evil demon named Varalys casts a curse upon the princess Ann, turning her into three fairies. You control Sir Jim and set out to find the fairies, and then slay Varalys.  Only by vanquishing Varalys can the curse be lifted. Once the princess is restored the kingdom will be saved.

Hydlide is an action game with strong role-playing elements. The player has to explore vast wilderness areas, descending into dungeons and eliminating enemies on the way. Combat system is similar to the one implemented in Ys series: attacking enemies requires the player to "bump" into them, at the same time preventing them from attacking the playable character from the sides and the back. The player can change between defensive and offensive stances by pressing a single button. Magic spells can also be used to dispose of the enemies. The player character grows stronger and gains better parameters as he advances in the game.</desc>

		<name>Hydlide III - The Space Memories</name>
		<desc>The third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply "bumping" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.</desc>

		<desc>Hydlide II: Shine Of Darkness is an action RPG, and the second installment in the Hydlide series. In a different space a wonderful world existed, called Fairy Land, which was dominated by swords and magic after the times of domination by monsters and evil had ended. The people of Fairy Land were intoxicated with peace. At that time an incident occurred. A Consciousness filled with evil awoke and it created new monsters, brought the dead back to life, and wanted to dominate Fairy Land again. The monks were one of the first who noticed this and warned the people about it but they didn't listen and left the monks disappointed. The monks prayed to God and asked Him if there was a Savior.</desc>

		<name>Hyper Olympic 1</name>
		<desc>Track &amp; Field is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. Events include the 100 meter dash, the hammer throw, the javelin throw, the long jump, the high jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

		<desc>The greatest athletes from around the world have gathered for the grandest sporting spectacle since the golden age of Greece. This pressure-packed competition is as fierce as a starved lion. Surviving is a matter of sweat and concentration in Taekwondo, pole vaulting, canoeing, skeet shooting, hammer throwing, high diving, archery, hurdles, gymnastics, hang gliding, pistol firing, arm wrestling, fencing, triple jumping and swimming... Whew! Wears you out just to read them all. The odds in Vegas say you don't have enough strength, stamina or skill, but you know better. And as long as you win, you're the crowd favorite. But lose, and you might as well turn in your jockstrap and joystick.</desc>

		<desc>Six tough events await in this joystick-waggling successor to Track &amp;Field.

The full sequence of events is - swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery, triple jumping and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.

Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round, they will have to qualify by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum targets.</desc>

		<name>Jump</name>
		<desc>This arcade game is a cross between Breakout and Space Invaders. Player controls an electromechanical robot, who walks along the top of a wall consisting of bricks and jumps on it. A line of bugs is coming to him from the bottom of the screen in vertical direction, while the bomb is flying in horizontal direction in the center. Bugs may be killed by jumping on the wall, which results in a brick falling from its bottom. The number of jumps is equal to the bottom brick's distance from the robot. Flying bomb may eliminate the brick until it reaches the bug, but if the bug is killed, its bad or good soul will fly to the top, where robot may collect it and make influence on his mood. After the bug is eliminated, another one will start to crawl from the bottom. There is a snail moving in horizontal direction at the very bottom of the screen, which is mostly covered by the bugs crawling to the top, and it may be hit by brick in case of success also. 

The player is transferred to another level after necessary quantity of the bugs is killed. But beware! Robot's energy is exhausted, when bug is crawling upon him, and the robot becomes non-functional if the bugs reached the very top of the screen or if the robot falls off the wall.</desc>

		<desc>You play Kage, a skillful ninja in search of rescuing Princess Kiri from the hands of the warlord Yoshi. Armed only with a sword and 'star knives', you must fight your way through countless henchmen and the occasional boss to complete your task. Levels include the forest, moat, inside and outside of the castle. These levels repeat as the seasons change. The gameplay is side scrolling. Kage's moves include the ability jump extremely high in the air, grab and climb trees, block and attack with his sword, and throw shuriken. The game can be challenging at times though because the player dies in one hit. 2-players are supported, but must take turns.(Moby Game)</desc>

		<name>Karuizawa Yūkai Annai</name>
		<desc>A girl named Kumiko is spending a vacation with her younger sister Nagisa in Karuizawa, a popular tourist destination in Japan. The vacation turns into nightmare when Nagisa doesn't return home from the local supermarket. Kumiko receives a strange phone call later that evening, and decides to call the police. However, the authorities seem unable to solve the mystery, and Kumiko's boyfriend decides to conduct the investigation by himself. Karuizawa Yūkai Annai is an adventure game that relies on exploration and information-gathering rather than on puzzle-solving. Individual locations are displayed as still screens viewed from first-person perspective; however, the player can also navigate the protagonist on a top-down map. The player is presented with a large menu of commands, which are for the most part identical on every screen. Some of these commands can be combined with objects chosen from a menu.</desc>

Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</desc>

		<name>King's Knight</name>
		<desc>King's Knight is a fantasy-themed top-down shooter where four heroes have to unite to defeat a dragon and rescue a princess in despair. It was one of the first games published by Square Soft (now one-half of Square Enix). King's Knight is a variation on Konami's Knightmare which sold extremely well.

The first four stages involve you powering up your characters as far as they can go, picking up shields (to increase defense), boots (to increase speed), swords (to increase attack power), and spell icons (which will be required to be held by everyone for the final storm on the castle), defeating monsters along the way. The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. Nearly everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:

Ray Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power; Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping; Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly.

It is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage, because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the party members has died.</desc>

		<name>King's Knight</name>
		<desc>King's Knight is a fantasy-themed top-down shooter where four heroes have to unite to defeat a dragon and rescue a princess in despair. It was one of the first games published by Square Soft (now one-half of Square Enix). King's Knight is a variation on Konami's Knightmare which sold extremely well.

The first four stages involve you powering up your characters as far as they can go, picking up shields (to increase defense), boots (to increase speed), swords (to increase attack power), and spell icons (which will be required to be held by everyone for the final storm on the castle), defeating monsters along the way. The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. Nearly everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:

Ray Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power; Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping; Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly.

It is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage, because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the party members has died.</desc>

The pyramids on earth are malfunctioning devices of alien origin with enough energy to destroy earth. And it's up to Vick to switch off the core functions of El GizaThe game consists of six pyramids each with its own wall engravings and color pattern; every pyramid contains 10 levels. The idea of the game is to collect crystals called soul stones in each level by solving the different puzzles and evading or killing the enemies using the many tools and weapons available to unlock the exit door that will take you to the next level.King's Valley II: The Seal of El Giza is an Action game, published by Konami, which was released in Europe in 1988.</desc>

		<desc>Our hero must reach Melkhior, a somewhat eccentric wizard who is the only one who can save him. As with most Ultimate titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise navigation. 

The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later Head Over Heels, using monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instructions in favor of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.</desc>

		<name>Knightmare II - The Maze of Galious</name>
		<desc>Knightmare 2:Maze of Galious/Majou Densetsu 2:Daimashikyou Galious is a 
Japanese game which was released back in 1987 for MSX. It is a sequel to Knightmare. I've never played Knightmare 1 before. All I know is that it is a shooter type of game in which you play as 
Popolon who tried to rescue his wife Aphrodite from a villain named Hudnos. The
sequel takes place right after you rescued Aphrodite.  Now you play as both 
Popolon and Aphrodite, who will try to to rescue their future baby kidnapped 
by a dark priest named Galious. The gameplay is a mix between action and RPG.
You have the side-scrolling actions throughout six worlds and yet at the same
time there are some RPG elements included such as having to find certain items
to complete certain tasks. Maze of Galious stays true to its name with its huge
and sometimes confusing maze-like worlds to be explored.Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.</desc>

		<name>Knightmare III - Shalom</name>
		<desc>In this game, you play the role of a Japanese high-school student, the leader of computer club. Above all, you like playing games. One day, you and your girlfriend are playing a game and suddenly get teleported into the game world. This is a fantasy world that resembles ancient Greek civilization. Before long you realize that you are in fact a hero who must save this world from the evil Gog, an ancient demon awaiting resurrection, otherwise you won't ever be able to return home.

Shalom is the third entry in Konami's Knightmare series. Unlike the previous games, it is much less heavy on action and is structured primarily like an adventure game with emphasis on interaction with characters and exploration. You navigate your hero through a large top-down world, interacting with characters along the way. The interaction is done via a command menu with verbs such as "Look", "Talk", "Take", etc. From time to time you'll have to fight enemies. The battles take place on a separate screen, and you attack the enemy with your weapons in real time.</desc>

		<desc>A boxing game with a couple of moves, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard.
Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down. There is a referee. The game has a two player option.</desc>

To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.</desc>

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.</desc>

The game uses the usual "striped grass" effect to simulate speed. Push up on the joystick to accelerate, but don't drive too fast in the curves, or you will drive off the road and the car will flip over.</desc>

		<name>Legendly Knight</name>
		<desc>Once there was only one continent in the world. It was populated by magicians. At first they lived in peace, using magic to make the land prosper. But soon they were divided into two groups: good and evil. The forces of vice were strong, and the benevolent magicians need the help of a lone warrior to venture into the castle of the evil magicians and defeat them.

Legendly Knight is a Korean-made action game with platforming elements. The game consists of single-screen stages, most of which contain platform structures. The player-controlled knight can jump and attack enemies. The goal is to kill all the enemies on the screen, including bosses which are fought one-on-one.

The knight has a health bar measured by hearts. He is armed with a small sword in the beginning, but later can find throwing weapons and magic spells. Items include armor, a scuba suit, health-restoring potions, and a ring that grants temporary invincibility. Keys must be obtained in order to access the boss room. All these items are invisible, and their exact location must be revealed by attacking spots in the stage. It is possible to find and equip glasses that would show the exact location of the keys.</desc>

		<desc>Once there was only one continent in the world. It was populated by magicians. At first they lived in peace, using magic to make the land prosper. But soon they were divided into two groups: good and evil. The forces of vice were strong, and the benevolent magicians need the help of a lone warrior to venture into the castle of the evil magicians and defeat them.

Legendly Knight is a Korean-made action game with platforming elements. The game consists of single-screen stages, most of which contain platform structures. The player-controlled knight can jump and attack enemies. The goal is to kill all the enemies on the screen, including bosses which are fought one-on-one.

The knight has a health bar measured by hearts. He is armed with a small sword in the beginning, but later can find throwing weapons and magic spells. Items include armor, a scuba suit, health-restoring potions, and a ring that grants temporary invincibility. Keys must be obtained in order to access the boss room. All these items are invisible, and their exact location must be revealed by attacking spots in the stage. It is possible to find and equip glasses that would show the exact location of the keys.</desc>

		<desc>The aim of the game is to guide a ball through 50 levels of walls, barriers and general obstacles. You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings.

There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random.

The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.(Moby Ganes)</desc>

		<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

		<desc>Another arcade classic finds a new form in 3D! And this time it's Lode Runner...

Lode Runner 2 is the sequel to the remake of Doug Smith's timeless classic. The game features 5 unique worlds where in each level you will try to collect all the gold without dying. Run, dig, climb, scale, fall, drob bombs and collect stuff! 

Like in Jazz Jackrabbit 2, this sequel has also added a companion (Jane) to its main character (Jake Peril). They are identical in their capabilities --no special moves. Choose one of them and get into Lode Runner's new dimension!</desc>

Speed and maneuverability are lower in Gerwalk mode, which can be useful for getting through tight spots. In Battroid mode, the Valkyrie's projectiles are self-seeking. Only in Fighter and Gerwalk modes, the Valkyrie can launch a powerful missile spread that can take out a lot of enemies at once. The spread is limited to three firings per wave, though.</desc>

		<name>Chess Master</name>
		<desc>The ancient game of chess is recreated here, with all the traditional rules and game concepts. The game is in 2D, as the programmers felt this was the most effective use of available memory. Controls involve moving a pointer over the square to move a piece from, pressing space, then moving to the destination square and pressing space again. You can set the amount of time players (human and computer) have to plan moves, although an over-ride option to force a move instantly also exists. You can save and reload games, and at any point can move pieces either from current settings or from scratch, to completely customise the game or play out classic positions.</desc>

		<desc>The Eggerland series consists of several puzzle games. This game is a sequel to Eggerland Mystery. Again you play Lolo, a blue ball-like character with eyes, arms, and legs. The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only she is red. Again it's up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him. You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). All the rooms are connected but not all the room entrances or exits are closed.
To fight the monsters Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers. There are numerous types of obstacles in the rooms. Emerald Framers are green blocks that Lolo may push around freely. To make it all more challenging there are also numerous terrain obstacles, like water, sand and grass which have all different drawbacks for Lolo.</desc>

		<desc>In Midnight Building you control a man who is running around in a dark labyrinth. You'll start at floor eight and work all the way down to floor one.

At the beginning of each round the labyrinth floor is shortly visible, giving you the opportunity to locate the keys and the vault in the labyrinth. After a few seconds the labyrinth turns black. Only your direct surroundings of the labyrinth lightened.

Now it becomes your goal to collect all the keys, open the vault with the collected keys and then return to the middle of the labyrinth to enter the door and go to the next floor.

There are at least three hostile green men running around in the labyrinth who are trying to catch you. You'll loose a life when they catch you.</desc>

Using joystick or cursor keys, a white dot representing the club is moved around a black dot representing the ball. This indicates angle, and the distance from the ball sets the putting force. Putting the ball in the hole in as few strokes as possible is your objective: less than 8 strokes gives higher scores and more than 12 strokes yields no points at all.</desc>

AKA: Secret Treasure of Moai

In The Secret Treasure Of Moai your goal is to reach the level exit at the top by climbing and destroying the rock structures before you run out of time or got caught by enemies.

The rocks can be destroyed with the hammer that you carry. When destroying rock formations you might find special items and you should collect these or otherwise you might end up being unable to reach the level exit. You also won't reach the end of the level if you destroy the wrong rock structures or destroy them in the wrong order. As you progress in the game the puzzles to reach the exit become more challenging.

The game contains bonus stages in which you have to collect as much diamonds as you can within the time limit. (Moby Games)</desc>

		<desc>Mole is a whack-a-mole type of game where the objective is to hit on the head of colored moles as they emerge from 8 holes situated in cardinal and ordinal directions from the center of the field. However, the color of the mallet changes frequently and the player has to respond to it because hitting a mole of the same color as the mallet will result in decrease of the score bar. If the player is unable to fill the score in time (indicated by a timer bar), the game is lost. There are 9 difficulty levels, with higher difficulty featuring more frequent appearance of moles of the same color as the mallet, thus requiring more attention of the player.</desc>

		<desc>The follow-up to Mole Mole plays exactly like the original, which means that it is very close to Boulder Dash but at a slower pace, since each move requires planning, whereas falling boulders won't kill you. Three difficulty levels are on offer: Selections, Children and Experts. Your mole, while digging tunnels in the earth to collect each and every item on-screen before proceeding to the exit, can neither jump nor dig upwards, which is what makes careful planning of your tunnels necessary. To your aid, you have a map screen which shows the entire level in a zoomed-out format. The same screen is also used for the built-in level editor.</desc>

Some monkeys are minding their own business when they see a number missing from their arithmetic problem. Who took it? Another monkey, a crab? And where could it be? The only way to find that out is to go looking for it.

Guide your monkey across the screen and up and down platform levels. Watch out for the crab! If its claws bite you, you lose a monkey. Jump up and pull down shades to find the missing number. When you find it, catch the number bar. Then send it up to your helper monkey. Find three missing numbers and earn bonus points!</desc>

		<desc>This platform game is about solving arithmetic problems. In the equation one number is missing, you 'll have to find the right number. This game is aimed at young children to help them learn arithmetic problem solving or playing with numbers.

Some monkeys are minding their own business when they see a number missing from their arithmetic problem. Who took it? Another monkey, a crab? And where could it be? The only way to find that out is to go looking for it.

Guide your monkey across the screen and up and down platform levels. Watch out for the crab! If its claws bite you, you lose a monkey. Jump up and pull down shades to find the missing number. When you find it, catch the number bar. Then send it up to your helper monkey. Find three missing numbers and earn bonus points!</desc>

		<name>Moon Patrol</name>
		<desc>Moon Patrol is a side-scrolling game where the player must drive a moon buggy from one station on the Moon to another, all while avoiding crashing or getting destroyed by alien ships. The vehicle is constantly moving right and the player can speed up or slow down, jump, and shoot (simultaneously firing upwards and forwards.) There are 25 checkpoints along the way, each symbolized with a letter from A to Z, and serving as a respawn point. Every five checkpoints mark a separate "stage" within the entire course; reaching the end of a stage under the par time grants a large score bonus. 

Dangers on the Moon include rocks (small and big ones) which can be shot to pieces or jumped over, pits which must be jumped, and UFO's which fire at the player or bombard the ground (creating pits). Later the player also comes upon stationary tanks which fire missiles (that can be destroyed with the player's own shots), landmines, carnivorous plants that pop up out of pits, and rocket cars which stalk the buggy from behind before rushing forward in an attempt to ram it down. 

After completing the first course (the "Beginner Course") the player can try his skill on the harder Champion Course.</desc>

		<name>Moonsweeper</name>
		<desc>In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

Each stage consists of three levels with seven poles on each level, and Mr. Chin must demonstrate his acrobatic skills by spinning dishes on all of the poles at once. An unappreciative critic tries to thwart Mr.Chin by throwing cutlery at him from off-stage which he must avoid by either jumping or ducking. The frequency at which these objects are thrown increases for later stages. From stage 4, gaps in the floor appear and move about which will cause the circus star to fall. From stage 10, the levels wrap back to the beginning.</desc>

Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Do! vs Unicorns</name>
		<desc>Mr. Do! vs Unicorns (AKA Mr. Do!'s Castle) is an action platform game which has you in a castle consisting of several floors, each of which contain a variety of blocks. You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles.

There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life.

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous. (Moby Games)</desc>

		<name>Gradius</name>
		<desc>Nemesis is the first entry in the long-running Gradius series on the Game Boy. Its side-scrolling shoot'em up gameplay follows the series template closely. Players control the Vic Viper through five levels, most based on levels in earlier entries, for a kind of 'greatest hits' of the series. There is a cave level (as in level 1 of the original Gradius), the mandatory Moai stage, a Gigeresque organic level, a graveyard (similar to bonus stages in the MSX and PC Engine version of the original Gradius) and a high-tech base. Besides the classic core ship in the first level, all boss enemies are entirely new.

The cycling Gradius power-up system is reused here: collected power ups advance the power meter which can be activated at any time to gain the highlighted item. The line-up includes the classic selection of speedups, missiles, dual shots, lasers, option satellites and forcefields.

The game allows players to start in any of the five levels and even to set the number of lives to a maximum of 99.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Night Shade (Japan).rom</path>
		<name>Nightshade</name>
		<desc>Between the Seas of the Seven Islands and the purple Mountains lies a valley. Time was that this area was safe and hospitable, however darkness then came - killing many of the inhabitants and warping the minds of the others. Many have gone there, none have returned - can you be the first?

Nightshade is an arcade adventure in scrolling isometric 3D (an advance on earlier Ultimate titles such as Knight Lore, which were flick-screen), with directional or rotational controls. You can take 3 hits from the various roaming monsters - turning from white to yellow to green as you take them - but a 4th costs you one of your five lives. Objects can be thrown at these foes, but only if you have any.

The map is made up of medieval-style buildings, which are visible while you are on the outside but whose roofs lift when you enter them, to ensure full visibility. There are four super-villains to destroy (a mad monk, a skeleton, a ghost, and Mr Grimreaper), and you must find the right objects to do this.(Moby Games)</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Ninja Jajamaru-kun (Japan).rom</path>
		<name>Ninja Jaja Maru Kun</name>
		<desc>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. 

Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.

In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.

As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.

Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.

The items in this game are:Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.

Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!

Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.

Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.

Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.
Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!

Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.

Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.</desc>

		<name>Nobunaga no Yabou 2 - Zenkokuban</name>
		<desc>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</desc>

		<desc>Othello is a conversion of the board game. Each player tries to fill the game board with as many discs of his color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the board by selecting a location where the  opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The trapped discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out, and the player with the greatest number of his color discs on the board wins. Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<name>Pachicom</name>
		<desc>Pachicom is a pachinko game simulation. Pachinko can be described as a game that is a cross between pinball and a slot machine. This game comes with two different game modes to play. Game A lets the player play until they attain a score of at least 3000. The goal is to achieve this score as fast they possibly can. Though, the game can still end prematurely by running out of balls to shoot. Game B lets the player try to get as high of a score as possible, but with an added time limit.

The game contains over 200 different board layouts to choose from. At the main menu, just choosing Game A or B will randomly assign a board for the player to play on, while choosing Select A or B will let the player select their own board of choice to play on.

The gameplay is mainly passive. Players can only adjust the shooting pressure knob which effects the speed and location of where the balls will land.(Moby Games)</desc>

		<name>Parodius : Tako ga chikyuu o sukuu</name>
		<desc>The first title in the Parodius series, although it is often confused with its sequel Parodius! From Myth to Laughter. The name itself is a portmanteau of "Gradius" and "Parody" and, eponymously, the game is a parody of the Gradius series of space-based horizontally scrolling shooters. Many of the characters and enemies are derived from that famous shooter series, while other elements are extracted from other Konami titles, such as Antarctic Adventure and TwinBee. This game is of particular note in the series as being heavily infused with Japanese culture and folklore.
The gameplay is very similar to the Gradius games, with other aspects from games such as TwinBee. However, the characters are replaced with silly characters taken from either these or other Konami games as well as Japanese culture. The music is mostly taken from classical music pieces.

The player can play as either Takosuke, an octopus, the Penguin (father of Pentarou) from Antarctic Adventure and the exclusive MSX game Penguin Adventure, Goemon from the Ganbare Goemon series, the Popolon knight from the MSX game Knightmare or the Vic Viper spaceship from Gradius. The game is composed of six stages consisting of various obstacles and enemies such as penguins and bees, as well as more traditional Gradius enemies such as moai. As with Gradius, the game utilizes a similar selection-bar based power-up system.</desc>

		<name>Pastfinder</name>
		<desc>Pastfinder is a vertically scrolling action game which takes place in the year 8878. You are a member of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. 

At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.

Finally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.

The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points.</desc>

		<name>Pegasus</name>
		<desc>In this game, an evil demon called Satan has spread chaos in the world, and someone has to stop him. This is where you come in. 
Playing as the hero Perseus, you have to go to 5 different worlds, each with its own theme, and kill Satan's guardians (end of level bosses). 
A friendly wizard has also given you a magical flying horse called Pegasus, to help you in your quest.

Each world has 10 levels, and half of them are played flying on Pegasus back, and the other half walking, without your magical horse. When flying, the game plays like a Shoot'em up, but when walking, it's a platform game, and you have to rely on your sword.

You can buy weapon upgrades and other bonuses, if you collect enough diamonds. They can be found spread out all over the levels, and fallen enemies drop them sometimes as well. If your health drops too low, you can also heal yourself by spending some diamonds.

After every world, you get a password, letting you continue from the same place the next time you play. That's fortunate, because this game takes a long time to complete.</desc>

		<desc>Pico Pico is primarily an action game set on a single screen which shows a top-down view of you and your "house". This is a loose collection of bricks that can be shifted by pushing them or firing into them. Suck spiders start invading from the edge of your property, and you must shoot them before they shoot you. The spider's dead bodies can provide extra material for your house. After the first wave of 30 spiders has been killed, your bride arrives, and you receive bonus points for the size of your house. The next wave of spiders then arrives, but now you must also protect your wife. This can be done by surrounding her with bricks, dead spiders, and "stoppers" which you can drop in an empty space in front of you. If you or your wife get shot, you lose a life. After every 30 spiders killed, you receive a bonus, as well as a small amount of time to prepare for the next wave.</desc>

Pippols is a vertically scrolling shooter in which you take control of a lad who navigates what seems to be a garden and shoots hearts at enemies. The screen is divided into five vertical paths by rows of flowers (or other shrubbery and obstacles in later stages). Within the path the protagonist can move freely up and down, but to change the path he needs to jump left or right if there is an opening. You can collect coins and various power-ups as you go. At the end of a stage you can choose one of the branching paths to advance to a different stage.</desc>

		<desc>You are Pippols, a brave boy, who is seeking the Holy Gem to bring back light to the world. Watch out as the fairies of darkness will try to stop you in your journey across the various countries of the world of Magic.

Pippols is a vertically scrolling shooter in which you take control of a lad who navigates what seems to be a garden and shoots hearts at enemies. The screen is divided into five vertical paths by rows of flowers (or other shrubbery and obstacles in later stages). Within the path the protagonist can move freely up and down, but to change the path he needs to jump left or right if there is an opening. You can collect coins and various power-ups as you go. At the end of a stage you can choose one of the branching paths to advance to a different stage.</desc>

With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</desc>

		<name>Konami's Pooyan</name>
		<desc>In Pooyan, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>

		<name>Puzzle Panic</name>
		<desc>Puzzle Panic is a 1984 puzzle game created by Ken Uston in collaboration with designers Ron Karr, Bob Polin, and Paul Wernick. Ken Uston was better known as a blackjack player and strategist, but he was also a video game author and the creator of Puzzle Panic. The game was originally released on the Commodore 64 and Atari 400/800 in 1984, but later received an MSX port in 1986 by SystemSoft.

Puzzle Panic is more of a minigame compilation than a defined puzzle game. There are eleven different "levels" that can be played, each of which is somehow a pattern based short puzzle game. These range from collecting certain items in a specific order, to reaching a set point under certain conditions.

The player begins the game in a room filled with question marks. There are two doors available, and walking into each one teleports the player to a new game (while the other brings the player to a new room, with two different doors; essentially a hub world). Within these games, there are several modes of difficulty to play through (accessed through three different doors within each game) before moving onto a different screen. All of the games can be accessed at anytime by bringing up the menu (by pressing F2).

When the games are played in order rather than by the menu selection, they are (in reality) part of a larger puzzle, where each puzzle is actually represented by its own symbol, and interaction with the gates at the end of each is integral. In fact, the final puzzle requires the player to select the symbol that represents each level, as well as the order they were played in sequence. The final puzzle was known as "Metasequence," Ken Uston's "ultimate challenge." This larger puzzle was originally intended to be part of a real life contest, where players who managed to complete the puzzle in time (by August 31, 1984) won a trip to Atlantic City with Ken Uston.(Giant Bomb)</desc>

The gameplay is still focused on forming lines of blocks that match a target color, while enemies constantly enter the playfield. However there are now many different layouts in 50 different stages. Also added are differently colored blobs that function as power-ups when touched. Blue ones for example grant invincibility.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/R-Type (Japan) (Alt 2).rom</path>
		<name>R-Type</name>
		<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

There are some "puzzles" in the game where you have to figure out how to get across to a certain area without putting yourself in fatal danger. You fight riflemen, archers, snakes, and other baddies. A few different endings are offered in this game depending on how you choose to rescue the girl, the best ending - being able to escape with the girl safely.</desc>

		<desc>Relics is an action-adventure game where players take the role of a spirit who can possess different characters. The spirit appears at underwater ruins with no explanation why it became a spirit and what it needs to do. In fact, one will only find out about the story of the game when seeing the real ending. The graphic style of the game is compared to the works of H. R. Giger.

Players can possess other bodies after killing their owners, but to get the real ending, they must explore the ruins while avoiding unnecessary combat by running away or ignoring the characters they meet on their way. There is no music in the game apart from the opening and the real ending and, depending on the body possessed, players will acquire different skills and attacks.</desc>

		<name>Rise Out from Dungeons</name>
		<desc>Rise Out From Dungeons is a platform game where you must guide an unnamed character through 20 dungeons avoiding traps and red-colored men. The graphics and game mechanics are strikingly similar to Lode Runner, but with a twist.

As in Lode Runner, you must collect several objects all over the level while avoiding red-colored men, there are many stairs and gaps where you fall down if you are not careful. If you fall in the water, you die. You can also destroy blocks by shooting them with your gun. Curiously enough, the "red men" can't be defeated by your gun, and they will follow you everywhere you go, only to respawn if they reach a point where there's no way out. There are some elements which look like ropes but they are in fact just a special kind of platform: you can always walk across them safely, but if you land on them after falling down, you will just fall through them, so they actually work as traps. Other game elements include a hidden key used to open a door which leads to the stair leading out from the dungeon.

The objective in each dungeon is simply to "rise out" from them, and that can be done by climbing a stair which passes through the dungeon ceiling.</desc>

Six robots from six countries fight in a tournament that, apart from the robot element, is closer to American, Mexican or Japanese wrestling than the classic kind of wrestling. Each player uses three keys or buttons to execute various attacks in the classic "button masher" beat'em'up manner, with different button combinations triggering different techniques according to the proximity between the combatants. Each robot has its own arsenal of special moves. The ring is viewed from an elevated position and allows movement in two dimensions. The losing robot is turned into scrap ready for recycling, with the winner going on the next round.</desc>

Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action packed shooter based on the arcade game. There are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian.

		<name>Sasa</name>
		<desc>This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. 

The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.</desc>

		<name>Sewer Sam</name>
		<desc>It's a lovely day and Sam is waiting in Central Park to meet his girlfriend Sally. He sees her and walks to her. He only has eyes for her and before he realizes it he finds himself in the New York sewer system.

Three Russian submarines have been located in the New York sewer system and they have blocked off the system.
Sam's only way out of the sewer system is to destroy the Russian submarines. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.
Sam can't go back... once he's gone through the City Sewer Department seals the tunnel. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.

The sewer system has three types of sewer tunnels. Tunnels with solid dry floors, tunnels with a water passage in the middle and tunnels with pits. 
Sam can walk, run and creep through the tunnels but Sam can't move as quickly in water.
Sam can move from tunnel to tunnel by entering one of the passages that appear occasionally on his way.
Each time he enters a new sewer, Sam receives a fresh supply of oxygen.

On it's way through the sewer system Sam is under attack by nasties like rats, bats, spiders and more.
The ultimate nasties are the Russian submarines. They are located only in water canals. The status bar at the top of the screen contains a distance indicator. It tells you how far Sam has traveled into the sewer. If it's red, it means there's a dreaded submarine at the end of the sewer.
The more nasty elements you shoot, the higher you'll score.</desc>

		<name>Shindobaddo Nanatsu no Bouken</name>
		<desc>As Sinbad the pirate, you have not been successful recently, and there is mutiny brewing among your crew. The only way to appease them is to find your father?s buried treasure, hidden underground on Corinthia. Trogs and Soldier Ants heavily guard the island, but you have your trusty sword to help. Make sure your food and water levels stay high enough by regularly checking your status.

Viewed from a first-person view, Sinbad must navigate the building in single steps, moving in the current direction or rotating each time. Each of the 54 rooms has a pattern on its door giving some idea of its function. Some are empty, but many contain either objects or hazards (though there is no clue as to whether it is an object or a hazard). Objects include a Compass, a Bag of Gold Coins, a Treasure Chest, and the Magic Lamp, and are automatically collected. The hazards are either a magnet (damaging your compass), Trogs (who are defeated by checking the letter on its shield and pressing the appropriate letter key to jab him with the sword). Soldier Ants are scared into submission (using your torch) in the same way, but they will still lurk menacingly. The third type of room is a Clue Room, which requires the Magic Lamp, and sees you gain a hint from the Wizard.

There are six skill levels ? not only do they increase the number of Trogs and Ants, they also change the letter you must press to defeat them. The position in the alphabet of the killing key is the value of the letter displayed, plus the skill level (so if you see H on level 3, press K, for example.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Slapshot (Spain).rom</path>
		<name>Slapshot</name>
		<desc>Slapshot is an aggressive online street roller-blade hockey game without any principles and rules on the rink. Each game-player logs in and tries to raise his/her level as much as he/she can, playing numerous matches, winning the money, raising their stats, and buying equipment and skills.

There are three kinds of hockey players: Defender, Centre Forward, and Wing Forward. Each of them may be male or female, and they differ by stats. Defender is strong, but slow, while Wing Forward is fast, but not strong. There are 13 stats for each player, which may be raised with level increases and/or with clothes worn or items used.

There are three stages of the game:

1) Tutorial;

2) 1-5 Levels; 

3) 6-50 Levels

During Tutorial stage, you'll learn basic techniques and some tricks available with certain levels.

During 1-5 Levels stage, you may play in 2 kinds of matches:2 human players versus 2 bots
2 human players versus 2 human players

It is a stage to increase your level to 6th, and the ability to earn money if you run out of such on the third stage.

During 6-50 Levels stage, you may play in 3 kinds of matches:1 human player versus 1 human player
2 human players versus 2 human players
3 human players versus 3 human players

It is a stage to increase your level to maximal and become the legend of Slapshot.

Each player may create the room for the rink, adjust its theme, invite others, dismiss unwanted players, protect the room with a password, etc. Winning the money, you as a player may spend it on clothes, which increase your stats, or items such as clubs. Money also may be spent on the skills, which you'll use during gameplay by pressing combination of keys defined for such skill. To master the skill, you may practice in a separate rink.

The hockey gameplay itself is in 3rd person view, while you move your player with arrow keys, and use defined keys to hit the puck, hit the opponent, steal the puck, speed up, use command options, ask a team player for a pass, give a pass  to team player, get ready for a strong hit before a pass, etc. Additional skills allow you to hit the puck sliding left/right, turning in 360 degrees, get out from opponents, hit the puck sliding around the gates, etc. Animation sequences are shown using the game engine, when the match starts, finishes or somebody scores.

During each match some players may have some additional missions (for example to interrupt the pass for 2 times), which gives more money on accomplishment. Tactical and technical actions are calculated for each player during the match and their number and quality influences on experience player gains after the match's end.

Chatting before, after and during the game is possible and allows to understand the desires and mood of each game participant.</desc>

		<name>Space Camp</name>
		<desc>Based on a special effects movie, Space Camp takes place in space (it says so in big letters on the cover). You guide your spaceship through orbit, avoiding meteor showers, military satellites and other obstacles. The control method is much like "lunar lander" type games, but in zero gravity, so a quick thrust with the engines will move the ship indefinitely. Since you have limited oxygen and energy reserves, you must pick up oxygen bottles and energy canisters from the space stations you fly past.

After the vertically scrolling space sequence, you jump out the ship and explore a space station. The control method is the same, and like before, you must keep an eye on oxygen and energy. Apart from said resources, the space stations have hidden treasures hidden below certain panels. Find treasure by gliding across the panels and pushing the joystick button. Certain panels will lead you to hidden treasure chambers. All the while, you must watch out for the space station's guardian, which moves in your direction when you activate your thrusters or press the button. As long as you just glide, the guardian stays put.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Space Invaders (Japan).rom</path>
		<name>Space Invaders</name>
		<desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see Battlezone  and Asteroids).  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

		<name>Space Maze Attack</name>
		<desc>Space Maze Attack is a top-down shooter in which the player navigates a white spaceship in search of treasure through claustrophobic mazes that are infested with hostile aliens. The spacecraft is equipped with a simple peashooter and has limited energy. When the energy runs out, the spaceship explodes. Upon finding a treasure, the unused energy is converted to points and a new level starts. There is also a 2-player mode where two people can take turns in order to find out who can amass the highest score.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Space Trouble (Japan).rom</path>
		<name>Space Trouble</name>
		<desc>On the surface, Space Trouble looks like an orthodox shooter, but it has an unorthodox twist: Don't shoot! You navigate your ship through an asteroid field, with a finite fuel supply. From time to time, enemy ships come into view and try to hunt you down. Shoot them down, but bear in mind that each shot costs a little bit of fuel. Sometimes, you will encounter a fuel supply, and strewn throughout the game are powerups which boost your "flight record", which is turned to score as you complete a level. As the game progresses, the asteroids change into other obstacles, such as flying saucers, mines and organic blobs which take several shots to kill. Each enemy ship also has its own movement patterns, some hunting you down, some avoiding your shots, and some just bumbling straight forward. 

When you've passed four different fields, you encounter a mother ship. Docking with the ship requires minute precision, or you will crash and die. The ship teleports you to the next level, which is much like the first.</desc>

This time, instead of the four items which allow you to leave for the airport, the spies must try to collect three pieces of a missile and escape from the island in a waiting submarine before a volcano erupts. There are a few pitfalls to avoid such as quicksand and sharks. There are also new traps (hidden pits, napalm, snares and a pistol) and hand-to-hand combat is done with swords instead of clubs.

There are seven difficulty levels which affect how much time will elapse before the volcano erupts and the size of the playing area.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Star Command (Japan).rom</path>
		<name>Star Command</name>
		<desc>Star Command is a sci-fi role-playing game set in a vast fictional universe and featuring tactical space and squad-level combat, similar to SSI's Pool of Radiance released the same year and other games of the Gold Box series. The game has nothing to do with Star Command Deluxe or Star Command: Revolution.

The game plays in a distant future. Earth is a distant memory, having been destroyed long ago. The small human population is concentrated in a small portion of the galaxy, called "The Triangle" due to its form, and threatened from its neighbors: The Alpha border is plagued by pirates, recently united under a certain "Blackbeard", the Beta border is frequently ambushed by an intelligent insect-like alien race who is thought to plan an all-out war. The third border leads to largely unknown territory with space-faring robots of unclear origin. The only hope for mankind is the Star Command, the headquarter of military forces. You control a spaceship crew, trying to secure peace by completing missions issued by Star Command.

The game starts at Startport Luna, where you first will have to assemble and equip your crew and buy a starship before rushing out saving humanity. Assembling the crew, i.e. character generation, is quite detailed and done by first recruiting and then training characters. Each character has seven basic stats like Strength and Intelligence. If the stats look okay, you select one of four classes (Pilots for flying ships and communicating with aliens, Marines for espionage, Soldiers for fighting, and finally Espers with strange psi powers). The character now has to be trained for eight years; each year, you select a skill to be trained, and, if you're lucky, the character increases his skill -- he may also learn nothing. Skills can be trained more than once, increasing the effective skill level. All in all, there are 18 skills, with a different set available for each class. Some trainings does not improve skills, but basic stats -- Special Forces, for example, increases speed and accuracy.

Character usually start out as Privates, but they the rank can be increased by going to Officer's school. There are 13 ranks up to Grand Admiral, with increasing pay -- money is sparse, so this may be a good choice. Then again, it may be not. Later in the game, with enough funds, you can create clones of your character to replace him when he dies. Character also age during play.

After you have created your crew, it's time to spend your money. First of all, you need a spaceship -- there are nine different ships, with different attributes like armor or fuel capacity. The ship may be upgraded by several systems, including from engines, guns, shields, drop ships, computers, etc. Finally, you have to equip your crew, again choosing among a vast selection of armor, weapons and miscellaneous items. Having a fully equipped crew at your disposal, you're now ready to get some mission from the Space Command and launch your ship.

While in space, you are shown a view of the environment, with commands at the bottom and the crew or ship status on the right. The galaxy is quite big, consisting of 32x32 sectors, each containing several systems, with each one having up to 10 planets. You can select the view, changing from Galaxy Scan (showing the whole galaxy) to Long Range Scan (showing 8x8 sectors) to Sector Scan (all systems and starports of a sector) to System Scan (the star and its planets) to Visual Scan (direct view of a planet, starport or space station with its statistics).

While travelling through space, you may encounter ships. The game then switches to turn-based tactical combat -- but that may include peaceful interaction. In each turn, you first have a selection of communication strategies -- bargain, plead, ask, demand, even impersonate a deity are possible. Then you can move and rotate your ship, and finally, you can fire. Some situations, for example when you're boarding an enemy ship or while travelling on land, you can engage in squad combat, which closely resembles spaceship combat, but is influenced gravity, atmosphere and terrain.

One some missions, you will have to explore underground complexes, which may contains traps and other specials events. There are 17 missions all in all, but they have no time limit, so you can do other things -- and you should, like trying to get some cash. Additionally, some missions are randomly generated, so each game differs somewhat. Character get training after each completed mission, but they can also pay for it, which is very expensive.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Star Trap (Japan).rom</path>
		<name>Sutaa Torappu. Star Trap</name>
		<desc>Year is 2189, humanity has visited numerous galaxies due to the hyper-space engines. In search of adventure and exotics of the distant lands you have signed contract for 5 years with the Intergalactic Company to work on the Space Lines. For your first trip you were appointed as technician trainee on the freighter AMPELOS. The freighter left Achernar VI in direction of Tau Ceti II. Some hours later you were in the room of piloting when suddenly all alarms start... What is that? You have only 8 hours to discover it.

You start to explore the freighter AMPELOS. Robots became uncontrollable and attack you. They are surely behind the commander's death. Happily, the computer can help you to deactivate them. But your adventure is only beginning and already the cap of the dead commander (peace to his soul) reveal a number, which you remembers quickly.

The gameplay flows as the icon-based first-person adventure. You may move in available directions and do the actions via set of  icons, which are "Take", "Put", "Look at", "Examine", "Use", and some new such as "Listen", "Recharge" (a battery, a weapon). Another icon allows you to start a dialogue, for example, with the navigator or the doctor. You can then ask them simple questions from predefined words such as "HOW TO DEACTIVATE ROBOTS?" and you'll hear the words pronounced. At the right side of the screen you'll see the objects in your possessions and useful information: health, fatigue, your ammunition, your reservation of air (if you are wearing a combine suit). When you arrive in a place, you should use the icon to look at the place (the eye), sometimes several times to discover objects. Then (and before taking the object) you should use the magnifier on the object, because it can't be used on the object already put in inventory. 

Amstrad CPC version of the game is port of Atari ST version and use only 4 colours.</desc>

The factory, where robots are produced, has been taken over by aliens and they are reprogramming the robots to take over planet Earth.

To take over control of the factory, the protagonist has to reach the central Control Room; but to get there he has to overcome many obstacles and collect several objects. These objects can be used to perform several tasks of which some must be done before the player takes over the computer by stopping it. Fuel and patches for the suit can be picked up and retrieve items such as rings and spanners, which are given out by robots or just left around on the floor. The game has an option to save and load the current game status.</desc>

		<desc>The third entry in Zemina's unlicensed conversions of early Super Mario Bros. games differs from its predecessors by having its own levels. While the two first games imported levels of their correspondent Mario counterparts, Super Boy III does not copy the stages of Super Mario Bros 3.. Instead, it utilizes elements from previous Mario games as well as Super Mario World, from where some enemies and level design ingredients are borrowed.

Unlike those two games, however, Super Boy III  has completely linear levels that must be traversed in a particular order. There are no special levels such as castles, no familiar bonuses, and no power-ups besides those that were introduced in the first Mario game. Mario also walks and runs significantly slower than in Nintendo games. At the end of each stage Mario has to defeat a Hammer Brother.</desc>

		<desc>Super Boy I is a Korean-made unlicensed conversion of Super Mario Bros.. It imports the sprites of Mario and all of the enemies, terrain ingredients, as well as basic gameplay mechanics. The levels resemble those of the original game, most notably the earlier ones; however, only outdoor areas and simplified castles (some without any enemies except Bowser) are included. The game ends after three worlds, each divided into three stages and a castle level.

This version omits much of the material found in Super Mario Bros.. There are no power-ups except the mushroom (which is placed randomly); no warp points; no bonus levels; no cave or underwater areas. Falling platforms replace elevators; pipes cannot be entered. Castles can be completed without defeating the guarding Bowsers. In the castle's final area the player is greeted by the words "Sorry Nothing". The princess is not mentioned at all.</desc>

		<desc>Super Cobra is a side-scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

		<name>L.3.W</name>
		<desc>Super Columns is an updated version of Columns with more options of play, but with the same setup, maneuvering falling blocks into groups of three or more to eliminate them from the screen.  Along with a Versus mode there is also a Story mode as well.

An evil sorcerer by the name of Surhand has stolen a mystical amulet which brings peace and serenity to the land of Phoenicia and hopes to use it to bring death and destruction to the land.  The player must battle their way through his four guards in a series of best two-out-of-three games of Columns in order to face off against Surhand and bring peace back to the land.

The Flash Mode also returns to this version as well as the new Endless Mode where the main objective is to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out.  There are also special columns throughout these modes such as Glitter Columns which eliminates all blocks of the same color on the screen at once as well as Stone Block Columns which can only be eliminated through magic power-ups that can be obtained by eliminating the base blocks.</desc>

		<name>Super Golf</name>
		<desc>Super Golf is an overhead golf game with one complete course of 18 holes. The controls follow the traditional two-click system: the power of the hit and the swerve are determined after pressing a button twice with the correct timing. The used club and the basic direction is set before the hit. Together with the used golfer's talents (putting, power, accuracy and luck) this is used to calculate the result of the hit. There are always four athletes competing; either human or AI controlled.</desc>

		<name>Super Pierrot</name>
		<desc>This game is the sequel to Mr. Do's Wild Ride and the fourth title in the "Mr. Do!" series. You control Mr. Do, a clown, and guide him trough a field with varying elevation levels, with balls placed on it. You must collect those balls to replenish your weapon, a ball that you throw at your enemies. A trail (shown as a line) follows you while moving around. The area you moved turns gray and will be uncovered. All the balls in that gray area turn into cherries. And, if you do the same with the cherries, they will be upgraded to oranges. The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can be used for the "EXTRA" at the top of the screen. When any of the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" are collected an army of enemies that follows you show up and one of those enemies holds the letter that you touched.
To obtain the letter you must kill that enemy. Now you can collect the other letters. When you obtained all the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" you will receive a bonus.
On the field are logs, which can be unleashed by walking next to the side that is propped up. The log rolls down and kills all enemies it rolls over. But be careful! It can kill you too! To continue to the next round, you can kill all enemies or collect all the balls or fruits.</desc>

		<desc>In Tank Battalion, you control a tank in a maze. One after another, enemy tanks enter the maze, and you must shoot them all before they reach and destroy your base. The maze walls can be shot and destroyed. After all white tanks are destroyed, you proceed to the next level. Each level layout calls for different tactics, depending on the formations of the walls. Some spots on certain levels make for perfect ambush tactics, on other levels you must rally back and forth to eradicate the enemy tanks. Occasionally a red tank appears, shoot it for bonus points.</desc>

You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.</desc>

		<name>Topple Zip</name>
		<desc>Topple Zip is a vertically scrolling shooter that is marketed as a racing game. The basic premise is that you control an aircraft and fly in competition against several other, computer controlled crafts. In addition to shooting at your opponents, you may ram into them, and they into you. Doing so may dislodge a pill shaped power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect. 

Power-ups exist in various types, including defensive and offensive such as giving you better weapons. There are eight different levels, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other levels. How the levels connect is random each time you play the game. 

The goal of the game is to locate a key which is necessary to access the warp which leads to the eight and final level. Collect it from whichever level it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth level before any of your competitors.</desc>

		<name>Track &amp; Field 1</name>
		<desc>Track &amp; Field is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. Events include the 100 meter dash, the hammer throw, the javelin throw, the long jump, the high jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

You must travel in your turboat along a river infested with enemy patrol boats which shoot at you. Unlike the above-mentioned games, you can turn your boat with a fair amount of precision. This is absolutely necessary in order to avoid the enemy shots which come not only from ships, but from turrets on the shore as well. You must also avoid contact with ground, such as the small islands which float in the river. Luckily, you can shoot back at the enemy, but don't forget to look where you're going!</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Turmoil (Japan) (Alt).rom</path>
		<name>Turmoil</name>
		<desc>Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of ?Turmoil? is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.

The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds.  The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.
 
When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens.  There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</desc>

		<name>Twin Bee</name>
		<desc>TwinBee is a vertical scrolling shooter. The players control cartoon-like spacecrafts with anthropomorphic arms, player one being TwinBee and player two being WinBee. The spacecrafts can be moved in all 8 directions, with one button for regular shooting flying enemies and one button for dropping ground bombs.

Power-ups in the form of bells can be collected by shooting clouds. The color of the bell will change if it is shot by the player, assuming one of the possible colors:

    Yellow: grants bonus points;
    White: upgrades player's guns to a twin cannon;
    Blue: increases player's speed (up to five levels);
    Green: creates image copies of the craft for more firepower;
    Red: provides a shield to sustain damage.

The green and red bells cannot be combined. Alternate power ups can be collected from the ground, such as an alternate bell which upgrades the craft with a three way gun and a star which destroys all enemies on screen.

One shot in the middle section of the craft will destroy it. Shots which hit one of the craft's arms will destroy only the arm. If both arms are lost, the craft won't be able to shoot bombs anymore and will have to be repaired by an ambulance.

In the two-player mode, TwinBee (cyan craft) and WinBee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join "hand-to-hand" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots.</desc>

		<name>Ultra-Man</name>
		<desc>In the future, Earth must protect itself from alien invaders, a task handled by the Science Special Search Party. However, they are not alone in this endeavor. After crashing his ship on Earth while in pursuit of the evil alien Bemular, the super-being Ultraman is here to help whenever the attacking aliens prove too much for humanity alone to handle. Standing hundreds of feet tall with incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so must defeat his foes before his power drains completely.

Based on the popular television show from 1967, Ultraman directly follows the story of its source material. Cast in the role of the titular Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original series. Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, as well as use a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game continues, different enemies may even find ways to avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only three minutes, and there are three lives and no continues.</desc>

		<desc>Vaxol is best described as a Space Harrier look-alike. You are a heavily armed robot, seen from behind running across a planet surface. Since the surface is filled with dangers in the form of rock formations and other obstacles, you can fly all over the screen as well. Waves of enemies come from afar, many of them very similar to ones known from Space Harrier. As you reach the end of the level, there is of course a giant boss to defeat. You have four weapon systems at your disposal, which are unlocked one by one by picking up bonuses laying on the ground. You start out with only one life, which makes Vaxol's task even tougher.</desc>

		<desc>Volguard is a traditional shoot-'em-up. You fly a plane over a parallax-scrolling landscape, filled with enemy installations which you must bomb. An easy task, if it weren't for the enemy attack waves. Most waves consist of planes flying in a straight line across the screen, without even shooting at you. Others bounce across the screen, and some are more dangerous, as they are flying in intricate patterns and firing multiple shot. Of course, you can fire back, but keep that at a minimum. The power bar at the bottom of the screen is depleted by your cannon, and when it has reached zero, your firing rate is very low. After a while, a route comrade will join you as a kind of power-up. When a third plane joins, you may merge your fighters into a flying robot.</desc>

		<desc>Warroid is a game that pits two players (or one player and the AI) against each other in a robot versus robot fight. The objective: shoot the enemy warroid until it has no energy left. Destroying the enemy warroid will give the player one point on the six-point scale (the player starts out with three points each). When all points are lit in the player's color, the player wins the game. Controlling the warroid is easy, since it will always point its gun towards the enemy droids. Just push the space key to shoot a lot and jump away from the line of fire. There are multiple platform-like levels for the player to fight in.

A menu (called up by pressing the escape key) will let the player customize the game so as to set handicap and the colours of the player's warroids.</desc>

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

		<name>Wrangler</name>
		<desc>Wrangler is a Spanish-made side-scrolling shooter in which the player controls a jet pilot whose mission is to protect the city from unknown enemies. The enemies' goal is to destroy the energy centers of the city, and the brave pilot must stop them at all costs. The gameplay is similar to that of Falcon Patrol: player-controlled jet moves in four directions, destroying enemies with missiles, and needs to recharge fuel and ammunition at specific points, where it becomes particularly vulnerable to enemy attacks.</desc>

The key to playing the game correctly is to properly time the missiles/torpedoes, as well as taking their trajectory into account.</desc>

The game has three stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are three distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

		<desc>Zenji is an action/strategy game where you control a rolling face throughout a maze. Each section of the maze can be rotated by the face. The goal is to turn the entire maze green by connecting each section of the maze to the source at the center of the screen. After all sections of the maze have been connected, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to having a time limit to complete your task, you need to avoid the flames and sparks which wander about the maze. From time to time a number will appear in a maze section and count down from 9 to 0. If you touch the number before it disappears, bonus points are earned. As the levels progress, the mazes become larger, trickier and more flames will appear.</desc>

		<desc>Zoom 909 (ã‚ºãƒ¼ãƒ 909) is an arcade game developed by Sega for VCO Object arcade hardware. It was released worldwide in 1982, however, after obtaining a license for Buck Rogers, western versions of the game became known as Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom. Both Zoom 909 and Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom are largely the same game minus some minor graphical differences.

Though most home ports of the game are based on Planet of Zoom, Zoom 909 was brought to the Japanese MSX in 1983 and SG-1000 in 1985. These versions take more liberties with the formula, introducing a top-down stage as level 3.</desc>
