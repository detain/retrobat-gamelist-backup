		<name>Actraiser</name>
		<desc>ActRaiser (BS) is byte-for-byte (sans header) identical to the Japanese retail version (Although it seems it's saving system is not as functional on a real hardware setup.  The player plays as "The Master," the main protagonist of the game. Although the Master is never directly controlled, the player interacts with the world by controlling an angel and an animated statue. The player plays as an angel during the simulation sequences of the game, and as the statue during the action sequences.

The overhead-view simulation mode involves protecting and guiding the Master's new civilization towards prosperity, beginning with two humans. This portion of the game requires the player to take actions that encourage the growth of the population, including road planning and using lightning, rain, sunlight, wind, and earthquakes as miracles. The Angel can interact with the monsters in the area by shooting them with arrows as well as aid the Master by indicating where to build and use miracles.

Each area has two side-scrolling action sequences, one before the building simulation and near the end. In the action sequences, the player controls a human-shaped statue brought to life by the Master. The player must jump from platform to platform while defeating monsters to accrue a score. At the end of each action sequence, the player must defeat a boss. 

Among many things, the game is recognized for its score, which was composed by Yuzo Koshiro. Its release within six months of the launch of the console demonstrated the compositional potential it represented to future projects, underscoring its ability to use and manipulate comparatively high quality samples.</desc>

		<desc>BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2 is the direct sequel to the original F-Zero game released for the Super Famicom via the Satellaview. Two versions were released - a non-SoundLink game and a SoundLink game. The original non-SoundLink version was released as BSF-Zero 2 Practice on June 1, 1997 (although the title screen remained the same). It contained the four courses first seen throughout BS F-Zero Grand Prix (a Satellaview remake of the original), along with a new course called Mute City IV. Little is known about the later SoundLink version outside of surviving videos, but it was distributed in two halves in August 1997 and had a similar announcer and redone soundtrack as the previous Satellaview entry. At least the first week rearranged a few courses, and replaced two with new locations called "Forest I" and "Forest II". Presuming no areas were repeated, this likely means the SoundLink version had twice as many courses total. In addition, it can be seen that the player cannot choose between Grand Prix and Practice modes in the SoundLink version; as it was a live broadcast, the player is forced to play each course in a timed Practice mode, and then the Grand Prix race.</desc>

		<name>BS Fuurai no Shiren: Surara wo Sukue</name>
		<desc>BS Furai no Shiren: Surara wo Sukue is a Downloadable 4-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 3 runs between April 28, 1996 and August 2, 1997. The gameplay is substantially similar to the earlier roguelike, Fushigi no Dungeon 2: Furai no Shiren, a game released for the SFC on December 1, 1995 and subsequently localized for English markets in March 2008 as Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer for the Nintendo DS. It also bears similarities to other Mystery Dungeon games including Dragon Quest Yangus, The Nightmare of Druaga, and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Like other Mystery Dungeon games, it is set in a fantasy land based on feudal Japan, and it falls into the roguelike genre. The titular hero of the game, Shiren the Wanderer, moves in a turn-based fashion through a series of maps filled with monsters, traps, and items. The maps, referred to as dungeons, take a variety of forms including traditional dungeons, caves, forests, etc. When a player is slain, he begins at the start again with stats at the base level, however he can regain items that had previously been stored a warehouse.</desc>

		<name>Ihatov Monogatari</name>
		<desc>A Satellaview port of the Super Famicom game Ihatovo Monogatari, not to be confused with its sequel BS Ihatovo Monogatari which was broadcast on the Satellaview earlier. 
Ihatovo is a magical land created by the Japanese author Kenji Miyazawa. In the game, you are a stranger who arrives at Ihatovo and has to find seven missing notebooks by Miyazawa, to complete his stories, such as for example The Fire Stone, and others.
This is an adventure game in which you can freely navigate your character through the top-down world, in a console RPG-like fashion. There are no battles in the game and also no puzzles, although at some points you'll have to collect and to use items. The game mainly progresses thanks to conversations with various characters you encounter in Ihatovo.</desc>

		<name>BS Marvelous: Camp Arnold</name>
		<desc>BS Marvelous: Camp Arnold is a Downloadable 4-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that ran between November 3, 1996 and November 29, 1996. The game was broadcast as a rerun in January, 1997. It serves as a sequel to the earlier-broadcast BS Marvelous: Time Athletics and a direct prequel to Marvelous: Mouhitotsu no Takara-jima. Aside from the other games in the Marvelous series, the gameplay of BS Marvelous: Camp Arnold is most comparable to that of Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce. Indeed, the game's engine and gameplay elements were taken directly from Kamigami no Triforce. Unlike Kamigami no Triforce, however, the themes embodied in BS Marvelous: Camp Arnold are much more down-to-earth. The game plays like a Boy Scouts-esque survival game with environmental interactions. From an overhead perspective, the player controls characters as they walk across the land. Whenever the player encounters an important object or NPC, a command window pops open to allow the player to select between several options relating to the object or NPC. These include such things as picking up objects, talking to NPCs, or reading signs, etc.</desc>

		<name>BS Super Mario Collection</name>
		<desc>BS Super Mario Collection is a remix of Super Mario Collection (the Japanese name for Super Mario All-Stars) for the Satellaview, an add-on for the Super Famicom. The game was released in four installments. As the game played, streamed audio would enhance the gameplay experience with special music and voice acting featuring Japanese celebrities. Its "companion title" is BS Super Mario USA. A Fire Flower icon represents Nae's house, which is hosted by a Satellaview Radio Personality Nae Yūki. Here, Mario can choose to activate ghost mode which allows him to become Fire Mario once he exits the level if he is Small or Super Mario. This in turn disables players from participating in rankings. A Treasure Ship icon, which is unlocked when Mario finishes all available levels in the World. Toad's House is now just a screen where the player selects the treasure chest, rather than having Mario actually walk to the chest and open it. There is a timer in the bottom left of the screen that counts down to the end of a World cycle. At the beginning of each world, there is a list of all the levels, and a picture with dialog underneath it.</desc>

		<desc>BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge is an ura- or gaiden-version of Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Satellaview system featuring graphical enhancements similar to its Super Mario All-Stars version. While the underlying gameplay itself is largely similar, some content has been rearranged and new content has been added. The game was released in four installments, in each of which the player is sent to a different SMB2 "World" to collect the Gold Mario Statues located in each level, defeat the boss, and then find and beat Wart, who can be battled in any world when going down in any vase while the player is in Subspace. The player can select the levels in any order and return to the levels as often as desired until the "episode" ends at around 50 minutes on the clock. The player starts the game as Mario, and character changing is forced in timed events. A points system was added. Points can be gained, among other things, by defeating enemies in various ways.</desc>

		<name>BS Tantei Club - Yuki ni Kieta Kako</name>
		<desc>BS Tantei Club: Yuki ni Kieta Kako (also known by the shorthand BS Tan or even B Tan) is a Downloadable 3-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 2 distinct runs between February 9, 1997 and May 3, 1997. It is a pseudo-sequel to Tantei Club: Kieta Kokeisha and is followed by Tantei Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shojo. BS Tantei Club is a detective story. The game is a text-based point-and-click-style adventure game where still images are presented to the player and the player may guide a hand-shaped icon around the screen to select objects in the image to investigate further. A number of icons in a side-bar present the player with options such as taking notes, speaking, or placing telephone calls. Similar gameplay was used in other games from the FDS era including the popular Shadowgate (1989).</desc>

		<name>BS Tantei Club - Yuki ni Kieta Kako</name>
		<desc>BS Tantei Club: Yuki ni Kieta Kako (also known by the shorthand BS Tan or even B Tan) is a Downloadable 3-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 2 distinct runs between February 9, 1997 and May 3, 1997. It is a pseudo-sequel to Tantei Club: Kieta Kokeisha and is followed by Tantei Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shojo. BS Tantei Club is a detective story. The game is a text-based point-and-click-style adventure game where still images are presented to the player and the player may guide a hand-shaped icon around the screen to select objects in the image to investigate further. A number of icons in a side-bar present the player with options such as taking notes, speaking, or placing telephone calls. Similar gameplay was used in other games from the FDS era including the popular Shadowgate (1989).</desc>

		<desc>BS The Legend of Zelda ( BS Zeruda no Densetsu) was a remake of the NES game The Legend of Zelda, released for the Satellaview attachment for the Super Famicom in Japan.
The gameplay was identical to its predecessor, but the maximum Rupees was increased to allow you more than a thousand (rather than 255 as in The Legend of Zelda), the overworld was heavily altered, and dungeons were completely different. This game was broadcasted in two versions, Map 1 and Map 2. Map 1 is sometimes referred to as a "Third Quest", in reference to The Legend of Zelda's Second Quest, and Map 2 would therefore be a Fourth Quest.
The game was divided into four weekly episodes, this is the first episode</desc>

		<desc>BS Zelda no Densetsu is a Downloadable 4-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 5 distinct runs between August 6, 1995 and January 4, 1997. A program called BS Zelda no Asobikata was also broadcast in the half-hour prior to broadcasts of BS Zelda. This program seems to have been a radio tutorial teaching players how to play BS Zelda. The gameplay draws directly from The Legend of Zelda. The plot of BS Zelda varies considerably from the plot of the original due in great part to the fact that the hero of the game is not Link (the hero of The Legend of Zelda). Instead, BS Zelda is closely associated with the story presented in the BS-X interface cartridge, with the Hero of Light actually representing the BS-X avatar according the the BS Zelda storyline. Another major factor in the plot of BS Zelda is the fact that the story is most closely related to the story given in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Both plots take up after the conclusion of Kamigami no Triforce - a fact that for Inishie no Sekiban produces one of the many plot inconsistencies/contradictions for which the series has become noted.</desc>

It is a puzzle game where the objective is to defeat different colored germs using vitamins of the same color. It is basically four in a row just like Tetris (row or column counts) or to put it another way, to defeat each germ, three halves of the same color must be next to the germ. These halves do not need to be on the same pill. The germs will multiply as the levels progress.</desc>

		<desc>Unlike the previous Dragon Slayer games, which were all side-scrolling action RPGs, The Legend of Heroes is a far more straightforward turn-based RPG of the Dragon Quest mold. It allowed for a party of up to four characters and had a few modern upgrades, such as allowing the player to distribute stats after a level up, target separate monsters and restart a battle if their party gets wiped out.

It received one direct sequel, Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes II, before the series would drop the Dragon Slayer prefix and continue as a separate Falcom property.</desc>

It was released exclusively for Nintendo's Satellaview system, which sent games to the Super Famicom via satellite signals, requiring a special adapter to receive and decode the data. This means that Dynami Tracer was never released in cartridge form, and as such, you can't purchase it anywhere, ever. The RPG aspect primarily involves your character going from star to star, interacting with the flamboyant locals and acquiring information. Every once in a while, you'll somehow get yourself involved in a race</desc>

		<desc>Elfaria II is set 100 years after the original. Pine, the hero of the original game, disappeared shortly after saving the world after venturing into a cursed forest to cleanse it of its corrupting influence. In the years since, the world has been taken over by an oppressive theocracy that supposedly acts on behalf of Pine's message. A new hero, Kiba, gets embroiled in a quest to prevent the destruction of the world. The game's combat is focused on two rows of characters: the front row can melee attack enemies while the back-row must focus on ranged attacks for damage. Combat ensues automatically, but the player can step in for certain commands like escaping from battle.</desc>

One hundred years later attacks begin taking place, supposedly by the Sinistrals.  It's up to the descendant of the hero, and his childhood friend Lufia, to form a new band of champions to save the world.
     Gameplay is fairly standard for RPGs, with turn-based battling by way of a menu of icons, and random battles.  There's also a higher-than-normal emphasis on puzzles within dungeons.</desc>

One difference is the fact that the player can pick up coins along the racetrack (which do nothing besides adding to the score).

		<desc>BS Excitebike Bun Bun Mario Stadium was the a game released in four downloadable versions on the Satellaview download service. The game is also known as Mario Excitebike. It was released for the Satellaview in 1996 only in Japan, and is the obscure sequel to the NES game Excitebike. Each version added a number of new characters, eventually adding up to six characters in all. The game plays similarly to Excitebike on the NES, although it does have a couple differences. One difference is the fact that the player can pick up coins along the racetrack (which do nothing besides adding to the score). The only other change was an added SUPER mode, which gave the player infinite boost.</desc>

		<name>F-zero</name>
		<desc>F-Zero is a futuristic racing game where the characters control flying cars and compete in an intergalactic tournament.
In total there are four characters with their own vehicle, each one having different characteristics. A race consists of giving five laps along a track, being mandatory to complete each one of them in one of the first places to avoid being disqualified. When a lap is completed the player is rewarded with a power called "Super Jet", which lasts for six seconds or so.
The objective of the game is to defeat the other characters by crossing the finish line at the end of a race, avoiding certain damage zones within the tracks. Each vehicle has its own energy meter, which works as a way of measuring the durability of the machines; this in turn decreases each time the player passes through a sandy area or collides, and energy can be recharged while driving over a pit stop.</desc>

The game focuses on the machines of real-life pachinko/pachi-slots manufacturer Yamasa, and features two of their mascots on the box art and throughout the game's user interface and menus.

As with many pachinko/pachi-slots games that are virtual facsimiles of real machines, including others in the Jissen Pachi-Slot Hisshouhou series, the game is intended to teach players how to win big at the real thing by letting them practice on virtual versions, and features a mode that offers tutorial advice on how to maximize the odds of winning on each machine.</desc>

As these games did not use the SoundLink live audio streaming technology utilized by other Satellaview games, after being downloaded, they could be played at any time after the broadcast as long as they were not deleted or overwritten.</desc>

		<name>New Yatterman - Nandai Kandai Yajirobee</name>
		<desc>New Yatterman: Nandai Kandai Yajirobee is a multiplayer-focused game for the Super Famicom that is based on the 1970s Yatterman anime franchise.

Yatterman features a team of three heroes, all called Yatterman, who attempt to beat the supervillain team Doronbo (also a group of three) to a set of skull coins which will reveal the way to a giant treasure horde. The heroes often use toys and mechs to defeat their incompetent opponents, such as the male protagonist's kendamagic.

The game is similar to First Star's Spy vs. Spy series, in that both teams are attempting to reach the treasure first. They can trip up their opponents via a number of traps, some of which have conditional uses. By burying mines and setting off missiles, the player can whittle down the health of their opponents as well as keep them off their tracks. If the two teams meet, they fight each other in a three-on-three tag team battle with the losing side taking a large hit to their health. The game can be played single-player (as either the Yatterman team or the Doronbo team) or multiplayer.</desc>

The game's story mode has the player move from character to character while cutscenes play, with some gameplay sequences to break it up. Shinbei's first sequence starts as an adventure game, and segues to a runaway horse sequence, while Rantarou and Kirimaru progress through side-scrolling levels. Rantarou can use a grappling hook to cross large gaps, while Kirimaru can climb mossy walls.</desc>

		<name>Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki</name>
		<desc>This text-based adventure (with some interesting background graphics) was originally released in Japan over the Satellaview system. The game is a spin-off from the Chrono Series, and was the precursor to Chrono Cross. It tells the story of Serge (travelling musician), Kid (thief), and Magil (wizard) as they attempt to steal the Frozen Flame from Viper Manor.  Contains multiple, often humorous endings. An interesting game for Chrono Trigger/Cross fans, as this was the game that Chrono Cross was essentially a remake of.

Gameplay is something between a standard text adventure and a Choose Your Own Adventure book.  Rather than having a full array of possible actions, players are limited to the several options it presents at any time.  With newly discovered items and information, new areas can be reached.  Occasionally battles will occur during the exploration, which are also handled by displaying several possible actions to choose between, such as "Run" or "Jump back as it swings!"</desc>

		<name>Soreyuke Ebisumaru Karakuri Meiro : Kieta Goemon no Nazo!!</name>
		<desc>A puzzle spin-off title from the Ganbare Goemon series. Goemon has been captured and his friend Ebisumaru goes out to try to find and rescue him. In order to do so, he must traverse a series of maze-like levels avoiding obstacles and enemies and get to the end zone.

The game is played from an isometric perspective from which you can get a good view of the mazes and Ebisumaru. You have no direct control of Ebisumaru per se, but instead switch special blocks around the mazes that can change Ebisumaru's direction of travel and such. You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</desc>

		<name>Space Invaders : The Original Game</name>
		<desc>A conversion of the classic arcade title, Space Invaders. This version, as part of the Arcade Classic series on Game Boy, has both 1 and 2 player modes using the usual 2 color Game Boy tones (black, grey) to re-create the addictive shooter. However, plug the cart into a Super Game Boy (an accessory of the Super Nintendo) and you have the option of playing the game in full color, with the original arcade cabinet as border art to the action while you play.

The game is very simple to play. Shoot down the incoming invaders while dodging their fire. They will advance slowly at first towards you, but the closer they come, the faster they get.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Special Tee Shot (Japan).bs</path>
		<name>Special Tee Shot</name>
		<desc>BS Special Tee Shot is a game that was planned to be released on the SNES, though eventually was just made exclusively for the Super Famicom's Satellaview service. The game was later retooled and made into the game that is known as Kirby's Dream Course. It is unknown why the game was remade to feature Kirby characters, though it's presumed that it as because Nintendo thought that the game would prove more successful with a well known brand behind it.
The Satellaview video game had unique characters rather than already developed ones. Overall, however, the player character was uninspiring as it was simply just a red sphere that bounced around. Despite the fact that the game would be remade to feature Kirby characters, there are dramatic differences between the two titles, including the overall gameplay concept and levels. For example, in this game, the goal was simply to shoot the ball in the hole, while in the Kirby game you want to crash into enemies to destroy them. However, despite this, the games still share many similarities, such as graphics and the overall way the player controls the ball.

Interestingly, Special Tee Shot was featured not only in magazines but also on the back of SNES packages as advertisements before ultimately being cancelled and brought back with Kirby characters. It should also be noted that before being titled Kirby's Dream Course, the game was officially called Kirby's Tee Shot.</desc>

The two-player mode gives each player their own screen of blocks to eliminate, and various power-ups are meant to make the game more challenging for their opponent, such as an arrow that drops the opponent's blocks down a space.</desc>

An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency.</desc>

Each Picross puzzle consists of a numbered grid of tiles which reveal a picture when correctly chiselled away. In Marios main mode, a wrong move means losing time. However, in the more difficult Wario mode, mistakes are not shown... so be careful! Also, a friend can help by joining in with a second controller.</desc>

		<name>Tenchi Souzou</name>
		<desc>In "Terranigma", you play a young boy named Ark. He has grown up in his little village, isolated from the outer world by a stream of lava, and has never seen anything else beside it. One day, he and some other boys hear mysterious voices coming from beyond a door the village elder forbade them to open. Unable to resist their curiosity, the boys open the door, and Ark finds a box with a strange creature inside. By opening the box, Ark damages the balance between two co-existing worlds, and all the village people are turned into stones. Now Ark has to embark on a dangerous journey - to find five Towers, and to seek there the answers to his questions, and to liberate his people from a terrible curse.

"Terranigma" is an action game with slight RPG elements. Ark levels up after having completed an important quest or cleared out an area. He can attack enemies with various weapons, using various techniques: pierce, leap, dash, etc. 

The game is closely connected to and often regarded as a part of a trilogy created by Enix, the first two games being Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia.</desc>

		<desc>Annie &amp; Clint, two gunslingers, arrive at Carson City and get caught up in a gunfight. It's raining bullets and there are explosions everywhere. After an intense battle they enter the saloon where they dispose of every cowboy in sight while redecorating the interior. Our heroes flee the scene by climbing on the roof, but what's that sound? ... it's a HUGE robot!
Wild Guns is a shooter with a western &amp; Sci Fi theme. Gameplay is somewhat similar to the Time Crisis &amp; House of the Dead games, with the exception that the game isn't played from a first-person perspective but from a third-person perspective. You control your on-screen character as well as the aiming crosshair. Select either Clint or Annie and shoot down tons of enemies while dodging bullets and jumping over incoming rockets.
After the Carson City level, the action continues in Desolation Canyon, an ammunition depot, a gold mine and a armored train . Finally there's a showdown with the big bad guy.</desc>
