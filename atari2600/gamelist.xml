		<desc>PEACE THROUGH SUPERIOR FIREPOWER! 

In the far future, the planet is overrun with enormous, super insects, who fiercely battle each other for survival. You've chosen a side to fight for, and the enemy has been funneled into a deep crevice, but now you're outnumbered. You put their numbers to the test. They say the meek shall inherit the Earth, but how long can you defend it?

This was originally planned to be 1 of 3 "3-D" games on Power-Play Arcade cart #1. A screenshot was shown in a catalog for Amiga's Power System, but no description was included. It was programmed by Dan McElroy and Jerry Lawson in 1983, shelved, and made available for limited release in 2010.</desc>

		<name>3-D Tic-Tac-Toe</name>
		<desc>The game is similar to the traditional game of tic-tac-toe, but is played on four 4x4 grids stacked vertically; it is basically a computerized version of the board game Qubic using traditional tic-tac-toe notation and layout. To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3Ã—3 board. The game has nine variations: it can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.</desc>

		<name>Actionauts</name>
		<desc>In 1984, Rob Fulop began work on what would be his last game for the Atari 2600, a 'robot programming' game entitled "Actionauts". Due to the market conditions for Atari 2600 cartridges at the time, Actionauts was never completed, and was not shown or released to the gaming public until 2008.
The original, seemingly simple puzzle-game challenges a single player to use the program editor to construct a sequence of commands to navigate an onscreen robot to reach the 'cheese'. It's not nearly as easy as it looks!</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Activision Decathlon, The (USA).a26</path>
		<name>The Activision Decathlon</name>
		<desc>The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 

The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.

For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.</desc>

		<name>Adventure</name>
		<desc>An evil magician has stolen the Enchanted Chalice and has hidden it somewhere in the Kingdom. The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs. 

This is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgie, the Yellow Dragon, who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.

There are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).

The Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom

Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</desc>

There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.

The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.

There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Air-Sea Battle ~ Target Fun (Japan, USA) (En) (Atari Anthology).a26</path>
		<name>Air-Sea Battle</name>
		<desc>Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game.  On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen.  The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.

In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft.  You are stationary.   Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile.  

In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above.  On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen.  Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above.  Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.
 
In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again.  This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits).  The controls are as in games 1-6.  

In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above.  Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed.  When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired.  

In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below.  The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18.  The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below.  

In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.

Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds.  (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets.  I have yet to see this happen.)  In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a computer opponent that simply constantly fires.</desc>

In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above.  On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen.  Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above.  Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.
 
In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again.  This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits).  The controls are as in games 1-6.  

In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above.  Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed.  When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired.  

In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below.  The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18.  The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below.  

In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.

Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds.  (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets.  I have yet to see this happen.)  In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a computer opponent that simply constantly fires.</desc>

		<desc>In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs). 

If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.

After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</desc>

		<name>Androman On The Moon</name>
		<desc>Androman on the Moon was one of several planned games for the unreleased Androman robot.  Although a few of the games were rumored to have been programmed, Androman on the Moon is the first one to actually surface.  Although the game itself may not look like much, one has to remember that it was only part of the package.  The real magic was with Androman himself.

So what exactly was Androman?  Androman was a small white robot that would scurry about on a floor mat while the player controlled him using the Atari 2600.  Androman also had a barcode scanner in his bottom that would read barcodes placed on the map so the 2600 (and the robot) knew where he was.  Using a combination of the joystick and barcodes, the player could guide Androman around the floor mat and play various games.  One of those games being Androman on the Moon. 

So exactly what is Androman doing on the moon?  According to programmer Michael Case, Androman is mining minerals on the moon when he is attacked by aliens (don't you hate it when that happens?).  The giant floor mat would have the locations of the mines, and the player would have to guide Androman to them.  Once Androman was over a mine, the 2600 would show the mine maze portion of the game.  In the mine maze the player has to guide Androman (shown as an X) through the maze while avoiding the alien (shown as a green face). 

Androman on the Moon is an interesting game that shows how the 2600 could be expanded and enhanced through the use of sophisticated controllers (such as robots).  Unfortunately the game market was rapidly deteriorating, and the public wasn't very receptive to new ideas, especially anything that cost extra money.  The Androman idea wouldn't be seen again until Nintendo decided to try something similar with R.O.B.  Unfortunately R.O.B. met a similar fate after only two games.</desc>

Again? Yes, again.
How does this keep happening to you?
This time, you were on a mission to

the latest monster to terrorize the land.
But as usual, somehow you got
yourself caught by his henchmen.
Luckily, the monsters aren't any smarter
this time around.
If they were any smarter, they would
have taken your sword away.
Now you must battle your way
out of the prison dungeon,
navigate your way through the land,
and find and defeat the Goblin King.
Good Luck!</desc>

		<name>Armor Ambush</name>
		<desc>Armor Ambush is a game that gives players control over tanks that battle one another over terrain that offers varying degrees of texture and traversability. Dueling tanks was a theme familiar to owners of the Atari 2600 since Combat, the game packaged with nearly every Atari 2600 system, had a very similar premise. However, Armor Ambush expands upon the simple battles available to players of Combat. The game takes place on a different randomly selected battlefield each round. Additionally, players can drop mines on the battlefield by simultaneously pressing the fire button and pulling down on the joystick. The mines remain active for the duration of the battle, destroying either tank that runs over them. Players are able to control two tanks and switch between them on command. The terrain is more diverse, featuring areas of foliage, water, and natural barriers. But as with "Combat", there is no AI for the computer, and the game cannot be played solo.</desc>

		<desc>In this two player game each player controls an artillery gun set in a mountain landscape with the goal of destroying the other player. Players take turns firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Asteroids (Japan, USA) (En).a26</path>
		<name>Asteroids</name>
		<desc>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name.

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon.  When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.

Game Difficulty and Variations
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 

The game also offers three different game variations:

1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.

2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.

3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.

Scoring
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.

1. Small saucer - 1,000 points
2. Other player's ship - 500 points
3. Large saucer - 200 points
4. Small asteroid - 100 points
5. Medium asteroid  - 50 points
6. Large asteroid - 20 points</desc>

		<name>Atari Video Cube</name>
		<desc>In this game, you control Marvin the Cube Master. You move him around a six-sided cube with nine squares to a side.
The object is to get all nine sides to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, depending on the game variation you select.

Marvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire button. Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is.

To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate.

The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves.
Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't know what color your on.
Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces.

Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.</desc>

Sounds familiar? It should. Atlantis II is an altered version of Atlantis When Imagic ran the Defend Atlantis contest, they wanted to find the top four highest-scoring players and invite them to Bermuda for a grand finale shoot-out for cash prizes. The top two-hundred fifty contestants would get snorkeling sets and the top one-thousand contestants would get t-shirts. Unfortunately, more than four people maxed out the score on Atlantis so, to break this tie, all of these maxed-out scorers were sent snorkeling sets and t-shirts as well as a modified Atlantis game called Atlantis II. The modified game is faster, scores lower per hit and the score font is different.</desc>

Bachelorette Party was just a graphic hack of Bachelor Party with the gender roles reversed. The game play was, otherwise, the same.

In Burning Desire, your girlfriend has been captured by natives and is being burnt as a sacrifice. You are hanging, naked, from a helicopter and must put the fires out by, it appears, spitting on them. You then lower your erected penis to the woman who holds on to it with her mouth while you fly her to safety. You must do this all while avoiding the rocks thrown at you. If you get hit by a rock or take to long and your girl gets roasted, you lose a life.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Backgammon (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Backgammon</name>
		<desc>This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual.

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:
All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.
No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.
A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.
After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.
If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Difficulty switches
Right:
A=computer rolls dice for you
B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers
Left:
A=computer sets up the board for you
B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

Game variations
Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player
Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player

Games one through four are backgammon
Games five through eight are acey deucey

Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.</desc>

		<name>Bank Heist</name>
		<desc>You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city) in a 1930's style car.  Your purpose is clear: perform "bank heists" by driving across white-pillared symbols that represent banks.  As you "rob" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments.  You must avoid the cops to stay alive.  Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can strategically drop to destroy the cop cars.

Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in Pac-Man), there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town.  By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city.  Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.

There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one.  Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to.  This keeps your gas supply high, and the money rolling in!  If you run out of gas, the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>A very simple math game for kids.

Each game of Basic Math gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, and inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty.  The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function.  Games 1 - 4 allow you to select one of the numbers you will be working with, while 5 - 8 give random questions.   

Hint: For division problems that have a remainder make sure to put a space between the whole number and the remainder, which goes to the right.</desc>

BASIC is an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. In conjunction with the manual, this cartridge will help you learn the beginning steps of this easy-to-learn computer language. You can create simple programs, games, and even compose your own music. Up to nine lines of code are allowed.

To simplify the input of data, BASIC Programming requires a set of special keyboard controllers that plug into both the left and right joystick ports. These keyboard controllers were included in the original packaging.</desc>

		<desc>Basketball allows you to play a game of one-on-one against either the computer or another player. The court is viewed from the side with a basket at each end of the screen.  Using the joystick you can move your player around the court, dribble/shoot the ball, and attempt to block your opponent. The game is played in two 4 minute halves, and the player who scores the most points wins. There are two different skill levels available which can be set individually for each player.</desc>

		<name>Beamrider</name>
		<desc>Beamrider is a 3-D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occassionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</desc>

The object is to stun then capture Beannies. You can also capture Bouncing Orange Eyeballs and various Falling Objects.

If an unstunned Beanny touches you, you lose a life. You don't need to stun the other items to capture them but doing so makes them slow down.

You get a bonus Bopper by shooting four Beannies in a row without losing a Bopper.

There are two game options, one where the Beannies bounce off the walls on screen, the other where they pass through.</desc>

Then you will be in the forest, where, depending on the cassette you have selected, you will have to catch the correct numbers, letters or the letters to spell a certain word.

After you catch the required items, you then move on and either have to dodge stones again or cross one or two bridges that open and close.

If you hit a stone, catch the wrong falling item or don't get across the bridge(s) in time, you get a warning sound but do not lose a life. You can play non-stop until you choose to stop.</desc>

Some minor tweaks were done like altering the color and graphics to more closely resemble the arcade version but most notable was that the arcade game voices were added in, saying things like "Intruder alert! Intruder alert!" and "Chicken, fight like a robot!".

The game play is the same. Eliminate robots on the screen. Do not touch them or the walls or you die. Do not let them shoot you. Do not linger in a maze or Evil Otto will come after you and he cannot be stopped so you would have to run.</desc>

		<name>Big Bird's Egg Catch</name>
		<desc>Big Bird wants to win the county fair egg contest and you can help him.

A chicken at the top will lay and egg and it will go down a chute. You must get Big Bird under the correct chute to catch the egg.

Game one is one player only. Games two through ten are one or two player. All games have two rounds.

Game one is a practice round. There are two chickens, straight chutes and when you move Big Bird left or right, he pops right under the chute.

Games two and three have three then four chutes and the game gets faster in the second round. Game two's chutes are straight, game three's zig-zag. Big Bird still pops under a chute.

Games four, five and six have three rounds. There will be eleven white eggs dropped and one golden egg. Games four starts with two zig-zagging chutes in the first round and four in the second. Game five has two crisscrossing chutes in the first round, four in the second. Game six has four crisscrossing chutes in both rounds. Big Bird  no longer pops under the chute but must be positioned correctly.

Games seven has eleven white eggs and one golden egg dropping per round with unlimited rounds. There are five broken eggs on the bottom left and you do rounds until you miss so many eggs you are out of broken eggs. when you catch the golden egg, in addition to points, you get an extra broken egg.

Game eight is the same as game seven except you can't see an egg in the chute, only when it pops out the bottom.

Games nine and ten are the same as game seven but the chutes shrink up in the direction of the hens. This means you must memorize when the chute comes out for which chicken. In game nine, the chutes are all the same for each round. In game ten, the patterns change per round.

Each white egg caught is worth one point, each golden egg, five.

For ages three to seven.</desc>

		<name>Big Bird's Egg Catch</name>
		<desc>Big Bird wants to win the county fair egg contest and you can help him.

A chicken at the top will lay and egg and it will go down a chute. You must get Big Bird under the correct chute to catch the egg.

Game one is one player only. Games two through ten are one or two player. All games have two rounds.

Game one is a practice round. There are two chickens, straight chutes and when you move Big Bird left or right, he pops right under the chute.

Games two and three have three then four chutes and the game gets faster in the second round. Game two's chutes are straight, game three's zig-zag. Big Bird still pops under a chute.

Games four, five and six have three rounds. There will be eleven white eggs dropped and one golden egg. Games four starts with two zig-zagging chutes in the first round and four in the second. Game five has two crisscrossing chutes in the first round, four in the second. Game six has four crisscrossing chutes in both rounds. Big Bird  no longer pops under the chute but must be positioned correctly.

Games seven has eleven white eggs and one golden egg dropping per round with unlimited rounds. There are five broken eggs on the bottom left and you do rounds until you miss so many eggs you are out of broken eggs. when you catch the golden egg, in addition to points, you get an extra broken egg.

Game eight is the same as game seven except you can't see an egg in the chute, only when it pops out the bottom.

Games nine and ten are the same as game seven but the chutes shrink up in the direction of the hens. This means you must memorize when the chute comes out for which chicken. In game nine, the chutes are all the same for each round. In game ten, the patterns change per round.

Each white egg caught is worth one point, each golden egg, five.

For ages three to seven.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Bionic Breakthrough (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Bionic Breakthrough</name>
		<desc>The Atari Mindlink was an unreleased controller for the Atari 2600. It was intended for release in 1984. The Mindlink was unique in that you had to move the muscles in your head to control the game. These movements would be read by infrared sensors and transferred as movement in the game. Games would be similar to ones that used the paddle controller, but with the Mindlink instead. Testing showed that players frequently got headaches moving their eyebrows around to play the game. Though Atari could have tried to refine the device over time, Atari simply decided to shelve the Mindlink. Two games were in development for the Mindlink by its cancellation, Bionic Breakthrough &amp; Mind Maze.

Bionic Breakthrough was basically Breakout controlled with the Mindlink, while Mind Maze was an attempt to use ESP through the Mindlink to predict what is printed on cards, which admittedly didn't work. Neither game would see release in a joystick or paddle controlled form in later years, partly due to the failing video game industry, partly due to the games' limited appeal.</desc>

		<desc>Blackjack is based on the casino card game of the same name. You can play alone or with up to 2 other players against the computer that takes the role of the dealer. 

The game follows the same basic rules as its casino counterpart. Each player starts the game with 200 chips and each can bet from 1 to 25 chips to get a hand. A player breaks the bank when he reaches 1000 chips and loses when he has no more chips to bet. In both cases, he is removed from the game. At any time, a player may quit or resume the game by using the game select switch. A player who went broke or who reached 1000 chips may also stay on the game using the same switch. He will then start with 200 chips.</desc>

		<desc>Prototype for Freeway. According to David Crane, he got the idea for Freeway from watching a man trying to cross Lake Shore Drive during rush-hour traffic while attending Chicago's Consumer Electronic Show. 

Freeway originally featured people crossing the road instead of chickens since that was the scenario that inspired David Crane. However some people at Activision complained that they didn't like the idea of people being struck by cars, so chickens were substituted for people before the game was released.</desc>

		<desc>Your girlfriend Daisy is in trouble! Ollie Org is chasing her across the top of the screen, and you need to come to the rescue. To stop Ollie before time runs out, you need to construct a machine. The blue print for the machine is at the bottom of the screen, so all you need to do is locate the parts which are hidden in the numerous houses in a maze like town. When you locate a part, drag it back and place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the start button and the machine is ready to go! To make your task more difficult, there are several obstacles that get in the way. If you enter a house which doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need to hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to time, a flower pot will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and you lose a life. You also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete; while he isn't deadly, he will occasionally appear and press the start button before your machine is complete. If this happens, you will need to drag Pete back to the bomb pit and reassemble all of the machine parts.</desc>

Some of the tricks you can do are loops, rotate, flip, and bounce.
In practice mode, you can select which event to do. In arcade mode, you do the events in a set order.

In advanced mode and later levels, you have to hit the ramp/pipe at more precise angles coming down and gravity and pedaling get harder.</desc>

		<desc>Boggle is an unreleased game for the Atari 2600 programmed by David Crane while he was still working at Atari. In Boggle, which is based on the popular word game of the same name, you must form as many words as possible from a random 4x4 grid of letters. The 2600 version of the game is for two players only, and each player can form a maximum of eight words (likely due to memory constraints of the 2600). The game appears to be fairly close to completion, although there are some glitches, such as all the letters not appearing in the grid right away when you start the game. Still, it's an interesting prototype and it's unknown why Boggle was not completed and released.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Boing! (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Boing!</name>
		<desc>This is a game rather reminiscent of Q*bert.

In this game, you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble.
The object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all on. You start at the bottom left. On the bottom right starts the Bubble Eater. He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.

The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt.

Game variations
The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three.

Levels
There are 5 waves per level.
Level 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on.
Level 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.
Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again.
Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.

Scoring
You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave.
You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are turning on a step a repeatedly.
You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what level or wave you completed.</desc>

		<name>Bouncin' Baby Bunnies</name>
		<desc>A copy of the nearly complete game surfaced in the collection of a former Telesys employee in 2007. According to programmer Alex Leavens, Bouncin' Baby Bunnies is based off the old Bugs Bunny cartoon, where the stork mistakenly delivers Bugs to a gorilla family and they think he's their baby. The only known prototype of Bouncin' Baby Bunnies seems to be fairly complete, but still needs some tweaks and bug fixes. The game didn't get released because of the collapsing game market of 83/84. According to the former Telesys employee: 'Bouncin' Baby Bunnies came too late in the 2600 cycle and, at the time, wasn't worth releasing. The market was saturated.'</desc>

		<name>Bowling</name>
		<desc>Your objective is to roll as high a score as possible, whether you're playing a one-player or a two-player game.  There are ten "pins" to knock down.  You have two tries (or rolls) to knock down the pins each time you're up.  Each game consists of ten "frames" (or turns).

If you succeed in knocking down all the pins on your first roll, it's called a "strike".  A strike is marked with an "x" on the TV screen.

If you leave pins standing, but "pick them up" on your second try, it's called a "spare".  Spares are marked with a "/" on the screen.

An "open frame" occurs when you fail to knock down all then pins in two rolls.  Open frames are indicated with a straight horizontal line (-) on the screen.

The ultimate goal in BOWLING is to roll 12 consecutive strikes for a "perfect" score of 300.</desc>

		<name>Boxing</name>
		<desc>Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a "knockout") or two minutes have elapsed (a "decision"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.
While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the "ropes" and "juggling" him back and forth between alternate punches.</desc>

		<desc>In Brain Games one or two players attempt to earn as many points as possible by solving various puzzles presented by the computer. There are six different puzzles included, which are:

Touch Me: The computer will play a sequence of tones. Each button on the controller represents a different tone, and by pressing the correct button you need to recreate the same sequence.

Count Me: The computer will display a sequence of numbers. Using the controller, you need to press the numbered buttons in the same order the computer displayed them.

Picture Me: The computer will display a series of symbols. It will then scramble the order they are displayed in, and you need to reorder the symbols back into their original configuration.

Find Me: The computer will display a series of objects on the screen, and you need to select the object which is dissimilar from the others. Your score is based on how fast you can successfully do this.

Add Me: The computer will display a list of numbers. You need to enter in the sum of the numbers before the timer runs out.

Play Me: This game allows you to play your own songs in free form mode; each button on the controller represents a musical note. Both controllers can be used for a duet, and several example songs are included in the instruction manual.</desc>

		<desc>In Breakout, there is a wall of bricks along the top of the screen and your goal is to destroy the entire wall one brick at a time! To do this, you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen which is used to reflect a bouncing ball into the bricks. When the ball hits a brick, it will destroy it. You start with five balls, and the game ends when all five fall off the bottom of the screen. Also included are several game variations, including breakthru (the ball will go straight through bricks instead of bouncing back), timed breakout (you have a time limit to gain as many points as you can), and invisible breakout (the bricks are only visible for a short while after one of them is hit).  Other variations allow you to catch the ball or control the direction of the ball.</desc>

There are 16 levels of increasing difficulty - each with four rounds of challenging space combat.  Before you meet the MOTHER SHIP, your pilot skills and nerve are tested against deadly ELECTRON POSTS, ALIEN SAUCERS and smashing SPACE HOPPERS.  This is a battle of speed, accuracy and endurance.  Your time consumption is crucial to your survival.  

If you deplete your time you lose one of your five fighter ships.  The faster you fly, the sooner you'll get to the MOTHER SHIP, allowing yourself more time to destroy it.  You begin with a full time line when you destroy the MOTHER SHIP.  

Be aggressive but don't be reckless.  This is do or die cosmic combat and it's the MOTHER SHIP or YOU!</desc>

		<desc>You have been sent to a long-dead planet to investigate life sign readings. When you get there, giant bugs are there and will harm you as well as a mysterious Phylanx.

As the bugs come out of the ground, you must place your crosshair below them and fire. When the Phylanx appears, it will be green then will go dark green then red. When it turns red, it will move back and forth across the screen. If a bug gets all the way out of its nest or your crosshair is touched by a red Phylanx, you lose a life. Then, if in a two player game, it is player two's turn.

Difficulty switches
Left switch for player one, right for player two
Set to A for beginner, B for advanced.

Game variations
The only variations to choose with the select switch are one or two player.

Scoring
Destroy a bug=1 point
Destroy the Phylanx=5 points

After you score thirty points, you go to the next level up and get a bonus of 8 points.</desc>

As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</desc>

		<name>Burgertime</name>
		<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.

The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.</desc>

Meanwhile, avoid the rocks being thrown at you by the bad dudes. When you've nearly extinguished the flames, the woman will begin jumping up and down. If you swoop down, she'll latch on to your "joystick" with her mouth, and you can fly her off to safety before the flames move in on her.

		<path>./No-Intro/Cabbage Patch Kids - Adventures in the Park (USA) (Proto) (1984-09-13).a26</path>
		<name>Cabbage Patch Kids : Adventures in the Park</name>
		<desc>Another long-lost unreleased prototype has now seen the light of day, thanks to a discovery by Alex Handy at a flea market in California. Alex located a cache of old EPROMs, later realizing he had come across a copy of Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park for the Atari 2600, a title released for the ColecoVision but which never saw the light of day on the 2600. With the help of long-time Atari enthusiast Joe Grand, all of Alex's finds were dumped. The bulk of the dumps were ColecoVision related, but the Cabbage Patch game for the 2600 turned out to be the find of a lifetime for Atari fans. Alex quickly posted all of the dumped binaries on his blog, including 10 different versions of the Cabbage Patch game.

As luck would have it, Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park is an impressive game, comparable in quality to many modern homebrew games. Cabbage Patch Kids is a side-scrolling game, similar to Pitfall! in this regard. The game consists of various screens that have different obstacles that must be overcome in order to proceed to the next screen. These include water-filled pits, bouncing balls, floating platforms, bees, and fires. You must complete ten screens on each level before a timer runs out. While traversing the screens you can also use trampolines to collect objects hidden in the trees for additional points.

Our thanks go out to Alex Handy for graciously sharing all of his impressive flea market haul with the classic gaming community.</desc>

		<name>Cakewalk</name>
		<desc>You must catch pastries from six conveyor belts before they fall on the floor. Each pastry caught is boxed and put behind you. Sometimes, a knife and fork come down the conveyor belt. If you are hit by the utensils or miss a pastry, the janitor has to clean it up. If he has to clean up too many times, he gets upset and storms out and game over.

You can push the button to stop a conveyor belt for about four seconds but if you stop a second one, the first belt starts right back up. On games with belt speed up, you can push right on the joystick to speed up the belt you are in front of.

At the end of each level, you will have a cup of coffee come down the belt, but not fall off the end. When you grab the cup, you get and extra clean-up (life) and the next level begins.

Difficulty switches
Set the left switch to A to start at level five. Set to B to start at level one. The right switch is not used.

The are game variations that force the baker to pause when transferring boxes, making it harder, variations that allow belt speedup, variations with fast moving bakers and variations with all gingerbread men.</desc>

Players can select sponsors (absent in some versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX.  The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.

The Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.</desc>

Using the fire button on your paddle controller, you earn points by dropping bombs into the canyon and destroying as many blocks as possible. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

This game is extremely limited in that it is played using only the paddle controller's fire button. You do not control the movement of the planes and helicopters, but rather you must time your shots to do the most damage.

The cartridge includes a secondary variation titled "Sea Bomber" that is a little more interactive. In this game, you deploy bombs onto seafaring ships, but this time you can use the paddle controller's knob to determine the depth of the bombs.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Centipede (Japan, USA) (En).a26</path>
		<name>Centipede</name>
		<desc>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. 

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.
Dual Player Competition
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.
Team Play
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.

Scoring
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:

Centipede Head - 100 points
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points
Spider at close range - 900 points
Spider at medium range - 600 points
Flea - 200 points
Scorpion - 1,000 points
Flea - 200 points

		<desc>You are trying to become a Spectra-Warrior. To do this, you must fly through the levels of warp zones, destroying radioactive beacons. The higher the level, the more you need to destroy. These beacons are guarded by impact exploding saucers. You can destroy these saucers for points or avoid them. When you destroy a saucer or beacon, do not remain in the same place as the debris will collide with you. You have ninety-nine seconds to destroy the number of beacons indicated by the number on the bottom right of the screen per level.</desc>

		<name>Chase the Chuckwagon</name>
		<desc>Released as part of a promotional campaign for Purina Dog Chow, Chase the Chuck Wagon puts players in control of Chuckie the Dog. Chuckie must be guided through a maze, avoiding objects and the dogcatcher, to the top of the screen where he can go directly beneath the chuck wagon to catch it.

Escaping from the maze allows Chuckie to enter a Reward Screen.  Here, Chuckie can find a bowl of dog food in the maze to eat for extra bonus points.  If Chuckie misses, no points will be awarded, and he will simply be sent to the next screen.

Chase the Chuck Wagon was available only as an exclusive through Ralston-Purina.</desc>

		<name>Checkers</name>
		<desc>Checkers is a computerized version of the popular board game and follows the same rules; the object of the game is to remove all of your opponents pieces from the 8x8 game board. This is accomplished by moving your pieces diagonally forward on the board; an opponents piece is removed from play if one of your pieces jumps over it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponents piece, you must make that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a diagonal forward direction until they reach the other side of the board; that piece then becomes "kinged" allowing movement both forwards and backwards. The game can be played by one player against the computer (with three skill levels available) or two players against each other.</desc>

		<name>China Syndrome</name>
		<desc>The Spectra Island reactor provides power for millions of residents. Ordinarily, there is no problem but there has been an earthquake. This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a meltdown.

There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.

If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</desc>

		<name>Chuck Norris Superkicks</name>
		<desc>In this action game you play the part of Chuck Norris on a quest to reach a monastery where an important leader is kept hostage. The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.</desc>

Each time a clown pops a balloon, the balloon will disappear and you score points. Each player receives five clowns or turns. If you fail to catch a clown on the teeter-totter he will crash and disappear from the playfield. Press the controller button and another clown will bounce off the trampoline from the right or left corner of the playfield. After five clowns have crashed the game is over.

Depending on the difficulty setting, the player has either 8 or 12 guesses to figure out the code by entering in values with the keyboard controller. After each guess, the computer analyzes your input and displays results which indicate if you have a correct digit in the correct position, a correct digit in the wrong position, or no correct digits at all. Points are scored based on how many turns it takes to correctly identify the code. A second game variation called Nim is also included. In this game, two players take turns removing items from a stack. On each turn, a player must take at least one item from a stack, and the player who removes the last item from the screen wins. You can have the computer set up the stacks automatically or set them up manually, and a variation is included where the player who removes the last item from the screen loses rather than wins.</desc>

		<name>Combat Two</name>
		<desc>The year is 2037. Nations no longer fight monster wars, killing millions. Instead, two combatants enter an arena and fight for their countries honor.

This is a sequel to the 1977 game Combat however, there are no planes, just tanks and missiles. Each player starts in a base in a corner, one in the upper left, the other in the lower right. You must seek out your opponent and shoot them three times to destroy their tank. If they are under trees or, in another game variation, behind walls, you must shoot the trees/walls out of the way first to reach them. Each player has three tanks. The winner is the last one standing.

If you are still in your base, you can press the button to fire a homing missile that will seek out you opponent. When the homing missile hits, it counts as two shots. Missiles must reload between shots and the reloading time is several seconds. If a tank is not hit for several seconds, the 'crew' will affect repairs.

There are game variations for trees, which you can drive but not shoot through, walls, which you can neither drive nor shoot through   and versions where you can place the trees/walls where you would like them to be.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Computer Chess (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Video Chess</name>
		<desc>This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.

To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.

Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square.  To carry out the en passant, you must advance your
pawn to the fifth rank.  Your opponent then has the option of moving
his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two
squares.  If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.

Skill levels
These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.
Level 1=15 seconds
Level 2=30 seconds
Level 3=45 seconds
Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds
Level 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds
Level 6=12 minutes
Level 7=10 hours
Level 8=10 seconds

Level 8 is a beginner level.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Confrontation (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Confrontation</name>
		<desc>Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released, but was available directly from Answer for a short time.  Only people who saw it on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough.  I've racked my brain on how to best describe the gameplay of this game, and after much searching I've determined the best description is in Leonard Herman's "ABC's to the VCS" (pick up a copy today!).  Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players pieces at a time.  Take my word for it, they're really all there.

Confrontation is a very unique game which can only be played by two opposing players.  In this unusual chess-like game, each player controls four pawns and a captain.  The blue player's pawns are lined up vertically along the left border of the playfield while the red player's pawns are along the right. Blue's Captain is at the top center of the playfield and red's is at the bottom.  The object of the game is to move your four pawns to the opposite side of the board where they will be removed.  Once all of your pawns are gone, you must get your captain over to your opponent's side of the board and remove it also.  The first player to remove all of his pieces wins the game. 

Confrontation is a highly original strategy game in an era when fast paced action and shooting games were all rage.  If more innovative games like this had been released the crash of 83-84 may not have happened.  But as we all know the video game industry was done in by bad clone after bad clone, and Answer Software was not immune to its effects.  Games like Confrontation were left in dust, never even reaching store shelves.</desc>

		<name>Cookie Monster Munch</name>
		<desc>Cookie Monster hungry! Want cookie!

You are moving around a maze, collecting cookies and bringing them back to a cookie jar.

Games one through three are one player, games four through ten are one or two player.

In games one, two and three, you move Cookie Monster around the maze, get the cookies and return them to the cookie jar, one at a time. Between mazes, Cookie Monster eats each cookie, one at a time. There are three mazes per game. In game one, there are one, two then three cookies. In game two, four, five then six and in game three, seven, eight the nine.

Games four through six are timed. You can carry multiple cookies and keep playing mazes until time runs out. In games four, five and six, you have five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Games seven through nine are also timed but now you play as the Cookie Kid. You are trying to collect cookies for a surprise party for Cookie Monster. Since he hasn't been told this, he is pacing back and forth on the other side on the fence. Each time you pick up a cookie, Cookie Monster jumps over the fence and chases you. He will each and cookies of the path he is coming down and if he catches you, he will eat all the cookies you are carrying. The times for games seven, eight and nine are five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Game ten in the same as game nine (three minute time limit, you are Cookie Kid and chased by Cookie Monster) except the maze is invisible. When you pick up a cookie, the maze flashes for a second so you can figure out the fastest route to take.

You get one point per cookie in the jar.

For ages three to seven.</desc>

Luckily, though, the noble Atlanteans have heard of Alpha Ro's plight and have sent a vast Cosmic Ark thousands of light-years across the galaxy to try and save as many species as possible. As the captain of the Ark, the player will have to contend with deadly meteor storms and planetary defense systems to succeed the mission.

Cosmic Ark features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at any moment. Then it's off to the next planet!</desc>

First, you must successfully land the rocket module on the planet surface (this contains your astrobus). This part of the game is similar to the game Lunar Lander; you must control the speed of the lander to make sure you don't crash! In the second, horizontally scrolling segment you control the astrobus and attempt to pick up the commuters at the bus stops. Once all of the commuters are picked up, return to the rocket module and take off to transport the commuters to the grand central space station. Of course, there are many obstacles which can prevent a successful mission. Meteors, fireballs and space mines all get in the way and can destroy your astrobus. Your astrobus is equipped with a laser that can be used to destroy these obstacles. The astrobus also has a limited amount of fuel; if you start running out you better find more fuel before you crash!</desc>

		<name>Cosmic Creeps</name>
		<desc>Civilization is doomed! You are our last hope! You must protect the Cosmic Kids from the Cosmic Creeps as they escape the orbit-decaying planet!

The first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a little more

The second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.

If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start the Voyage again, only faster.</desc>

		<name>Cosmic Swarm</name>
		<desc>You are at the Waypoint Interstellar Trade Depot, a quiet outpost in space, when suddenly a dormant group of alien, mineral-eating termites awakens. They then begin haphazardly making their nest.

Using your probe ship, you must destroy the termites and their nest blocks. You simply fire at the termites to destroy them but their nest blocks must be energized before you can destroy them. To energize a nest block, you must hit a block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize all the blocks on the screen.

If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a block but you only hit the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not be damageable. If you run into a block, energized or not, or are touched by a termite, you lose a life.

Every so often, a refuel ship travels down and then back up the left or right side of the screen. You must dock with it (touch it) before it gets back to the top or the game ends, no matter how many lives you have left.

To fire, press the fire button. To move, move the joystick while the button is not pressed. If you hold down the button, you can rotate left or right then you will stay at that angle until you rotate again.

The points are:
Shooting a termite that is NOT carrying a block=1 point
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block but only hitting the termite=2 points
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block and hitting the block=3 points
Shooting an energized block=1 point</desc>

		<desc>As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.

You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.</desc>

These can be dropped on the bugs to destroy them as they make their way up from the sewer at the bottom. Just beneath the potted plants are six windows; you need to make sure you destroy the bugs before they can reach these windows. If six of the bugs make it into the windows, a layer of your house will be eaten. This will drop you one step closer to the bottom of the screen, making it more difficult to destroy the incoming bugs! The game ends when six layers of the building have been eaten.

		<desc>The object of this game is to use your flying sub, the Sea Hunter,  to destroy enemies and get treasures.

You move fastest when in the air, half speed when in the water and cannot move forward when on the sea bottom.

Your enemies and their point values are:
Plane = 300
Helicopter = 100
Bird = 0
Boat = 50
Sting Ray = 20
Shark = 100
Angler Fish = 200
Squid = 100
Lobster = 25

You get 1 point for stunning the sea monster but cannot kill him. You cannot do anything with mines but avoid them.

The possible treasures and their point values are:
Sword = 200
Wine Bottle = 400
Sunken Boat = 500
Crown = 1000
Chalice = 2000
Pot of Gold = 3000
Key = 5000

You just play until you crash your sub or run out of fuel. You refuel by docking with the sub at the top of the sea (looks like a boat without a gun) called Sea View.</desc>

		<name>Crazy Climber</name>
		<desc>As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</desc>

But now, our scientists have developed our newest weapon, the Spectron! You will be deployed with this weapon and must destroy as many Morplus as you can.

You have two lasers, one at the top that fires down and one at the bottom that fires up. You control both lasers. Depending on what you select, you can have both lasers stay parallel to each other or move opposite of each other. Your goal is to fire the laser, which fires from one laser to the other, and destroy any enemies caught in your crossfire. The mothership that drops the enemies is indestructible.

Be aware, however, that if you fire you weapon non-stop, it will overheat and then will not fire until it cools a little. Also be aware of the amount of fuel you have because if you run out of fuel, you lose one life. You need to shoot any red fuel pods when they appear on screen.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Dark Chambers (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Dark Chambers</name>
		<desc>Dark Chambers is an arcade action game similar to Gauntlet. You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<name>Deadly Duck</name>
		<desc>You are Deadly Duck and the object is to shoot your bill bullets at crabs, the bricks they drop and dragonflies.

Each level starts with eight crabs. The crabs grab bricks from the sides and try to drop them on you. You can shoot the bricks as they fall and the crabs but if a brick lands on you, you're a dead duck.
When a brick lands, it will stay on the pond for a moment, blocking you from moving horizontally.

On levels two to four, you have two, four and six dragonflies, respectively, moving together just under the crabs. You get ten points for shooting the dragonflies but this makes them angry. They then drop one, two or three bombs (depending on the level). If you are next to a bomb when it explodes, your goose is cooked.

The game continues until you lose all you ducks.

It's all enough to make you quack up.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Death Trap (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Death Trap</name>
		<desc>You have been sent to deliver a message. Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.

IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)

You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.

As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).

After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.

You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.

Game variations
After you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.

The difficulty settings are:
Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.
Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.
Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.

The difficulty switches are not used.
After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.

Scoring
Readiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.
Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.
Destroy the left or right generator=2000 points
Destroy the center generator=5000 points
Shield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.</desc>

You are Demolition Herby and you're out to own the roads. You must drive around a square section to black it out; the object being to black out all sections. There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel. You burn fuel as your drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you gain more fuel. You will lose a life if you run out of fuel or are knocked off the track. If you lose three lives, the game is over.</desc>

You begin the game with five zappers, and the game ends when all five have been destroyed by skulls.

The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</desc>

		<desc>You control a race car on a four lane track, and your goal is to collect all of the dots in order to earn points and advance to the next level! The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants. Trying to stop you is a second car which travels in the opposite direction. This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn't in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.</desc>

		<name>Dolphin</name>
		<desc>Dolphin is a side scrolling action game. You control a dolphin that is being chased by a giant sea squid. Your goal is to earn points by staying alive as long as possible. As you swim away from the squid, you will encounter schools of sea horses which form a vertical row on the screen with only a small opening to swim through. As you approach each school, the dolphins sonar will help you locate the opening; a low pitched sound will indicate the opening is near the bottom of the screen, and a higher pitched sound indicates the opening is near the top. If you miss the opening, the dolphin will lose speed allowing the squid to catch up to you! From time to time, a seagull may fly overhead; if you jump out of the water and touch the seagull, your dolphin will temporarily be able to chase the squid. Throughout the ocean are waves which are indicated by arrows; an arrow pointing the same direction you are travelling will boost the dolphins speed, whereas an arrow pointing the opposite direction slows you down. The longer you stay alive, the faster and trickier the squid will become! The game ends when all of your dolphins have been caught by the squid.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Donkey Kong (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Donkey Kong</name>
		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Donkey Kong Junior (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Donkey Kong Junior</name>
		<desc>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.

Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.

Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</desc>

Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>

Over time, the amulet imbued the dragon with cunning and power so that it began to spread treachery and evil about the peaceful Kingdom. The player's quest begins with the king summoning the player to defeat the dragon once and for all. Taking up the call to arms, the player begins by gathering their strength and fighting creatures in the enchanted countryside to build up enough power to become a Dragonstomper. When finally ready, the player moves on to an oppressed village near the dragon's lair in order to recruit soldiers, buy magical scrolls, and acquire medicines and elixirs needed to face the dragon in its lair. With all of his skills, training, equipment and soldiers, the Dragonstomper descends into the dragon's lair for a final combat to bring peace to the Kingdom.</desc>

The joystick acts as both the gas peddle and clutch; you have the ability to shift from first through fourth, but be careful not to shift too soon because you can't downshift! You must also be careful not to rev your engine too much, or you'll blow your engine and be out of the race. There are two game variations included; in the simpler game, you just need to drive straight to reach the goal. In the advanced variation, you also have the ability to steer and need to keep your car driving straight between the bleachers and road divider.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Dune (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Dune</name>
		<desc>Dune is an unreleased prototype based on the 1984 movie of the same name. It appears that it was to be an action/adventure style game similar to Atari's classic Adventure, but given as the game was never finished, we'll never know for sure. Dune was designed by Atari programmers Bruce Poehlman and Gary Stark, but it appears programming was began by another party. This prototype appears to be only about 30% complete--the game engine seems to be done, but many of the gameplay elements and graphics are missing. Presumably this title was canceled with the Tramiels shut down 2600 game development and fired most of the staff.</desc>

		<name>E.T. : The Extra-Terrestrial</name>
		<desc>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is a licensed adventure game, based on the movie. The adventure takes place on several screens with pits scattered about. The object of the game is to find pieces of E.T.'s phone. Once all pieces are found, E.T. calls home and the spaceship arrives to pick him up. E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. 

The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving. 

Evil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.</desc>

		<desc>You are a space destroyer defending Earth against the Trillians.

The Trillians are using attack bases to launch Kamikaze satellites and Trillian fighters at Earth.

When a satellite/fighter gets close, your weapon will automatically track their vertical motion. You must track them horizontally and fire at the right time.

You lose energy when a fighter shoots you or when a fighter or satellite explodes on Earth.

If you see a fighter with a white stripe (the back of the fighter), keep it on the screen for five seconds and you will come to an attack base. Destroy the attack base to regain energy.

If you lose all your energy, you will explode and the Trillians will celebrate as...The Earth Dies Screaming!</desc>

Yes it appears that Warren was tinkering with a sequel to his smash hit Adventure in his spare time while working at The Learning Company which he founded in 1980 after leaving Atari.   Itâ€™s unknown if Atari actually ordered a sequel or if Warren was doing this on his own and hoping to sell it to Atari.  However since Atari was considering calling SwordQuest: Earthworld Adventure II (and Fireworld Adventure III) the later scenario sounds more plausible.

		<path>./No-Intro/Eli's Ladder (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Eli's Ladder</name>
		<desc>This game was designed to help teach children addition, subtraction and counting. Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.

The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.

The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.

There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Elk Attack (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Elk Attack</name>
		<desc>With a name like Elk Attack you'd probably expect a game involving herds of deadly rampaging elk right?  Well I hate disappoint you but there aren't herds of rampaging elk in this game, in fact this game has nothing to do with elks at all!  Elk Attack is really a port of the obscure Taito arcade game Electric Yo-Yo! Programmer Mark Hahn named the game Elk Attack as a joke, and probably would have changed the name had it been published.

Silly name aside, Elk Attack is really a Pac-Man type game but without a maze.  You control a Yo-Yo type machine, which must use its string to latch onto and destroy all the colored blocks on the screen.  Along the way you'll encounter strange worm like creatures (sorry no elks), which will attempt to disrupt your Yo-Yo.  To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and increase your speed.   However unlike Pac-Man touching a worm while invincible will only net you points, and will not destroy of them.  Because of this its best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down the worms.

Since you use your string as your main means of propulsion, you must be careful as the screen becomes more and more open. For once you latch onto a block you can't let go until you touch it.  The most common way of dying is to accidentally latch onto a block on the other side of the screen and be sucked into a waiting enemy.  Clearing the board in a set pattern is the best way to avoid leaving large (and potentially dangerous) gaps between blocks.</desc>

		<name>Encounter at L5</name>
		<desc>Using an anti-matter launcher, you must defend the starbase L5 against a non-stop horde of blue Megalyte warrior ships and their death ships. As the warriors reach the bottom, they fire on your base. It does not hurt the base but would lose you one of your four lives. Sometimes the death ship takes a dive towards your base, firing as it goes. If it reaches your base, it will destroy your generator, losing you a life.

As hordes of Megalye ships descend, you can hold down the fire button. This will keep the anti-matter launcher in place and moving the paddle will shift the cursor and thus your aim. If you are in danger of being shot or need to destroy a death ship, just release the button and then you can move the launcher left or right.

There are 26 game variations. The odd numbered ones are one player, the even numbered are two player.

Scoring
You score ten points for each death ship you destroy
Your points vary for the warrior ships. The farther from you they are, the more the points.</desc>

The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well.

A team of archaeologists is trapped in an underground maze of dark, winding tunnels. All around them, fearsome zombies are emerging from the crypts. The archaeologists' only hope of survival (apart from some very fast running) is an ancient device known as the 'make-break', which can be used to either create or destroy pieces of wall.

		<name>Escape from the Mindmaster</name>
		<desc>You've been abducted! Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.

You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.

There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:
Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.
Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow
Maze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence
Maze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once
Maze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.

You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.

Atari 2600 Difficulty Switches
The difficulty switch on the left controls the number of chances you get.
A=5 chances
B=9 chances
The difficulty switch on the right controls the Alien Stalker's speed.

		<desc>You are a space attack pilot flying at death range over a gigantic space ship. You must fight through the never ending waves of enemy craft while also firing missiles at the ship itself. Good luck!

You control your ship with the joystick. To fire, simply press the button. You will fire lasers and missiles simultaneously. The missiles will strike where the cross hair in front of your ship is at the time they are launched. Beware of shots fired at you and do not run into anything that flies.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Extra Terrestrials (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Extra Terrestrials</name>
		<desc>When the Personal Computer Museum first discovered Extra Terrestrials, the find itself was enough to send shockwaves through the Atari community. Not only had a previously unknown (but commercially released) title surfaced but it has also been recognized as the only Canadian developed Atari 2600 game. The group was hoping to capitalize on the video game market that was booming at the time. They had hoped to get the game out for the 1983 Christmas season, but delays in the programming precluded that and the game missed the Christmas window. After it was finally finished in early 1984, Peter remembers taking the game out to retailers door to door to purchase copies of the game. They had no distributor, and by then the video game market had collapsed.

This maze game offers a two-player variation on the classic Pac-Man formula. One player controls an alien as the Pac-Man stand-in, eating as many dots as they can throughout the stage. Chasing them is the other player as a human who, like the ghosts, is trying to catch and destroy them.</desc>

		<name>Fantastic Voyage</name>
		<desc>Fantastic Voyage is a vertically scrolling shooter for one player. The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.</desc>

		<desc>Farmyard Fun is a PAL conversion. Originally release in Europe by a Taiwan company.

In Farmyard Fun you control Tom the egg thief who roams the farmyard collecting eggs. The eggs are guarded by hens that defeat Tom with a simple touch. Successfully collecting all eggs advances the player to the next level where the eggs are displayed in different locations. The hens also become faster and harder to avoid. Nice graphics and a quirky entry (Tom arrives riding on the back of a swan) make Farmyard Fun an offbeat winner.</desc>

Up to two prizes will be on the screen at any one time on any floor but the top one. There are a max on ten prizes per screen. On each floor, a Sneaker stands or roams back and forth. You move to another floor or jump to avoid the Sneakers. On the top floor is High-Top, the tallest Sneaker.

You have to get at least nine prizes. After you get the ninth, High-Top will be low enough to jump over. You then jump over him to get the key above him. Then it is on the the next screen.

You get ten points for the first prize, twenty for the second, and so on up to ninety points for prizes nine and ten. You don't HAVE to get the tenth prize unless you want the extra ninety points.

After every screen, you get an extra Eddie; up to a maximum of three in reserve.</desc>

Food starts on the left and moves to the right. You move the mouth to eat the food; the more fattening, the better. After eating several food items, you get the message that you're getting fatter. Then a faster round begins or, in a two-player game, player two plays. The green pickles are fine but avoid the purple pickles. If you eat six purple pickles during the game, you will burp, ending the game. You will then see a closed sign for the snack bar.

The food calorie count, from lowest to highest, is:

1. Green pickle
2. Root beer
3. Cola
4. Soda pop
5. Hot dog
6. Hamburger

		<path>./No-Intro/Final Approach (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Final Approach</name>
		<desc>You are an air traffic controller at an international airport. You must guide planes in to landing safely.

Your first screen is the Approach Control Radar screen or ARC. You must guide the aircraft , using the cursor, until they are headed left to right along the yellow line headed towards the black stripe. Make sure the other planes are headed where they won't immediately head towards each other or off screen.

After the plane gets near the black stripe, move the cursor to the center red light and press the button. You will then be on the Ground Control Approach screen or GCA.  Here you must center the plane's nose on the glide slope and localizer before it arrives at the end of the runway. If the landing is successful, the plane will disappear from the ARC screen and a new one will appear soon to take its place. If not, when you press your joystick button and return to the ARC screen, the plane will still be there. If a plane starts flashing on the ARC and you hear an emergency sound, this plane has an emergency and must be landed first.

Scoring
Successful landing=25 points
Successful emergency landing if landing before other planes=50 points
Aircraft wanders off radar=lose 5 points

You get a control error (lose a life) if you allow a near miss or do not immediately land an aircraft in distress. You are allowed an additional control error (extra life) every 500 points.

Game variations
Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player.
Games 2, 4, 6,  and 8 are two player.

Maximum number of planes on radar:
Games 1, 2, 3, and 4=4
Games 5 and 6=3
Games 7 and 8=2

There are crosswinds on landings in games 3 and 4 only.

Difficulty switch
A=faster planes

You can move the ladder to the appropriate floor of the building to climb up and rescue the trapped worker. Depending on which floors have caught fire, the worker will move to the lowest floor he can which isn't burning; you'll need to estimate which floor he'll be on when you position the ladder. Once the worker is safe, you move on to the next (more challenging) level. The fire in the building may spread quickly! If necessary, you can use a fire hose to put out the fire. Of course, you have a limited supply of water so make sure you don't run out! As the levels progress, the building becomes shorter and the fire spreads faster which means you don't have as much time in which to rescue the trapped victims.</desc>

		<desc>Fireball is an arcade action game similar to Breakout. You are a juggler, and you need to keep multiple fireballs within the play field. You can hold on to two fireballs at a time, so be careful because if you try to catch a third it wall fall off the screen. Your goal is to destroy the bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with the fireballs. When all the bricks are destroyed, you move on to the next round and are given one additional fireball to keep in play. Five different game variations are included:

Firetrap: Two additional fireballs are trapped within brick walls. Once a hole forms in the walls, you will also need to keep these additional fireballs in play.

Marching Blocks: In this game, each time you catch a fireball the rows of blocks will drop down one level. From time to time, a mystery fireball may also appear.

Knock-A-Block: This is the most basic game variation. There is a solid wall of blocks at the top of the screen that you need to destroy.

Migrating Blocks: In this game, the rows of blocks move! Every few seconds each row of blocks will rotate either to the left or to the right.

Cascade: There are five additional fireballs trapped within the block formation! When you destroy enough blocks to release an extra fireball, it too will need to be kept in play.</desc>

		<desc>In Fishing Derby, your goal is to be the first of two players to catch 99 pounds of fish. Each player is on a dock at the top of the screen, and you control the fishing line in the water. By moving the fishing line up or down, you can catch the fish that are swimming by. The deeper down you go, the bigger the fish are. When you catch a fish, you need to real it in! To make the game more difficult, a shark is constantly swimming back and forth. If you have a fish on your line and it touches the shark, the shark will eat it and you then will have to catch another fish. Two difficulty levels are available, and the game can be played by one person against the computer or two players against each other.</desc>

		<name>Flag Capture</name>
		<desc>Flag Capture is an action/strategy game for one or two players. Your goal is to locate a flag hidden somewhere on a 9x7 grid. Using the joystick you can move your explorer around the grid; on any square you can press the button to see if the flag is located in that square, or if not to receive a clue as to the flags location. If the square doesn't contain the flag, one of several items may appear: an arrow indicating what direction the flag is, a number indicating how many squares away the flag is, or a bomb which will cause you to have to start again. In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games: in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games, players take turns moving around the grid. Several skill levels are available which control the players moving speed, allow the flag to be stationary or move, or add an invisible wall around the playfield.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Flash Gordon (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Flash Gordon</name>
		<desc>You are Flash Gordon. Many spacemen have entered Spider City but never returned. Your job, Flash, is two fold. Rescue any spacemen you find in the tunnels of Spider City and destroy all the hatching pods.

The lower part of the screen is a map. You are the horizontal line, the hatching pods are the vertical lines and the Disrupters are the crosses. The upper part of the screen is the close-up of the action.

You rescue spacemen by touching them with your ship. You destroy hatching pods, and the spider warriors that hatch, by flying to the pods then shooting the warriors.

You can also shoot generators, patrol ships and debris. Shooting the generator will keep the Disrupter from moving about the city for a little bit but the debris never stops while you are within, so don't hang out in the Disrupter.

If you destroy five warriors at one hatching pod or your ship is destroyed when it returns, you will have a shield for a short time. There will be two beeps to warn you of the shield leaving.

The scoring is as follows:
10 points = Debris
25 points = Patrol Ship
70 points = Rescued Spaceman
100 points = Disrupter Generator

You get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second, 300 for the third and so on.

You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do that, right?

Every time you conquer a city, you get an extra man.</desc>

		<name>Frankenstein's Monster</name>
		<desc>In the cold dark night you make your way through the ghoulish castle of Dr. Frankenstein. There you must prevent him from completing his creation.

Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.

You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.

You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points.

Game variations
The only variation is one or two players

Difficulty switches
Left for player one, right for player two
Set to A for a five minute timer. Set to B for an eight-and-a-half minute timer.

Scoring
You start with five hundred points.
If you touch a ghost, tarantula or spider, you lose 20 points
If you touch a bat, you lose 10 points
If you fall through a trapdoor, you lose 100 points
If you fall in the pool of acid, you lose 200 points as well as one life
Each stone you place gets you 500 points
If you place all four stones, you get a 100 point bonus for each unit of time saved.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Frog Pond (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Frog Pond</name>
		<desc>The history behind Frog Pond is a little hazy, it's either a victim of bad timing or of management/programmer dispute.  The premise behind Frog pond is simple, you control a frog who must try and catch various insects with its tongue in a race to see how many points you can score.  The game subject and total lack of difficulty almost guarantee that it was to going to be aimed at small children, much like Nick Tuner's previous game Demons to Diamonds.  The problem with children's games is that they're really not alot of fun for adults to play, and Frog Pond is no exception. 

If Frog Pond looks familiar to you it's probably because it's an almost exact copy of Mattel's Frog Bog, which was released for the 2600 as Frogs and Flies under the M-Network label.  According to Nick Turner, this is a completely coincidence and neither company had any idea what the other had been working on.  According to Nick he wanted to add more options and gameplay to the game, expanding it to 8K.  Atari wasn't keen on spending the extra money on more memory for a children's game, and refused to allocate the extra 4K.  Frog Pond was shelved and Nick left Atari shortly afterwards.

As you might expect the gameplay is very simple.  Every time you press the fire button, your frog jumps and shoots out his tongue.  If your tongue hits an insect you score points and your frog gets a pleasant snack.  The are several different insects to catch, which are worth varying amounts of points.

While the larger insects are slightly faster than the smaller ones, they still don't put up much of fight.  However if you take too long to grab your bug he'll fly away.  If you miss six insects the sun sets and the games ends.</desc>

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<desc>You're an Eskimo who wants to build an igloo to live in during the cold season. To do this, you must jump from ice-block to ice-block, while avoiding wildlife such as birds and crabs. Coming with contact with any of these will cause them to push you off the block and into the deadly water. Once you have built your igloo, you must enter it to proceed to the next level. Remember, you must build it before the temperature drops to 0°. You have four lives.</desc>

The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</desc>

		<name>Gangster Alley</name>
		<desc>S.B.I. (Spectravision Bureau of Investigation) file on Chicago Joe and his gang:
We apprehended Chicago Joe but in retaliation, his gang have holed up in an apartment building, taking hostage a dame and her kid. The following men have been positively identified:

Shifty
2. Scar Face
3. Mugsy
4. Lefty
5. Nitro Ed

Your orders are to snipe any gang member. DO NOT SHOOT AN INNOCENT! Watch out for Nitro Ed. He likes to play with hand grenades. One of those and you're pushing up daisies. Good luck.

You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your ammo is limited so don't fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof, will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to disarm him. You get money for each gangster shot. The values for level one are:

1. Mugsy=$20
2. Scare Face=$30
3. Lefty=$40
4. Shifty=$50
5. Disarming Nitro Ed=$100

These amounts increase for each level by $10.  You also get $10 for each bullet you have left after each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a nighttime level. In this level, you must fire one bullet to light up the windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again.
If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or you total amount if you have less than $1000.

If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he will shoot you and you will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game is over. And Nitro Ed will laugh at you. You start with four vests and can earn another at $5000.</desc>

As you probably guessed, Garfield stars the lovable orange furball from the Sunday comics (no not Alf!).  Garfield is on a mission to find Nermal (wasn't he always trying to get AWAY from Nermal?), and to accomplish this mission he's going to have to cross five different action filled screens while keeping a looking out for the nefarious Odie!  The movement in Garfield is a bit strange, you don't move left or right with the joystick but by pressing the fire button to jump.  It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but fits in well with the whole fence post idea.</desc>

		<desc>You are in your vehicle which has terrible fuel efficiency. A real gas hog. You are trying to travel along but there is one or more ships above you that are trying to bomb you. To make things worse, there are holes in the road and other ships you need to shoot so as to not ram them.

As you go along, you can accelerate or decelerate to avoid being bombed but be careful because you might ram some ships near the ground. You can jump to avoid them or blast them for points. You will also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or their value will be deducted from you score.

As this is Gas Hog, you will soon run low on fuel. You must get below ground via the occasional holes, to grab a refuel marker. Do not stay below ground, however, as you travel in the wrong direction while there. You start with four lives and lose one if you are hit by a bomb or ship or run out of fuel.</desc>

		<desc>This game has nothing to do with the Atari arcade game or any of the home-ported versions.

You are the great explorer, Sir Robert Wittenbottom. You have discovered an ancient civilization deep within the forest of a mysterious island. Since you're a likable old fellow, they have decided to induct you into their council of warriors. But first you must prove your worthiness by running the gauntlet.

You are given three glasses of water. You must run through the gauntlet to the ceremonial fires and use your water to put them out. You current glass of water will then be refilled then it is off to the next fire.

Of course, it is not that easy. You must jump over rocks and logs, duck under stones, arrows and tomahawks, and avoid hitting trees or touching the sides of the gauntlet.You can ease the thirst of the old men you come across for points but it will cost you water. The game is over when you run out of your third glass of water. To jump, just press the fire button. To duck, pull back then press the fire button.

Scoring:
Jump over a rock or a log=50 points
Duck under an arrow, stone or tomahawk=100 points
Give an old man a drink of water=250 points
Duck under the Secret Talisman=500 points
Extinguish the ceremonial flame=500 points

Difficulty switches
Left switch:
A=joystick less responsive, more challenging
B=joystick more responsive, less challenging
Right switch:
A=jumping and ducking more difficult
B=jumping and ducking less difficult</desc>

		<desc>Your friend is trapped inside Ghost Manor! There are five different screens you need to get past before you can rescue your friend from the top floor of the manor. The game begins in the graveyard outside the manor; here you play tag with a friendly rainbow ghost or skeleton which will supply you with spears you can fire at enemies. In the second screen, you approach the guarded entrance of the manor. Using the spears you collected, you need to shoot all of the enemies blocking the entrance. The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Ghostbusters (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

		<name>Glib : Video Word Game</name>
		<desc>This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.

The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.</desc>

		<name>Golf</name>
		<desc>Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two players. The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.</desc>

		<desc>Good Luck, Charlie Brown should have been the last of the Children's Work Shop releases, but never saw the light of day. The only known version is very incomplete with little gameplay implemented, but rumors persist of a far more complete version in existence. According to the catalogs Good Luck, Charlie Brown was supposed to be released in the summer of 1983 and since this prototype is dated April of 1984, we can assume development was taking longer than expected. By 1984 Atari had canceled the Children's series, so Good Luck Charlie Brown would have been canceled with it.</desc>

		<desc>A pesky gopher is after your carrot patch! Your goal is to stop it before all of your carrots are gone. The gopher will be tunneling in the ground at the bottom of the screen; you are at the top and need to fill in the gophers tunnels with your shovel. The gopher is fast, however, and if you don't fill in the tunnels quick enough it will make it to the surface and run off with one of your carrots! If the gopher manages to take all of your carrots, the game will be over. From time to time there will be a duck that flies overhead. As the duck passes by, it will drop a seed; if you catch the seed and plant it, a new carrot will grow to replace one of the ones that was stolen. Several difficulty levels are included, which control the speed and intelligence of the gopher, and whether or not the duck will appear.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Gorf (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Gorf</name>
		<desc>Gorf is a game similar to Space Invaders, alien vessels approach closer and closer in their threatening row formation.

The game itself consists of four levels:

1. The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship &amp; shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;

The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;

The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading "towards" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;

The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.

Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</desc>

Your goal is to reach the finish line in the shortest possible time on one of the four different tracks included. Of course, there will be obstacles on the tracks which will slow you down if you're not careful. Numerous other cars will often get in your way, oil slicks will cause you to temporarily lose control, and on the more difficulty tracks narrow bridges will cause you to come to a complete stop if you miss the path.</desc>

		<name>Gravitar</name>
		<desc>The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</desc>

As you move forward, you can increase to four speeds. You must avoid or shoot the meteorites, shoot the aliens (but be warned: they shoot back), and always run from the super alien.

On the screen, at the top is your score, just below that is the short range scanner. This shows you, the aliens, the meteorites and, if you run into it, the super alien. On the bottom left is the remaining ships (lives) On the bottom right is the velocity indicator. On the bottom center is the long range scanner. This shows you, the aliens and the super alien, but not the meteorites.

As the super alien approaches, there will be an alarm sound. If the super alien catches you, you will be unable to move or fire and will lose a life. The game ends is you lose all your lives or get 999,999 points.</desc>

On the shooting screen, gremlins are approaching from the distance. You must shoot them before they reach you. If one reaches you, you lose a life. After they are all dead, it is back to the first screen at a faster level. In later levels, puddles of water will divide the gremlins in two.</desc>

The planets are located at either the top or the bottom of the screen, and are defended by a shield. Dromeda is in the middle of the screen, and will be launching explosive devices at the planets. You control a spaceship which is the last hope to save the planets. Unfortunately, your ships lasers are unable to reach Dromeda, so you you must shoot the explosives as they come in. If you miss any explosives, they will destroy part of the shield. If a large enough hole forms, an explosive could get through and destroy an entire planet. The game ends when all of your planets have been destroyed.</desc>

You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</desc>

		<desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

		<desc>Protect the children and fight for your life "the night HE came home!"

Babysitting a group of children in a large two-story house, players assume the role of Laurie Strode as psychopath Michael Myers has escaped from the mental institution and has come back for revenge.  Players must guide the children to safe rooms while avoiding Michael Myers and his knife.

The house is large and full of dangerous blackouts and dead-ends within its sixteen rooms.  However, Laurie is not completely defenseless.  There is a knife that can be found to protect herself once the familiar theme music begins to play and killer remains in pursuit.  

Players will advance to the next level by either stabbing Michael Myers twice, or rescuing five of the children.</desc>

		<name>Halo 2600</name>
		<desc>The year is 2552. Planet Earth still exists, but overpopulation has forced many of her former residents to colonize other worlds. After contact with an outer colony was lost, a battlegroup was sent to investigate and was almost completely destroyed; only one badly damaged ship returned to tell of a seemingly unstoppable alien warship that had effortlessly annihilated their forces.

This was humankind's first encounter with a group of aliens they eventually came to know as the Covenant, a collective of alien races bent on wiping out humanity. A desperate plan is set in motion: board a Covenant vessel and learn the location of the Covenant home world. But before the mission begins, Covenant forces strike and annihilate the attack force.

The Covenant are now on Earth's doorstep. One ship escapes and makes a blind jump into deep space, hoping to lead the Covenant away from Earth. The ship crashes on Halo--an artificial ring world that is actually a weapon capable of destroying all life in the galaxy should it fall into the hands of the Covenant.

You are the Master Chief--all that remains of a classified military project to build a series of genetically enhanced super- soldiers. You are humanity's last and best hope against the Covenant--but you're woefully out-matched, and survival is not guaranteed. Can you battle your way through the massive world that is Halo, defeat the Covenant, and save humanity?</desc>

Guess a correct letter, and it will appear on the screen in the proper location, but if you guess a letter that isn't in the word then you are one step closer to being hung. Guess eleven incorrect letters, and the game is over. A point is earned each time a word is completed. Several difficulty settings are included which affect the number of letters in the words. The game can be played by one or two players, and in the two player version the words can optionally be created by one of the players instead of the computer.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Hard-Head (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Unknown Activision Game #2</name>
		<desc>This mysterious prototype was found in a salvage yard in 1998 by Ben Liashenko. Since the label that once existed for this game has long since fallen off, we have no idea what the identity of this game might be.
In this game you control a little alien who must use the blocks at the bottom of the screen to build a tower and escape. As the blocks come rolling down the conveyer belt, you must jump up and bump them so they land somewhere on the screen. Once you have constructed a nice little tower, you must carefully jump on the conveyer belt and then climb the tower to the next screen.
The graphics and sounds for this game are top notch; it's obvious that a lot of work went into this game. Everything from the smooth animation of your character to the cute "Can-Can" sequence at the start of the game (yes, you read that right) screams quality. So why was this game never released? Unfortunately, no one but the programmer knows the answer to this. One possibility is that he or she may have left Activision before the game was completed.</desc>

		<desc>At the start, there's sniper machine gun fire from the bushes.  When the shooter stops briefly to reload, you can run past.  To reach the 2nd woman, you have to jump over the lake.  Run until the last moment (your heel is on the edge), then press the button to jump.  If you jump too soon, you fall into the water.  After the woman on the island, you move to the level above, where you have to run by a fire-breathing dragon.  You have to time it right to run by when he pauses blowing fire.  You can only make it to the hole in the ground.  Push the button to drop in, and a woman appears.  If you get too greedy here, she turns into a snake and... Ow!  Time leaving the pit to avoid the dragon, and run off the screen to the left.  You will then be on the top level, where you have to chase a woman.  Meanwhile, gargoyles appear in random positions and drop molten lava.  If a gargoyle appears over you when you are "scoring points" with her (listen for the warning sound), you must push the button to release her and run.  You can catch her again, and continue indefinitely, except that the gargoyles speed up each time you catch her.  When you get to 69 points you get another life (you start out with 3).</desc>

		<name>Haunted House</name>
		<desc>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the  four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.

The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!

You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter so be careful! You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score!</desc>

		<name>Home Run : Baseball</name>
		<desc>The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base. 

The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</desc>

To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.</desc>

		<name>I Want My Mommy</name>
		<desc>Open, Sesame! is an action platform game. You control Ali Baba, and your goal is to reach the cave of treasures. The treasury entrance is at the top of the screen, and you begin each level at the bottom and need to climb your way up. To do so, you will need to find a good location where you can throw a rope up to the next platform and climb up (there will be a dot on the platform where you can safely throw a rope, two on each floor). Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from time to time; if caught, this can be used to temporarily freeze a guard. When you successfully enter the treasury, you then move on to the next level of gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>Ice Hockey is an ice hockey game for one player against the computer or two players. Each team consists of two players, one offensive and one defensive. At any given time one player is active and can be controlled while the other remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal then the defensive player becomes active, otherwise you control the offensive player. Each player has the ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body check their opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.</desc>

Your buddy and you are on a special mission behind enemy lines, and you've been sleeping, eating, and breathing jungle combat for the last two weeks. Your tired, but that never affect your razor-sharp judgement and your will to survive.

Your main weapons are machine guns, grenades, and your own cunning in the face of danger. Sometimes you'll have a tank at your disposal, which comes in handy when enemy fire is particularly brutal.

You move swiftly through the jungle, wading through rivers and resting from time to time with the ruins of bombed-out buildings. You're turning out of ammunition and grenades but you know the battle can't last forever. Sooner or later, one side is going to emerge victorious. Let's just hope it's yours!</desc>

		<desc>Immies and Aggies is an odd shooting game that involves marbles (yes marbles).  For you see, Immies and Aggies are actually types of marbles (Aggies are agates, while Immies are glass imitations of agates), although from the game graphics you really can't tell.  In fact the graphics consist mostly of squares that appear to be randomly placed around the screen.  If you squint and stare really hard at the screen you can almost imagine that those squares are anything (marbles, alien bases, E.T. carts, etc.).  However the poor graphics really don't distract much from the poor gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Indy 500</name>
		<desc>Indy 500 is a racing game played from a top down point of view. In the one player game, your goal is to complete as many laps as you can in 60 seconds. In the two player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer.  In tag, one player is "it" and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.</desc>

		<name>Ixion</name>
		<desc>Ixion is a port of the unreleased 1983 Sega coin-op of the same name, Ixion is an interesting game that doesn't seem to play like anything else in the 2600 library. Your goal in Ixion is to grab the five white squares scattered across the screen and spell the word Ixion before your time runs out. At the start of each level only certain squares are visible, and to get around more easily you must first reveal the missing squares. To reveal the missing squares, the player must move a brown sphere over an empty square. This sphere is normally stationary, but it can be moved by shooting or ramming into it. This sends the sphere bouncing around the screen, revealing squares and destroying enemies in its travels. After a short time of bouncing around the sphere will stop, requiring the player to move it again to reveal more squares. Learning how to move the sphere where you want is the key to mastering Ixion. Also moving around the game grid are enemy drones, which will attempt to destroy your ship. Unfortunately, their shots destroy tiles, making your path much more difficult to traverse. Enemy drones only take one shot to defeat, but will take out the tile they are on when they explode.</desc>

Each horizontally scrolling level in the game is loosely based on a different James Bond movie. The levels included are Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only. Each level has a variety of enemies trying to destroy you, and a unique goal that must be accomplished to continue on (for example, you may have to land on a hidden oil rig to stop Seraffino, or find Stromberg's undersea laboratory and destroy it). If you can complete all the missions, you win the game! Good luck, Mr. Bond.</desc>

		<name>Jawbreaker</name>
		<desc>Jawbreaker is a video game programmed by John Harris and released in 1981 for the Atari 400/800 by On-line Systems.[1]

Originally intended to be a fairly straight Pac-Man clone, Jawbreaker emerged as a relatively inventive version with unique gameplay. It was widely lauded by reviewers, and became a major seller for Sierra Online. The story of its creation forms a portion of Steven Levy's book, Hackers.</desc>

		<name>Journey Escape</name>
		<desc>You're on the road with the rock band Journey! After each concert, your goal is to guide the five band members to the escape vehicle so they can get to the next concert on time. You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</desc>

		<name>Joust</name>
		<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>

		<name>Jr. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>Jr. Pac-Man features gameplay similar to the original Pac-Man, but with a few changes. As Jr., you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.</desc>

Jungle Fever is just a gender-reversed version of Burning Desire in which your boyfriend is being held for sacrifice and you must rescue him while avoiding the rocks thrown by the amazons.

Knight on the Town involves you (the knight in question) building a bridge over the moat to reach the princess. You must contend with a castration-minded alligator and a troll. Also, if you select it, the bird above you will drop fire to remove one of your bridge sections. Once you reach your lady, you can get your "reward".</desc>

		<desc>Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all four have been survived.  If you don't survive these adventures, you will not only lose your own life but that of the lovely Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals!

The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your doom?  The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river.  Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with.  Don't forget to go up for air!  In the third part, you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics.  Once you've cleared all these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked spear.  Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?

Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase).  The view is always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.</desc>

		<name>Kabobber</name>
		<desc>Kabobber was originally a prototype game that was programmed by Rex Bradford, known for his work on Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Jedi Arena. It was discovered in 2000 and improved upon a little before being released to the public in ROM format. Kabobbers are strange (but cute) little creatures who just love wreaking havoc. Your objective is to send in your Buvskies to krush the Kabobbers before they krush you. You can have up to nine Buvskies onscreen at one time, but you have reserves waiting offscreen should one get krushed. You move your Bruvskies across the grid, jumping on enemy Kabobbers in order to defeat them and earn additional reserve Bruvskies. The baby Bruvskies become big ones when they defeat an enemy. The enemies get tougher and tougher, meaning very good timing is required in the later stages. Above all, you must reach Princess Buvsky before she reaches the rainbow energy at the other end of the level and devours it. A very unique game, but also somewhat fun.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Kamikaze Saucers (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Kamikaze Saucers</name>
		<desc>Kamikaze Saucers was a little known 2600 game that most people assumed was never even started.  However after the programmer gave the rom image to Atari Age to be distributed to the gaming community, the game proved to be very much real.  There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it.  All these things make this prototype all the more interesting, and makes one wonder what other games Syncro may have had in the works.

Kamikaze Saucers is your average shooter along the lines of Atlantis or Demon Attack.  You must shoot down the saucers that buzz across the screen using your oversized phallic looking ship.  If if fail to shoot the saucers down in a timely manner they will go Kamikaze on you big time!  Three large ships will come at you from the top of the screen, and if you can't destroy them before they crash into you you'll lose a life.

Thankfully there's a little more to Kamikaze Saucers than mindless shooting.  Notice the two meters on each side of the screen?  These are your ammo meters, the left meter is for shooting from the left and the right meter for shooting on the right.  For some reason, shooting from the center counts as shooting from the left (as far as ammo is concerned).  The shooting in KS is a bit like Atlantis, all your shots are aimed towards the center of the screen.  So shooting from the left or right will cause your shots to angle towards the center like shooting from Atlantis's side guns.  This takes a bit to get used to, but actually makes the game more challenging.</desc>

You fly above your town's forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.</desc>

		<name>King Kong</name>
		<desc>King Kong has taken a lady to the top of the Empire State Building. It is up to you to rescue her but it won't be easy. Kong is throwing bombs at you.

This game is a clone of Donkey Kong, except instead of barrels, you must avoid bombs. You must make your way across the floors and up the ladders while jumping over bombs for points and holes in the floor. There is also a timer in the upper right. It starts at nine-hundred ninety and counts down ten points per second. If you are hit by a bomb or fall through a hole in the floor or the time reaches zero, you lose a life. Occasionally, Kong will release a magic bomb that gives more points when you jump it as well as moves you to the next floor up. Once you reach the top floor, the game starts again but faster.</desc>

The device can hold up to five blocks. A block which is not caught and placed in the playing area or pushed back up the belt is considered a drop. The blocks are solid colours, but there is also a flashing block which can be used as a wildcard on any colour.</desc>

While building the bridge, the knight must dodge a dragon's fire, an alligator swimming in the moat and a little gremlin with a big mouth to bite the knight's penis off. To make matters worse, the gremlin moves faster for every piece of bridge placed. The goal of this game is to get across a completed drawbridge and climb to the top of the tower to get the princess in the least amount of time. For Lady in Wading, a studly prince is abducted and an Amazon takes the knight's place.</desc>

If the Thirsties succeed in draining the pool, it's "Game Over" for Kool-Aid Man. If Kool-Aid Man succeeds, then he wins and goes on to the next level of difficulty. Oh Yeah!</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Krull (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Krull</name>
		<desc>Krull is a multi part action game based on the movie of the same name. A beast and his army have traveled through space until finally landing on the distant planet of Krull and ravaging the entire planet. But there is a prophecy which tells of a king and queen who will someday take back the planet. These future rulers are Princess Lyssa and Prince Colwyn. But before their marrage, Princess Lyssa is captured by the beast! 

You play the part of Prince Colwyn on a mission to rescue Lyssa and destroy the beast. The game is divided up into several parts.

The first part takes place during the foiled wedding. A large number of slayers arrive at the castle, and you need to defeat as many as you can to earn points. But eventually Princess Lyssa is captured.

In the next section you need to ride your horse towards the Widow's web; on the way you can collect Glaives which may be used to fight the beast. Once you reach the web, you need to make your way to the cocoon at the top of the web in order to find the correct path to the Black Fortress. The crystal spider along with strands of the web make maneuvering your way around this screen a challenge. Once you know the correct path, you ride on to the Black Fortress. 

Here you need to use the Glaives you've collected to free the Princess from a prison, and then destroy the beast!  After successfully completing all tasks, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

		<desc>A conversion of the arcade game of the same name, which itself is loosely based on a movie, Kung-Fu Master is a side scrolling action game for one or two players, who alternate turns.

Mr. X has captured the pickpocket Sylvia and it is up to Thomas, a kung-fu master who owns a restaurant, to get her back. She is located on the top floor of Mr. X's castle and Thomas will need to fight his way to the top. Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.</desc>

		<desc>Looking a little like a cross between Racquetball and Space Cavern, Kyphus is an odd game in which the player must maneuver a dumpy looking guy through a pseudo-3D maze of rooms avoiding what appears to be a glowing cloud that shoots lasers, while being followed by a multi-colored robot that just might be a monkey in disguise.
Unfortunately, this prototype is very incomplete.  There appears to be no collision detection, few sounds, and almost no gameplay.  The only thing one can really do in this prototype is to move run from room to room, although with no collision detection implemented there is no threat from the robot or cloud.  Each room of the maze appears to have a different color, and has three to four exits (two on the sides and one at the top and bottom).  The maze is made up of 64 rooms, but doesn't appear to have a set pattern.</desc>

		<name>Laser Gates</name>
		<desc>Laser Gates is a side scrolling shooter. Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields.</desc>

Your task won't be easy, since there are four police officers in the vault who are constantly trying to catch you! Located throughout the maze are numerous doors. As you run through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily close a door in an attempt to block the police. You can only close two doors at a time, and any closed doors automatically open again after a short amount of time. When all of the gold in the maze has been collected, the exit to the vault will open and you can escape and move on to the next, more difficult vault. Occasionally a bonus item will appear in the maze, such as a cash bag, crown, or briefcase, which can be collected to earn even more points.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/London Blitz (USA).a26</path>
		<name>London Blitz</name>
		<desc>During WWII German bombers turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Most bombs exploded on impact but some would sit for hours, days or weeks before detonating. It was up to the Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a Lance Corporal in the Royal Engineers, it is your job to defuse these bombs.

First, you will check your London map to see where the bombs are. Then it is defusing time. 

On the C64, you must use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the numbers next to a switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If the number is wrong, you must change it again and keep trying. 

On the Atari 2600, you slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls the left switch, the middle the middle and the bottom the right.You set the slide to a spot the move to the switches and push right. On orange bombs, what slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb and on blue bombs, you can't control the switches. They just randomly change and you push right and hope you disarm in time.

The possible ranks are:
Lance Corporal
Corporal
Sargent
Staff Sargent
Warrant Officer
Second Lieutenant
First Lieutenant
Captain

At the start of the game, you can select which rank to start at, from Lance Corporal to Second Lieutenant on the C64 or from Lance Corporal to First Lieutenant on the Atari 2600.
 
Every time you disarm a bomb, you move up levels within your rank. Move up eight levels and you are promoted. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, you are demoted a level in rank.

You lose the game is you are demoted below Lance Corporal or a bomb explodes while you are near it, a not-very-healthy thing to happen.

You win if you get promoted to Captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.</desc>

		<desc>Looping is an unreleased prototype for the Atari 2600 based on the 1981 Venture Line arcade game of the same name. It's unknown why this game was never released, as it appears to be complete and would have been one of the better titles released by Coleco on the 2600. It is fairly close to the ColecoVision version of the game in terms of gameplay, but is a difficult game, either of which could be a reason for why it was not released.</desc>

		<desc>The Lord of the Rings: Journey to Rivendell has been the subject of speculation for many years by Atari collectors. Now one of the most sought-after Atari 2600 prototypes is finally available. What's the story, you ask?
Way back in 1983 Parker Brothers featured this game in one of their catalogs. Video game and Tolkien fans alike were excited by this announcement, but the wait would be in vain. Lord of the Rings was never released, and Parker Brothers reportedly informed people that called and asked for the game that it was sold out in an attempt to cover up for the fact that it was never published.</desc>

You need to catch all of the luggage that is tossed out, or all of your clothes will be scattered around the airport. As the levels progress, more and more luggage will need to be caught, and the games speed increases. There are two difficulty levels available; the easier mode gives you two men to catch luggage with, and the harder mode gives you only one man. Several other game variations are also available: if the terrorist suitcase option is enabled, explosive suitcases will occasionally appear. If you don't catch these, the game immediately ends regardless of how many lives you have left. If the suitcase control option is enabled during a two player game, you are able to control the direction your opponents suitcases travel.</desc>

		<desc>M.A.D. (which stands for Missile Attack and Defense) is an arcade action game somewhat similar to Missile Command. You control a photon cannon at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to protect six energy stations located to your left and right. Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over. A two player variation is also included; one player will control the photon cannon, and the second player controls a cursor and can select when and where an enemy will drop. The players alternate between offense and defense in this version.</desc>

		<name>M*a*s*h</name>
		<desc>M*A*S*H was one of the many attempts by various software companies to take a successful movie or television show and convert it into a playable game.

In this game, you play the role of "Hawkeye Pierce," a surgeon stationed at the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital #4077 during the Korean War (1950-1953). There are two main stages in the game, each of which you must pass to move to the next round. The first mission involves rescuing injured soldiers from the battlefield with your helicopter and returning them to home base without being shot down by enemy tanks. The second mission takes place in the operating room while you are required to carefully remove bullets and shrapnel from wounded soldiers... it is very similar to the classic "OPERATION" tweezers game by Milton Bradley.

Each set of missions are repeated four times. The first player to reach 999 points wins the game. There are four different variations of games, each selectable as either one player (against the computer) or two-player mode.</desc>

		<name>Malagai</name>
		<desc>You are Commander Harrington "Harry" Crag of the starship "Endless Search". You are put into a Malagai base for repairs but now the Malagai are holding you ransom. They want your advanced technology.

There are three airlock doors per starbase. You must get the correct key for each door. Each is held by one of three Malagai. The order of which Malagai is holding which key is shown by the pictures above the starbase.

If you are away from your assigned compartment for too long, as indicated by the line at the bottom of the screen, the Malagai will attack and you will need to return to your compartment to make them friendly again. When you touch a Malagai and, if it is the correct one, get the airlock door key, the Malagai will attack and the airlock will flash, on most game variations (see below). You must then make your way to the airlock. One door will disappear and the Malagai will become friendly again. After you open the third door, it is off to the next starbase.

After the third (blue) starbase, you get an extra man.

Game Variations:
Version 1: All the Malagai have different shapes and colors
Version 2: All the Malagai have the same shape but different colors
Version 3: All Malagai are the same shape and color and the airlocks do not blink to show you got the right key.

Scoring:
Touch a Malagai while they're friendly=100 points (50 point bonus if it has the correct key)
Open airlocks one or two=100 points
Open airlock three to exit starbase orange or teal=150 points
Open airlock three to exit blue starbase=250 points

Difficulty switches set to "B"=10 seconds from compartment before Malagai attack
Difficulty switches set to "A"=15 seconds from compartment before Malagai attack</desc>

Mama brings pasta to the table. You must either eat the pasta, toss it to Frankie the cat when he is at the window, or toss it to Sergio the dog when he is under the table.

You have four lives. If you eat more than 20 plates of pasta, you will burst (literally) and lose 1 life. If more than 9 plates of pasta are placed on the table, it will collapse and you will lose 1 life.

To eat pasta, you move the joystick to the right then the left. To toss pasta to a pet, you move the joystick to the right then up or down in one smooth motion. You must throw when Mama's back is turned and the cat is in the window or the dog is in the right spot under the table. If you throw food at the floor or window when the pet is not in position or if Mama sees you throw food to a pet, she will bring 3 plates the next time. Remember, over nine plates on the table and it is arrivederci una vita (goodbye one life).

To clear a level, you must eat or toss a certain number of plates of pasta.
1=31
2=32
3=35
4=37
5=40
6=42
7=45
8=47
9=49

The point value of each plate of pasta starts at 5 at level 1 and increases by 1 point per level, to a maximum of 13 at level 9.
You get an extra life at every 1,000 points. The highest points you can reach is 9,999.</desc>

The game has four scenes: fighting ships at day, fighting ships by night, fighting planes and ships by day, fighting planes and ships by night. You move left or right and press the button to fire. In the night scenes, you cannot see the ships or planes in the distance unless something explodes.

It takes three hits to sink your ship. You start the game with three battleships and can get a new ship every 5000 points. The enemy starts out with 9 battleships and 30 aircraft. These numbers will increase as the scenes change according to the following formula:

  Number of battleships: 9 + (N - 1) x 2
  Number of aircraft: 30 + (N - 1) x 2
  where N is the pattern number.

Game variations
The only selections are one or two player. The difficulty switches are not used.

Scoring
Top row of battleships: 80 points
Middle row of battleships: 70 points
Bottom row of battleships: 60 points
Enemy fighter: 80 points
Enemy torpedo: 30 points
Enemy bomb: 30 points

When Spectradog comes on the screen, you must jump over him by pushing the joystick to the upper right or upper left or he will make you lose one life. As the building gets higher, the kid will steal the ladder. When the brat appears on the screen, you must get off the ladder or you will fall and lose one life. When the building gets to be several stories high, you must be leery of staying on the very top as lightning may strike and lose you a life. When you lose a life, you drop any bricks you were carrying.

Once the building is complete, you go all the way up the ladder and push up to call the helicopter to take you to the next site. If the building is not correct, the helicopter will pick you up but then drop you near the edge of the screen, losing you a life. There are game selections for unlimited time but limited bricks and unlimited bricks but limited time.</desc>

		<desc>In Masters of the Universe, you control He-Man as he battles Skeletor in two different types of arcade action scenes. In the first part of the game, you control the Wind Raider flying towards Castle Grayskull. You have a limited amount of fuel with which to reach your destination, plus numerous fireballs will be flying around the screen trying to stop you and Skeletor will be running along the ground. The Wind Raider is equipped with bombs and guns which can be used to defend yourself from the fireballs, and also can earn bonus points if you can hit Skeletor. The second part of the game takes place on foot. When you've landed near the castle, He-Man needs to pursue Skeletor. Skeletor will be firing numerous lightning bolts which can be blocked with a shield. There is a time limit here, and you must get past all of the screens and catch Skeletor before time runs out. If you are successful, the game will repeat at a tougher skill level.</desc>

Each player controls a cop that starts on the left, and the first player to make it out the exit on the right wins. The game also includes of variety of options. The maze can be completely visible, completely invisible, or have just a few parts invisible. With invisible mazes you can optionally have the computer provide a sneak peak at the complete maze periodically. To make your task more challenging, one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are caught by one of the robbers, you will momentarily be stunned giving your opponent an advantage. You can also give your cop the ability to set up a blockade to confuse your opponent. This will look like a regular wall, however you can walk straight through it. The games speed can also be adjusted, from calculatingly slow to extremely fast.</desc>

		<name>Mega Force</name>
		<desc>You are a member of MegaForce and have been sent to the city of Sardoun. Sardoun is under attack and you must defend it. You are armed with the Moto-Fighter, a sort of armed motorcycle with flight ability.

When you are on the ground, your missiles fire down and forward, at an angle. When you are in the air, your missiles fire straight ahead.

The object is to destroy enemy fighters, destroy or avoid ground-launched rockets, destroy fuel depots and destroy the enemy headquarters. Any enemy fighters that get past you will head to Sardoun and bomb a building. You will see a red flash at the top of the screen with the words "Defend" when Sardoun is in trouble.

Every second you are playing, you use one gallon on fuel. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. You can shoot fuel tanks to replenish. If you destroy all the tanks of that depot, a prize will appear that you can shoot (but may not want to). See "Prizes" for details. Each tank destroyed is worth eighty points and ten gallons of fuel.

Each enemy fighter destroyed is worth 100 points.
Each ground rocket destroyed is worth 300 points.
Each tower of the enemy headquarters destroyed is worth 300 to 600 points. If you get them all, you get one more point.
Each tower of Sardoun destroyed is worth 100 to 400 points and ten gallons of fuel each BUT if all the towers are destroyed, you will not be able to get any more points that round and will lose a life at the end of that round.

Prizes
---------
Missile=300 points and ten gallons of fuel
Moto-fighter=300 points and ten gallons of fuel
Enemy fighter=100 points and 0 gallons of fuel *
Ground-launched rocket=70 points and 0 gallons of fuel *
Yellow palm tree=400 points and 20 gallons of fuel
Arrow=0 points and 0 gallons of fuel
Man=600 points and 20 gallons of fuel +

*=If you shoot the enemy fighter or ground-launched rocket prizes (not the enemies), it will add 7 enemy fighters and 3 ground-launched rockets to the screen, so it is not recommended.

+=If you shoot the man prize, in addition to points and fuel, you will get an extra life.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/MegaMania - A Space Nightmare (USA).a26</path>
		<name>MegaMania : A Space Nightmare</name>
		<desc>In Megamania, the gameplay resembles that of Space Invaders. Rather than being aliens or spaceships, however, the enemies in this game are various objects such as hamburgers, bow ties, and steam irons. The object is to shoot them down before the energy bar at the bottom of screen is depleted, all while avoiding the oncoming enemies and their own projectiles attacks. Each of the enemies fly in select patterns and as soon as they hit the bottom of the screen, they re-appear at the top until shot by the player. The player's spacecraft depicted in the game is a cross between the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon battlecruiser from the Star Trek universe.
Gameplay-wise and in terms of graphics, MegaMania bears a very strong resemblance to Sega's 1981 arcade title "Astro Blaster". Both games feature nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an "Energy" meter. Also, the player's ship bears a remarkable similarity in both games.

When Megamania was originally sold, anyone who scored above 45,000 points could send Activision a picture of their screen and become an official Megamaniac. They also would receive an Official Megamaniac emblem.[2]
If a player exceeds a score of 999,999 the game ends.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Meltdown (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Meltdown</name>
		<desc>Not to be confused with the Atari game by the same name (which was released for the 7800), Meltdown was one of the final 20th Century Fox titles to be developed but was never released. Although Meltdown was displayed at the 1983 CES show, it was never seen again after the show closed.
Meltdown is basically a game of hide and seek that place on a 4x4 grid of atoms.  At the start of each round you will see a rogue quark move about the reactor agitating the atoms.  Each time the quark touches one of atoms it will strip off some of the electrons and atom will shrink.  Once an atom has lost all it's electrons it will become unstable, if all the atoms destabilize the reactor will blow!
As the only remaining scientist, it is up to you to destroy the quarks and cool down the reactor.   To accomplish this you will have to make use of the only two tools at your disposal: an atomic stabilizer and Cadmium rods.  When the quark jumps to an atom you must line up the stabilizer (on the X axis), line up the Cadmium tube (on the Y axis), and quickly insert a Cadmium rod by pressing the fire button.  However as soon as you destroy one quark another one appears to take its place, so be vigilant and don't let your guard down for a moment.
The core temperature is represented by a bar displayed at the top of the screen.  As the core cools down, the bar will grow longer, once the bar reaches the center of the screen the reactor will come back under control and the reactor will be saved. Each time you successfully save the reactor the action will get more intense; the number of quarks will multiply, they will begin to move faster, and the electrons will strip off more easily.
Meltdown is an simple, yet amazingly addictive game.  It's interesting graphical style and progressive difficulty ramping makes Meltdown a game that's hard to put down.</desc>

But there are other insects as well; spiders, bees, dragonflies and earwigs. Nature is dangerous. Luckily, there's a bug zapper that can shoot arrows at these insects and destroy them.

Millipede is the sequel to Centipede, and features similar gameplay, but with a new swarm of insects! The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen. When all millipede segments have been destroyed, the player will progress to the next, more difficult level. Millipedes and other creatures are all worth a different amount of points. Occasionally dynamite will appear on the screen, which will explode if shot by the bug zapper. With a well timed shot, numerous millipede segments (and other insects as well) can be taken out as they pass by.</desc>

		<name>Miner 2049er Volume II</name>
		<desc>Bounty Bob has tracked Yukon Yohan into Nuclear Ned's uranium mine. Bob must 'claim' each section of each part of the mine...but cannot take too long in each area, or the radiation will kill him.

Taking the role of Bob, players must traverse through different types of areas inside the nuclear mine. In the first level, "Lift", Bob must walk on each part of the screen to 'claim' it. Avoid the monsters by jumping over them or grab an old miner possession to become energized and grab a mutant for points. Use the lift to reach the higher parts of the screen.

The next area is the Crusher, with the same goal as Lift but more challenging as the player must also avoid getting crushed. The last part is the Radioactive Waste, where the goal is again the same, but the player must maneuver Bob around the radioactive waste. In each screen, there is a timer in the upper right. If this timer reached zero before you claim all sections, you lose a life.

After you have beaten all three screens, they repeat but without any of the bonuses for energizing, so you must jump over or avoid all mutants.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Mines of Minos (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Mines of Minos</name>
		<desc>You are the last mining robot on the Minos mine. Monsters have destroyed all your comrades.

As the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare parts to make more robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or blow them up with a bomb. After a few seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb at a time. If a monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze.

To deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any level. To move to another level, hold your joystick button down while moving through the tunnels on either side. You can also use these tunnels, without holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side of the maze to avoid monsters.

To win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters to kill them. You will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will destroy you and the monster.

In two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the robot runs into the monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. However, by pushing the joystick button, player two can switch to another monster, allowing the robot to run into an uncontrolled (and therefore deadly) monster.

Difficulty switches
Left switch for the robot, right for the monsters.
Set to A to make half speed, B for normal speed.

		<path>./No-Intro/Miniature Golf ~ Arcade Golf (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Miniature Golf : Arcade Golf</name>
		<desc>This is a computer game simulation of a Miniature Golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance.  As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the "cup."  Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.

Rather than a full 18 holes, this Miniature Golf variation has a nine-hole half-course.  Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup.  The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes.  While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it.  So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole.

Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Miss Piggy's Wedding (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Miss Piggy's Wedding</name>
		<desc>Miss Piggy's Wedding was a two-player game created in 1983 for the Atari 2600 console. The game was advertised in Atari catalogs, but never made it to final release, due to Atari's cancellation of their Children's series. A prototype of the game was discovered in the late '90s by a private collector.



The object of the game was for one player to maneuver Kermit through the church and outside to a waiting taxi, without getting caught by Miss Piggy (controlled by the second player), who insisted that they be married.



The obstacles to Kermit were the wedding guests (represented by blocks in the picture), who try to impede his progress through the maze. He also must touch a key in order to open the doors and escape, although if Miss Piggy touches the key, the doors close again.



The most complete version currently known for this game was never finished, so the consequences of Kermit escaping or being caught by Miss Piggy are unknown. Additionally, Gonzo appears at the top of the screen as the minister, yet he has no purpose in the game prototype.</desc>

The gates consists of 2 poles of the same color: either red or blue of which the objective is to ski between those poles.

The game consists of 9 different courses as well as 2 different difficulty settings (novice and expert). In the novice setting you will be penalized 5 seconds for each gate you miss, the expert setting however automatically disqualifies you if you miss a gate (although you still can complete the run).

There also is no limit to the number of players that can play, but only the fastest time will be shown on the screen.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Monster Cise (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Monster Cise</name>
		<desc>The history of this game is a bit of mystery.  According to the copyright message its part of the Children's Computer Worshop series (the Sesame Street series), but its part number (CX-26131) and late copyright date (1984) are well outside the Children's Series range (CX-26101 - CX-26115).  Atari may have been planning some kind of series for young children and infants in order to reach as wide an audience as possible.  There is evidence of this as prototypes for other children's games such as Peek-A-Boo and Honker Bonker fall into this part number range.  This prototype even uses the Kid's Controller, which further supports this theory.

The only known version of Monstercise is rather incomplete, and much like Grovers Music Maker, there's actually very little gameplay involved.  The screen displays a group of monsters doing what appear to be Jumping Jacks.  At the bottom of the screen is a blue blob (which is assumed to be Cookie Monster) holding a spotlight.  Pressing the # or * buttons on the Kids Controller will cause Cookie Monster to move left or right, and when you get underneath a monster the spotlight will shoot a beam and highlight the monster.  Once the monster is highlighted, you can control his (its?) head, arms, or legs by pressing the the keys on the keypad.  Each body part seems to have two different actions (three if you count not doing anything).  The head can blink or nod up and down, the arms can either flap or pump up and down, and the legs can kick out or squat.  After awhile the whole thing begins to look like a creepy exercise video, which may be where the name came from.
 
 
Needless to say the market for children's games was almost non-existent in 1984, as the videogame industry was crashing fast.  Monstercise was probably scrapped due to lack of a market for such a game, or even possibly because of the gameplay was too similar to Grover's Music Maker (which was also not released).  Many game ideas which sound good for demo never evolve enough to be turned into full fledged games, and Monstercise may have suffered this fate.  It's unknown if any more work was ever done on this title.</desc>

		<desc>In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

		<desc>Motocross is a motorcycle racing game viewed from a top-down perspective. The player rides a bike against an endless number of opponents on a straight road, trying to avoid running into them. In addition, the player has to watch the amount of gas left in the tank. The fuel gauge can be restored by driving over fuel cans. The goal of the game is to overtake a specified amount of bikes. Once this is accomplished, a new "scene" starts, and the difficulty is increased.</desc>

		<desc>Motocross Racer is a bike racing game where you need to race through three different scenes in the shortest amount of time possible. Each scene takes place in a different location with a different perspective. First you will race through the desert with a 3-D behind the bike point of view. Rocks, cacti, scorpions, and other obstacles should be avoided or you'll crash and lose valuable time. Next you'll race a winding path uphill through the woods. This section has a top down view, and you'll lose time if you wander off the track or crash into obstacles. The final segment of the race takes place on the beach with a side scrolling point of view. Various obstacles and other racers will all get in your way here! If you crash too many times, or take too long the game will be over.</desc>

		<name>MotoRodeo</name>
		<desc>This is a monster truck race that features true split screen action on an Atari 2600.

First, you move the joystick(s) up or down to select if this opponent will be a human player or computer, a blazer or a truck and whether it will have tires or trax. Tires allow you to go over obstacles easier, trax make you bounce higher. Then on the next screen, you select weather you are going to do a competition at hard, medium or easy or whether you are going to practice one of the obstacles in the game.

Press the joystick button to accelerate. Move the joystick down to do a wheelie when on the ground. Move the joystick left and right when in the air to control your spin. Move the joystick left and right quickly to escape mud bogs. Press the joystick button and push forward to use a nitro burst if you collected them.

Difficulty switches
Only the left switch is used.
 Set it to A for a scoring game in which the player with the most points at the end of the race wins.
Set it to B for a timing race in which the first player across the finish line wins.

Scoring
If the difficulty switch is set to A, the scoring is as follows:
Landing upright and flat from a jump=5 points
Hit a wall=10 points
Crush a car=20 points
Bounce on truck tires on the platform=25 points
Jump to a collapsed ramp=25 points
Touching 50 on the screen=50 points
Finish the race first=100 points</desc>

		<desc>Deep within a multi platformed diamond mine is a valuable crown. Your goal is to locate and retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!</desc>

Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</desc>

You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles. 

There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. 

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</desc>

The first step is taming the eagle that will carry Mr. Postman to his destination. This is done by climbing a tree on the far right edge of the screen, jumping onto a swinging vine and finally dropping onto the eagle's back, all while avoiding the bird's "droppings." Now, there are many things the nondescript white squares emanating from the eagle could be, and what exactly they are isn't important. What is important is that getting hit by one costs a life. So don't get hit by one. Oh, and while all this is happening your score is counting down at a pretty rapid clip, so no dilly-dallying.

Once you've secured your steed it's time to ride him (or her) through a thunderstorm, shooting hailstones while avoiding streaks of lightning. Once you clear the skies of hail three times you finally reach your destination, the City of Silence. Here you navigate through tight passages to deliver your package to its grateful recipients. Just like the first screen, your score ticks down rapidly here, so you'd better step on it.</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-man</name>
		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

The Music Machine moves back and forth at the top of the screen, dropping symbols that represent good qualities (Fruits of the Spirit). You have to catch these in you basket. Once you have caught one of each of the other symbols, then the heart (representing love) comes down. You MUST catch the heart to end the round and go to the next round. If you miss the heart, you lose a life.

Just under the Music Machine is Mr. Pims. He tries to mess you up by dropping down his assistants, the Pudgeons. If you catch a Pudgeon, you lose a life.

While sneaking around the museum, players have to avoid dogs and guards. The guards appear in the windows from time to time and can be avoided by standing between two windows. A new floor can be reached by running to the end of the current one and jumping through the hole.

		<desc>You have just discovered some buried treasure at the bottom of the sea, and now you have to protect it! You control a diver at the bottom of the screen, and there is a giant octopus and killer shark you need to deal with. Each time an octopus tentacle touches the bottom of the screen, or the shark catches you some of your treasure will be lost. To deal with these creatures, your diver has a harpoon. You need to make sure that you shoot the shark before it can make it's way to the bottom of the screen and catch you (the shark will appear again at the top of the screen each time it is shot.) The octopus' tentacles will be reaching downward; each time a tentacle is shot it will retreat back to the top so you need to keep shooting the tentacles before one can reach the bottom. Of course, your diver has a limited air supply. Your companion is in a boat on the surface, and will occasionally drop an air line down. You need to catch this to replenish your air before it runs out (if you run out of air, some treasure will be lost). The game ends when you have lost all of your treasure.</desc>

		<desc>Night Driver is an action racing game which takes place at night! Your goal is to score as many points as possible by racing through one of four different tracks. Points are scored by passing checkpoints located throughout the track. If your car crashes into the side of the road, oncoming cars, or any other obstacles, you will lose all of your speed and a lot of time! The game ends when the 90 second time limit is up. The four tracks you can choose from are beginner, pro, expert, and random (this track is different every time and can not be memorized like the other three). Several game options are included which allows you to select whether or not other cars will honk before entering the screen, and choose between a 90 second or infinite amount of time for a game.</desc>

		<name>Obélix</name>
		<desc>A classic Asterix &amp; Obelix game where you simultaneously play as (both) Asterix and Obelix maintaining their favorite Gaulish sport of thumping the living daylights out of Roman soldiers.

The objective of the game is to help Asterix "stun" Roman soldiers (simply by running into them, and they turn white from blue) while you command good ol'Obelix to throws his oversized Menhirs down at stunned Romans with a splat.

If by any chance a stunned soldier is not whacked by a flying menhir, they turn "red" and hostile, which means Asterix is in trouble. In any case, he needs some good ol' magic potion from Getafix in order to defeat the "red" Romans, so be ready to catch some when Getafix comes knocking.

There are 2 types of Roman soldiers to thump: the fat legionnaires and the small centurions. Centurions are worth more points.</desc>

		<name>Off the Wall</name>
		<desc>Off The Wall is an arcade action game with Breakout style gameplay. You control Kung Fu Lu, whose mission is to destroy a mysterious, evil wall by reflecting a bouncing ball into the bricks that make up the wall. When the bricks are hit by the ball, they are destroyed. On the top of the screen is a mystical dragon which guards the wall. Each level can be completed by either destroying all of the bricks in the wall, or hitting the dragon six times with the ball. Once the first level is completed, a blackbird will also appear on screen just below the wall. The blackbird will deflect the ball, and tries to get in the way to make your mission more difficult. From time to time, a magic token will fall downward which gives you special powers if caught. These can make the ball magnetic and follow your player, give you a larger paddle, or make the ball explosive and take out larger chunks of bricks. You start the game at a skill level of Peasant, and advance in rank every time four waves of bricks are cleared. You lose a life every time the ball falls off the bottoms of the screen, and the game ends when you lose all five of your lives.</desc>

		<name>Omega Race</name>
		<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game.  You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you.  Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too.  The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game.  Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship.  The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire.  Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters.  While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement.  When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces.  You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>

		<name>Oscar's Trash Race</name>
		<desc>It is the Grouch Day Picnic and three little grouches (Herman, Grungetta and Sloppy) want to win the Trash Race.

Game one is a practice race. The trash truck dumps one to five items. One of the trash cans at the top will then have a number on it. Press the button on the controller for that can the use the arrow keys to move it to the trash. Once you get the trash, move the grouch back to the top. You get one point per race. There are three races per game then Oscar appears to congratulate the winner (in his own grouchy way).

Game two is the same as game one except there will be a number on all three trash cans and you must select the one that corresponds to the number of items.

Both games one and two are one player only.

In games three and four, the truck dumps one to nine items. You again select the correct grouch but this time there are puddles, three in game three, several in game four. You get one point for each puddle you jump. If you step into a puddle, the grouch will play in it, delaying you. There are three races in game three, five in game four.

In game five, you run races one after another until Slimey the inchworm gets from one side of the screen to the other. Once Slimey get to the other side, the races ends. There are several puddles. You get one point per puddle jumped and one point per race completed.

Games six and seven are the same as five but it will rain sometimes. When it does, the puddles turn blue. If you jump a blue puddle, you get two points.

The trash items are:
bones
hangers
coffee mugs
toothbrush (presumably used)
old tin can
old televisions
old ten-gallon hats
old telephones
old tennis shoes
old dress shoes
junk mail
scissors
old toy boats
hammers
beach balls

For ages three to seven.</desc>

		<name>Out of Control</name>
		<desc>This is an obstacle race in a space ship. The ship controls in a rather Asteroids-like way, in that you push left or right to rotate and press fire to thrust. Once you stop thrusting, the ship does not immediately stop, although it will slow down on its own. To stop sooner, you have to face away from the direction you are traveling and thrust.

First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you must pass on the side indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must pass in between them. If there are three, you can pass through them or go around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last successfully passed hurdle and do it again to continue.

After the hurdles, you must pop ten space balloons by running in to them. They appear one at a time at random spots on the screen. After you pop all ten balloons, you must dock in the space dock to end the race.

The difficulty switches are not used. You select your game variation by moving the joystick up or down.

Game variations
There are 28 variations. The odd numbered ones have fast maneuvering, the even numbered ones, slow.

The number of hurdles also varies. The first two have 10 hurdles, the next two, 14, then 22 (twice), 27 (twice), 35 (twice), 39 (four times), 47 (twice), 51 (twice), 54 (twice), 63 (twice), 64 (twice), 72 (twice), and 82 (twice).</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Outlaw ~ Gunslinger (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Outlaw : Gunslinger</name>
		<desc>You're a gunslinger in the old west! Outlaw features both one and two player games. In the one player version, your goal is to shoot a moving target as many times as possible in 99 seconds. In the two player version, each player tries to be the first to shoot his opponent ten times. Several game variations are included in both the one and two player versions. In the middle of the screen is one of several possible obstacles to make the game more difficult. A giant cactus, a stagecoach, a moving stagecoach, or a breakable wall all can block the target or provide some shelter for you to hide from your opponents shots. You also have the choice of unlimited fire, or only a six shooter. If you choose the six shooter, then each player must use up all six shots before either player can reload. And lastly, there is the "getaway" option. With getaway, a player may move immediately after firing; without getaway, a player must remain stationary for as long as his bullet is on the screen.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Pac-Man (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<name>Party Mix : Bop a Buggy, Tug of War, Wizard's Keep, Down on the Line,</name>
		<desc>This tape contains five two or four player games in one package. They are:

Bop a Buggy: Drive your buggy through the course fastest to the finish line. Watch out for the buggy boppers, as they will throw bricks at you, slowing you up. In a two player game, each player controls a buggy and the computer controls the buggy boppers. In a four player game, two players control a buggy apiece and the other two control a buggy bopper apiece.

Tug of War: Simply pull the other team over the center line. In a  two player game, each player control an entire team, each. In a four player game, each player controls one of the four  players.

Wizard's Keep: Use the power of magic to destroy more targets for points than the opposing team. In a two player game, each player controls a pair of wizards. In a four player game, each player controls one wizard apiece. Note: Even though the screen in split, all wizards are shooting at the same targets so when a target is shot in one window, it will disappear in both.

Down on the Line: You must get a package from the left conveyor belt and pass it to the second worker who will then move it to the belt on the right that matches the package color. The game clock starts at 8:00 and the game ends when the clock reaches 5:00. In a two player game, each player controls a pair of workers. The package will pass from one worker to the other automatically. In a four player game, each player controls one worker apiece and must use the fire button to pass the package as well place it on the conveyor belt.

Handcar: A race to the finish line using railway handcars. In a two player game, each player controls one of the men on a handcar, the other works with him automatically. In a four player game, each player controls one of the men on both handcars.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Peek-A-Boo (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Peek-A-Boo</name>
		<desc>According to Atari, Peek-A-Boo was to be a revolutionary new video activity based on the familiar concepts of Peek-a-Boo and Hide 'n' Seek.  It was supposed to teach important concepts such as spatial orientation, direction, and memory that build a child's self-esteem and teach them to have fun on the 2600.
Since Peek-A-Boo was intended for very young children the gameplay is very simple.  The main character of this game (a cat named Smart Seymour) moves in and out from behind a square.  Depending on the game selected the various elements of the game change slightly.  The square may be a single block, a rectangle, or four colored squares.  The cat may move far away from the square, or he may barely move half his body out.  The cat may move rapidly in and out from behind the square, or he may stay behind the square.  There are eight different types of games, each with a slightly different objective.
Before starting the game, the first thing you must do is turn the kids controller sideways to the left (so the top row read 3 6 9 #, middle row reads 2 5 8 0, and bottom row reads 1 4 7 *).
-Game 1: Single BlocknnThis is the easiest of all the games.  All of the buttons work to move Seymour behind the block or out from behind it in various directions.
-Game 2: Horizontal BarnnIn this game the top row of buttons (3 6 9 #) moves Seymour up, the bottom row (1 4 7 *) moves Seymour down, and the middle row (2 5 8 0) gives you an error sound.  As with all the other game variations, all of the buttons work to move Seymour behind the line.
-Game 3: Vertical BarnnIn this game buttons 1 2 3 4 5 6 move Seymour to the left while buttons 7 8 9 * 0 # move him to the right.
-Game 4: Single BlocknnIn this game buttons 6 and 9 move Seymour up, 4 and 7 move him down, 1 2 3 moves him left, and * 0 # moves him right.  Buttons 5 and 8 give the error sound.
-Game 5: Four BlocksnnIn this game you have to press the right buttons depending on which block Seymour is behind.  Buttons 3 and 6 move him from behind the top left block, 9 and # move him from behind the top right block, 1 and 4 move him from behind the bottom left block, and 7 and * move him from behind bottom right block.  All of the middle buttons 2580 give the error sound.
-Game 6: Four Colored BlocksnnIn this game the buttons are assigned different colors that correspond to the colored blocks.  Buttons 1 2 3 moves Seymour from behind the green block, 456 for the red block, 7 8 9 for the tan block, and 0 * # moves Seymour from behind the blue block.
-Games 7 &amp; 8: 4 Blocks/4 Colored BlocksnnThese last two games are a bit of a mystery.  Hitting any button moves Seymour in various directions and only the two middle buttons (5 and 8) give the error sound when moving him out from behind the blocks.  Perhaps these games aren't finished or you need the mind of a child to understand them (you'd think I'd be qualified for that).
Peek-A-Boo holds a minor place in Atari history as being the first video game designed with a psychologist.</desc>

		<desc>The Pharaoh's Curse, or simply Pharaoh's Curse, is a 1983 platform adventure game written by Steve Coleman and published by Synapse Software for the Atari 8-bit family. It was ported to the Commodore 64 and VIC-20. In Pharaoh's Curse the player attempts to collect 16 treasures from an Egyptian tomb while avoiding the pharaoh, his mummy, and various traps. Coleman also wrote Rainbow Walker for Synapse, published the same year.

John Szczepaniak, writing for GamesTM magazine, called The Pharaoh's Curse an early example of what later became known as the Metroidvania genre.</desc>

		<name>Phaser Patrol</name>
		<desc>In Phaser Patrol you are the pilot of an interstellar spaceship on a mission to defend the Human Federation from the deadly Dracon armada. Gameplay is similar to Star Raiders. You begin with a view of the sector map, and need to warp to a sector where the Dracon are located. Once you've reached your destination, the game switches to a first person point of view where you need to destroy all enemy fighters located in the sector. Once the sector is cleared, you can return to the sector map and warp to a new location. The mission is successful when all sectors containing enemy fighters have been cleared. Your ship has a limited amount of energy; energy is depleted by warping to new sectors, or by taking damage from enemy fighters. If your energy runs out the game is over, however you can recharge your ship by visiting one of the friendly starbases that are located throughout the galaxy (visiting a starbase will also repair any equipment that has been damaged, such as the photon torpedoes or sector scanner).  The game is timed, and the faster you can complete your mission the better your ranking at the end will be!</desc>

		<desc>You are out enjoying a picnic, when suddenly a swarm of flies arrive! You control a fly swatter at the bottom of the screen; your goal in this game is to protect your hamburgers (located on the left and right bottom of the screen) from the attacking flies. When a fly is close enough, it will stick out its tongue to eat the food. If you can swat the fly right when it has its tongue out, it will be knocked out and fall into your fly trap. When all of the flies have been knocked into the trap, you will then need to face a large super fly before the level is complete (be careful, it can eat your food fast!) After knocking out the super fly, you move on to the next round. The game ends when all of your hamburgers have been completely eaten.</desc>

		<name>Piece o' Cake</name>
		<desc>In Piece o' Cake you are a chef, and your goal is to successfully build cakes! At the bottom of the screen is a conveyor belt, and a platter will appear at the left side moving towards the right. You are at the top of the screen, and need to take cake layers from the oven and drop them onto the platter. The cake layers are different sizes, and you must drop them such that each layer is the same size or smaller than the one beneath it. After you have created a cake, you need to top it off with a cherry. If you are unable to successfully create a cake with the layers in the proper order and a topped with a cherry before the platter reaches the right side of the screen, it will fall off the conveyor and you lose a life. The different size cake layers come out of the oven randomly, so if you get a size you don't want it can be dropped off at the right side of the screen until a layer you do want appears. Although you can build cakes of different sizes, bonus points are earned for building a perfect cake consisting of one large layer, one medium layer, one small layer, and a cherry. As the game progresses, the conveyor will pick up speed to make cake building tougher.</desc>

		<name>Pigs in Space : Starring Miss Piggy</name>
		<desc>Now it's time for...PIIIIIIGS IN SPAAAAACE!!!

This game is really three smaller games. You select what to play to choosing which character you want.
For Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders.
While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to time, Gonzo flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for points also.

Scoring
Hitting a chicken on...
Row one=10 points
Row two=20 points
Row three=50 points
Row four=70 points
Row five=100 points
Hitting Gonzo=300 points
Destroying all the chickens=1000 point bonus

If you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't dawdle.

Scoring
Karate-chopping a meat ball=100 points
Boarding the Swinetrek=1000 points

If you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life.

Scoring
You get one point for every mile you get through the mine.
Hitting a Gonzoid=100 points
Escaping the mine=1000 points

The difficulty switches do nothing. The only game selections are one player or two player, alternating.</desc>

Poisonous frogs, eels, scorpions, bats and other hazards get in the way. Pitfall II is the sequel to Pitfall, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Planet of the Apes (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Planet of the Apes</name>
		<desc>The action takes place over several screens: Deserts; Forests; the Apes' Village; a River Crossing; Subterranean Caverns; and the climactic Statue of Liberty scene from the film. There are three different kinds of apes in this game: chimpanzees - these little guys are harmless and can be touched without fear; orangutans are a bit bigger and a lot more dangerous than the chimpanzees, touching them will get you captured; gorillas are the most dangerous of all the apes, not only can they capture you, but they can shoot at you as well.
You must keep an eye on your 'life energy' (which is diminished whenever you are shot) and 'escapes' (which allow you to escape the cages, but also cost you life energy). When the life energy hits zero, the game is over. In a worst-case scenario, you may get trapped in a cage after you've run out of escapes, unable to do anything but wait until the apes shoot you to death. Your ultimate goal is to reach the Statue of Liberty level, at which point your health and escape ability will be recharged, and the game starts over at a higher difficulty level.
-The Forest/The RivernnYou start out in a forest with several apes after you. You can shoot at the apes by pressing the fire button, but since they just keep on coming it's best to run for it. There are also pits scattered throughout the forest, falling into one of these pits will cause your life to deplete rapidly. Your goal is to cross the river to the south - only going south will bring you towards the Forbidden Zone. Touching the river isn't deadly, and you can move through without any trouble - it may be that the river was going to be deadly and a bridge put across it in the early prototype.
-The Village/PrisonnnIf you touched an Orangutan or a Gorilla you end up here. When captured, you're treated to a newly-added full-screen graphic of a man behind bars. You need to be extra careful in the village since the area is cramped, and there are lots of apes roaming around. It's very easy to escape and be captured again right away. You'll also want to escape from the cage as quickly as possible since the apes will constantly hit you while you're trapped in the cage. Moving south will bring you to the desert.
-The DesertnnAfter the village you'll encounter a large featureless desert (formerly the ?Forbidden Zone'). There are more apes here than in any other zone, so you'll have to be on your guard. Moving south will bring you to the caverns.
The CavernsnnThe caverns are the last obstacles on your way to the human stronghold. There are no apes to worry about in the caverns, but unfortunately the caverns are a giant maze. You'll also slowly loose life points as you traverse the caves. There are several ways out of the caves but not every exit will lead you to the stronghold. If you take the wrong path through the caves you'll end up back on the forest screen. Hurry, you are close to reaching your goal!
The Statue of LibertynnOnce you reach the Statue of Liberty there's a newly-added ending which is impressive. You'll also get a brief glimpse of the original ending, which looks pretty pathetic by comparison. The screen will begin to flash and you'll see the Statue of Liberty displayed while the background scrolls through all the screens you've crossed. After this you will start back at the forest screen on the next higher difficulty level. Each new difficulty level has a few changes: the apes will do an extra point of damage when they shoot you; the apes move faster; more apes appear on the screen at once and come out more often; the bonus points for reaching the Statue of Liberty increases by 100.</desc>

On the first screen, you must shoot swooping aliens while not getting shot by them. At some point, an alien will create a shield across the screen just above your ship that will require you to shoot holes through to destroy more aliens. Be aware, however, that the alien shots are not slowed at all and can still kill you.

On the second screen, you must shoot or avoid a phoenix(es) shots but the object is to shoot the alien in  the mothership above. You can also shoot the phoenix(es) themselves for points.

On the third screen, you must maneuver between parked ships, without hitting any, to dock at your spot at the top. Once you do this, the game goes to the first screen only harder.

There are game selections to choose to also play only the first, second or third screens, with each wave getting harder.</desc>

		<desc>This is a game of polo, played on horseback. You move your horse with the joystick. The mallet swings automatically and will always send the ball in the direction of the opposing goal. The object is simply to to get the ball through the opposing player's goal more than they get the ball through yours. Some game variations have the ball wrap around the screen, some make the ball bounce off the sides, some give each player one horse to control, some two apiece.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Pompeii (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Pompeii</name>
		<desc>Pompeii was one of the last titles announced by Apollo, but went unreleased when Apollo became one of the first 2600 game companies to fold in the wake of the crash.  From box art and a few brief descriptions we can surmise that the game revolved around an Indiana Jones like archaeologist who is trying to find treasures in the ruins of the ancient city of Pompeii.
Unfortunately the only prototype that's surfaced so far is very incomplete.  The background graphics are very well done and depict a smoldering volcano (Mt. Vesuvius) and two strange shapes on either side (treasures?).  Your character hardly looks anything like the Indiana Jones character depicted on the box, but since this is a prototype he may have been "Indyized" in later versions.  Your character does have some slight walking animation, but it's far too slow for how quickly he moves.  The brown columns on the playfield are really place holders for enemy creatures which had yet to be defined.
This prototype is little more than a movement demo.  Your character can walk around the bottom half of the screen, but if he gets to close to the top his head becomes truncated (an obvious programming glitch).  When your character walks over the column placeholders, a number (from 1 to 47) is displayed in hexadecimal notation in the lower right of the screen.  Pushing the left controller button will also make a hexadecimal number appear in the lower right corner (from 47 to 8E).
You can make the lava level rise by pressing the right controller button.  The lava pool can extend all the way to the middle of the screen, but once you start raising the lava level there's no way to bring it back down.  As usual, the lava has no affect on your player and he can safely stand in it all day.  Beyond the excitement of walking around and watching the lava rise, there isn't anything else to do in this prototype.
Its hard to judge a game based on such an early prototype, but from what's been implemented Pompeii was looking pretty good.  After several mediocre titles Apollo may have actually had a decent chance with this game, but the crash wouldn't wait for them to prove themselves.</desc>

		<name>Pooyan</name>
		<desc>In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>

She is at the top of the screen dropping tokens of her love, and you need to collect them before they hit the ground. After you have collected the required number of items, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. There are many obstacles trying to stop you from completing your task, though! Brutus wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect a can of spinach, you can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!</desc>

Porky catches you=lose 200 points
What points you get for exiting the scaffolding depends on the difficulty you have set the game to. The points are from 100 to 3200.

The Swamp

If you are sent to the swamp a second time, you can climb out right away but look out for Porky.

Place a brick=100 points
Getting out of the swamp screen=100 points
Each pole vault jump=lose 25 points
Falling into swamp=lose 100 points
Caught by Porky=lose a random number of points

Push the random object that appears at center, top into the pit at the bottom without getting caught by Ms. Balbricker or falling in the pit the climb out the top back to the county line. Every time you get through the shower, you stop or slow a lane on the highway.

You get 100 points for pushing an object into the pit.
You lose 200 points if you fall in the pit or are caught by Ms. Balbricker.
Every ten seconds you are in the shower, you lose ten points so don't dawdle.

		<name>Power Lords</name>
		<desc>Power Lords was based on the 1983 toy line of the same name. North American Phillips (NAP) must have thought that it was going to be a huge hit, because games were developed for the Atari 2600, Colecovision and Odyssey 2. Of these games only the Odyssey 2 version was released and is considered to be the rarest US released game for the system. All three versions play similarly, but the Atari 2600 and Colecovision versions have an additional stage which makes the game slightly more interesting. Like the other versions, the 2600 version of Power Lords is not all that fun to play and the overall difficulty of the game is also rather high. Had Power Lords been released, it probably would have ended up in the bargain bin faster than the action figures did.</desc>

Tomotoes, onions, lettuce, and cheese may all be requested and you need to collect the proper ingredients, put them on a hamburger, and drop it in the wrapping machine. The hamburgers will be coming down the left side of the screen on a conveyer belt as all other ingredients come flying out of the dispensers on the right. Make sure you catch all the ingredients and don't let any hamburgers fall off the end of the conveyer belt, otherwise you'll lose performance points! If your performance score drops to zero, you will be fired and the game ends. Of course, the ingredients will rarely come out in the desired order, so you also have the ability to toss an ingredient back without losing performance points if necessary. As you successfully create the ordered hamburgers and drop them in the proper warpping machine, the game difficulty will increase by upping the speed of the conveyer belt and increasing the complexity of the orders.</desc>

		<name>Private Eye</name>
		<desc>You are the great French private eye Pierre Touche. Your job is to capture the criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases, several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and how high you can jump.</desc>

		<name>Pursuit of the Pink Panther</name>
		<desc>Pursuit of the Pink Panther was based off the famous cartoon series and inspired by the Pink Panther movies starring Peter Sellers as inspector Clouseau. This game actually started out life as Trail of the Pink Panther by U.S. Games (based on the then current movie), but when U.S. Games went out of business they sold the rights to North American Phillips (NAP) who decided to release their own version of the game through their Probe 2000 division. It is unknown if any work was already done on the U.S. Games version or if any of those ideas were used in the Probe 2000 version of the game. Although Pursuit of the Pink Panther was heavily marketed at the June 1983 CES, it was never released, most probably because the special RAM/ROM chip that NAP used to squeeze all the graphics and gameplay elements into the game couldn't be reliably manufactured. When the first batch of chips came back defective from the manufacturer NAP decided to cancel the game rather than try and find a new source for the chips. The crumbling game market at the time was also a big factor in choosing not to go forward.</desc>

		<name>Q*bert's Qubes</name>
		<desc>Q*Bert's Qubes is the sequel to the game Q*Bert and features similar gameplay, but is now in three dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.</desc>

		<desc>Quadrun is an arcade style action game for one player. The planet of Quad has been invaded, and all of the "Runts" are imprisoned; your goal is to rescue them! The screen is broken up into four sectors (one on each edge of the screen), with the prison in the center. Your character is equipped with three phaser balls; on the screen you will see the captors running up and down vertically, and you need to hit them with a phaser ball. When hit, the captor will be destroyed and one of the Runts will be able to escape. The Runts will run back and forth horizontally, and you need to catch them before they run into the deadly wall at the edge of the screen. To make the game more challenging, you are only equipped with three phaser balls! This means after firing a phaser ball, you will need to quickly run around to the other side of the screen and catch it before it disappears. You will also lose a phaser ball if one of the captors collides with your character. Lose all three phaser balls, and the game is over. Also, there is a critter counter at the top of the screen; if you fail to destroy one of the captors or if one of the escaped Runts runs into a wall, the critter counter will decrease. If the critter counter runs out, the game ends.</desc>

		<name>Quest for Quintana Roo</name>
		<desc>You are Yucatan Sam on a quest to explore the temple of Quintana Roo. Your goal is to find the vault which is hidden somewhere within and return with the treasure that is inside. You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Quick Step! (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Quick Step!</name>
		<desc>In Quick Step a kangaroo and squirrel are competing against each other to earn points by jumping on trampolines. The screen is made up of an array of trampolines which scroll downward. As trampolines appear at the top of the screen, they will be grey in color; as soon as it turns pink, the trampoline is now in play. Each time a critter jumps on a trampoline, the color will change to that critters color (green for the kangaroo, or blue for the squirrel). If you jump on a pink trampoline, 3 points are earned; when a trampoline falls off the bottom of the screen that is your color, 6 points are earned (so although no points are earned by jumping on your opponents color, you want to try to get as many trampolines as possible your color in order to earn points when they reach the bottom).  If you fall off of the bottom of the screen, a life is lost; the game ends when one player has no more lives left and whomever has more points wins. A few bonuses can also be found; if you see a white trampoline, that is a magic hat; collect it and then jump onto the same space as your opponent to temporarily stun him. Each player also begins the game with 6 tricky traps; pressing the button lays a trap causing the trampoline to disappear so no one can land there.   Each level in the game gets progressively faster; at the end of a level, there will be a single column of fast moving trampolines to jump up, so be careful!</desc>

		<desc>You are a rabbit who is just trying to get to where you can get a mate and make like a mathematician by multiplying. First you must get through the meadow and across the ledges without losing life and limb.

You start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game start back at the beginning only harder.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Racer (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Racer</name>
		<desc>Racer was an original game developed by Roklan for Atari (their first actually), and not based on any existing arcade game.
Roklan was a major 3rd party developer of games back in the 80's, however Roklan generally did not publish games under their own name, so most never knew they existed.
Racer was Roklan's first title for the Atari 2600, and as such, is a rather simple game.  The player controls a car which they must maneuver around the screen and avoid crashing into the walls.  The screen scrolls downward, so you are constantly moving forward.  As such there is no gas button, nor is there a brake button.  All you can do as hang on and dodge those walls!
At the start of the game, the walls move rather slowly.  In fact it is almost impossible to crash into a wall unless you're trying to do it on purpose.  However about every 30 seconds the game will speed up, and the walls will come faster and faster until they become unavoidable to anyone who isn't a Jedi.  This usually happens around the fifth speed up.
Each player starts with three lives, with extra lives being awarded every 30 points.  There are ten different game variations, each one changing the number of players and the speed at which the game starts.  The last two variations are a sort of 'Children's Mode' where the game starts at the slowest speed and never speeds up.
Although the one player version of Racer is rather ho-hum, the game really shines in the two player modes.  Unlike most Atari 2600 games, Racer offers two player simultaneous play.  In the two player variations you and a friend square off against one another in an attempt to get the highest score.  Each player can stay on their side of the screen and try to beat the other player purely based on skill, but why would you want to do that?  The best part of Racer is that you can bang and crash into the other player, forcing them into the oncoming walls.  Of course the other player can do the exact same thing back to you, so be careful.  Careful strategy is needed when deciding what the right time is to ram your car into the other player.
While Racer is an alright game, it lacks long term playability.  The one player game is too simple and ends too quickly, and the two player game isn't much more interesting.  It was probably for this reason that Atari declined to pick up Racer, and Roklan didn't try and put it out themselves.  Racer has potential, but it needs more variation to make it interesting (different wall layouts, an enemy car , power ups, etc.).  Still, Racer is a rare and interesting glimpse into the secret lives of third party developers.</desc>

		<desc>You have been challenged, or maybe you challenged, someone to a game of racquetball.

To serve, press the red button. You hit the ball by moving your player to where the shadow of the ball is about level with your feet. The racquet will swing automatically. When you serve, the ball must hit the front wall before it hits the floor. Your opponent can then hit the ball before it lands on the floor or he can let it bounce but you can only let it bounce once. It cannot bounce twice. You serve every time until you miss. If you are serving and your opponent misses, you get one point. You can only get points on rounds where you serve. First player to twenty-one points, wins.

Difficulty switches
A=Shots accuracy is more difficult to control
B=Shot accuracy is easier to control.</desc>

		<name>Raiders of the Lost Ark</name>
		<desc>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!</desc>

		<desc>EEEEEK! Green is going wild! Red on your right! Blue at your back! Yipes, yellow! Quick! Jam it, slam it. Ram It! Put your Ramroid into action and rifle away.

You, the Ramroid, are on a track in the center of the screen. You can aim left and right to fire. On both sides are colored bars that begin to randomly advance towards the center. You must shoot these bars to drive them back, preferably off the screen. If a bar starts flashing, it is a bonus bar and shooting it gets you larger points as well as clearing it from the screen completely. Be warned, though, that sometimes the bar will reappear on the opposite side of the screen.

A round ends when:
1. You have cleared all the colored bars from the screen or
2. The timer at the bottom, which starts at five thousand, reaches zero or
3. The colored bars have blocked off part of the screen and you clear the rods where you can

After three rounds, the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>George, Lizzy and Ralph were just ordinary Americans, until an experiment went wrong, turning them into a Gorilla, Lizard and Werewolf respectively. Following this, the three of them plan to go round destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in.

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human</desc>

The player controls a type of flying saucer, his main objective is to reach the structure that moves in the corner of the screen. When touched correctly, the player will attach their ship to the structure, taking it to the next level.
In the middle of the path, the player will encounter various enemies, which may or may not be destroyed, depending on the player's desire for more points.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Reactor (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Reactor</name>
		<desc>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</desc>

Enter the squared circle to face off against a friend or a computer-controlled opponent. Throw quick jabs and hard body blows until there's only one man left standing.

Watch out for Lefty O'Leary's brutal technique. Beware Jabbin' Jack's lightning quickness. Players pummel their way up the ladder, each victory leading to a more challenging adversary, until their boxer makes it to the top. Proven pugilists can then defend the coveted championship against a slew of fierce contenders.</desc>

As in real football, the goal is to march down a 100-yard field using a combination of passing and running plays. There are three ways to score: crossing the defensive team's goal line is a touchdown worth seven points, kicking the ball through the defense's goal post is a field goal worth three points, and tackling the ball carrier inside the end zone is a safety worth two points.</desc>

		<name>Red Sea Crossing</name>
		<desc>Red Sea Crossing is a Christian video game for the Atari 2600 created by Steve Slack at Inspirational Video Concepts in 1983. The game has only two copies known to exist, making it one of the rarest video games in existence.

The game begins with Moses parting the Red Sea, with the goal of reaching the Sinai Peninsula. The player, taking on the role of Moses, then attempts to dodge various underwater obstacles such as seaweed and giant clams, as well as pursuing Egyptians. The gameplay is a side scrolling platformer, which sees the player as Moses jumping over obstacles to gain a higher score, which is displayed in black text at the bottom of the screen. When killed, the Red Sea closes returning it to its original state.

The game was published independently in 1983 and sold exclusively through advertisements in Christianity Today. According to the ad, the game was accompanied by a coloring book and an explanatory audio cassette narrated by Dale Evans Rogers.</desc>

Space pirates are in the area and the robot interceptors are working against us. Your orders are to fly your F-117 Starwarrior to Terra I, destroying anything that tries to harm you.

You can move your ship up, down, left or right. You begin with a top-down view if the F-117, facing towards the bottom of the screen. Meteors and later space pirates come from the bottom moving up and you must shoot them. After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields (yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped devices to destroy them. They are Terra I's last defensive line so when you get through them, you win.

In the two player games, player one controls the F-117's left and right movement and player two controls the up and down movement therefore players must work together. Firing alternates between both players in two second intervals.</desc>

		<desc>You must build three walls above the tomato plants at the bottom. You must also dodge tomato bombs shot by the tomato plants, shoot tomato vines that grow on any part of the wall, shoot cherry tomatoes (or just dodge their shots) and shoot or dodge beefsteak tomatoes.

To capture a brick, you shoot it once. Then to place it, you shoot vertically at the wall once. You cannot place bricks horizontally.

The game's default is level setting six, which has all enemies and each round is harder than the last. The level settings are as follows:
Level one: Tomato plants only and every round is the same difficulty
Level two: Same as one but adds beefsteak tomatoes
Level three: Same as two but adds cherry tomatoes
Level four: Same as three but adds brick-growing vines
Level five: Same as three but each round gets harder than the last
Level six:  Same as four but each round gets harder than the last
Level seven: Same as five but the tomato bombs are wider
Level eight: Same as six but the tomato bombs are wider.

When the left difficulty switch is set to B, you have unlimited lives. If set to A, you have four lives.
The right difficulty switch affects the game speed; A faster, B slower.

The points are:
Killing the beefsteak tomato=5 points
Killing the cherry tomato=50 points
Shooting the brick-growing vine=5 points
Capturing a brick=10 points
Placing a brick in a wall=20 points
Completing the first wall=1,000 points
Completing the second wall=2,000 points
Completing the third wall=3,000 points

You cannot complete an upper wall until the wall below it is complete.</desc>

Armed with a sling and a pile of rocks, the Prince must navigate past thieves and scorpions on his journey.  He can trade with wandering nomads, dig for buried treasure, make offerings to the gods, or seek counsel and healing with Isis, the goddess of fertility and motherhood.

Great care must be exercised in his journey, for the Prince can weaken from thirst, which can be be replenished at an oasis or from certain treasures.  He will also sustain wounds from the hostile creatures of the land, including Anubis himself.

Once the Prince visits the various temples of the desert and makes his offerings, he must choose to make the correct offering (or offerings) to the Temple of Ra.  Choose wisely, and the Prince is rewarded.  Choose poorly, and the Prince loses inner strength points, and Egypt remains cursed.</desc>

		<desc>You are captain of the boat trying to make it upriver while saving
the drowning people lost in one of the nine rivers.

You must guide your boat up the river without hitting the shore, rocks, driftwood, other boats or TNT, which will sink you immediately. You want to rescue as many drowning swimmers as you can. Your boat also has a leak so don't delay and keep an eye on you water gauge at the bottom. If that reaches zero, your boat will sink. You want to avoid alligators and whirlpools as, although they won't sink you instantly, they will cause you to take on water faster for a time.</desc>

		<name>River Raid</name>
		<desc>River Raid is a vertically scrolling action game. You fly a jet up a river in an attempt to destroy bridges which are vital to the enemy. The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.</desc>

		<name>River Raid II</name>
		<desc>You're the pilot of an F-14 assault jet, assigned to the dangerous mission of taking out an enemy bridge at the top of a heavily guarded river. In River Raid II, the gameplay is similar to the original River Raid, but with a few additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. After a successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean which guard the entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from the refueling jets, since once you reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next you will have to make your way up the treacherous river channel until you finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet, for now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After completing all of this, you move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to the expanded levels, another change in River Raid II is the ability to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above everything, or fly low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges.</desc>

		<desc>This game is based on an arcade game that was released by Atari.

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</desc>

		<desc>Robin Hood is an action game where you need to rescue Maid Marian who is being held by the Sheriff of Nottingham in a castle (and while you're at it, steal some gold to give to the poor)! Gameplay takes place on several different screens which have different objectives. First you will need to make your way through Sherwood Forest; numerous henchman are hiding here, so use your arrows to shoot them. Surviving the forest, the next section takes place outside of the castle; naturally, numerous henchman guard the castle gate. While dodging incoming arrows, you need to shoot enough of the henchman to cause the gate to open. Once it opens, you can enter the castle for the final scene. Inside the castle you will be able to find Maid Marian behind one of the many doors, and gold behind another. The rest of the doors have henchman hiding behind them, but if you can find the Maid Marian or the gold then you win this round and the game repeats at a tougher skill level.</desc>

		<name>Robot Tank</name>
		<desc>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Roc 'n Rope (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Roc 'n Rope</name>
		<desc>Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points. 

Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to "shake" the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.

There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies and power-ups located in different places.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle</name>
		<desc>According to the catalog entry: "Rocky and Bullwinkle must stop the evil Boris and Natasha from robbing a train full of priceless valuables. While Boris uses "Upsidasium" to float the valuables up to Natasha's waiting helicopter, Rocky must fly around and intercept them. When Rocky catches the valuables, he gives them to Bullwinkle for safe keeping."  Now I know the show didn't exactly make sense most of the time, but what heck were the guys over at Mattel smoking when they came up with this plot?


Twisted plot aside, Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle is an interesting action game in which you must fly Rocky around the screen grabbing all the valuables before they float up to Natasha.  R&amp;B sort of plays like Kaboom in reverse, and resembles Dumbo's Flying Circus in some respects.  Treasures can be snagged by flying Rocky over them and pressing the button, but since Rocky has puny little rodent muscles he can only hold two valuables at once.  While you can give any treasure to Bullwinkle for points, there is a special combination that is displayed on the screen, these are the two that actually count.  If you give these two treasures to Bullwinkle the screen will flash a bit and the timer will reset to 75, giving you more time to look for the next combination.  However there's another timer which constantly counts down no matter what you do.  When this timer runs out, the game ends.  This timer can be extended by selecting different game variations.</desc>

To advance, you must shoot the gunman when the portals are open. You can shoot the monster but it will only be stunned and if you stay in the same room too long, the monster becomes immune to your weapon.

There are sixty-four game variations. In some, the gunmen shoot in a straight line only, others they aim at where ever you are, others are slow, others fast, others the portals all open at the same time and stay open, others various portals open and close.

Scoring

You race along a five-lane freeway, in control of a car equipped with weapons, on a mission to destroy certain carrier cars which are causing traffic jams.  You must weave in and out of traffic at high speeds blasting slow-moving cars in your path to reach your destination.  Along the way, you must also avoid obstacles such as destroyed cars, barricades, nails, and  oil slicks on the road.  A radar tracks the enemy and warns of coming danger.

Collisions with other vehicles and objects will damage your car and cause malfunction.  The car will repair itself slowly as time lapses, or you may pull over for a quick repair, but you may let your target escape if you take too long.  You only have one car, and the game is over when this car is lost.</desc>

		<name>S.A.C. Alert</name>
		<desc>S.A.C. Alert (S.A.C. standing for Strategic Air Command) is the most complete of the five Amiga prototypes that have turned up, unfortunately it is also most uninteresting being quite similar to the M-Network game Air Raiders.
 After pressing select to choose between a ground or sea mission (the only difference being the color of the ?ground' and the type of enemies you encounter) you will be shown taking off on what has to be the shortest runway in the history of videogames.  Once you are in the air you must shoot at both air and ground/sea targets.  Of course the enemy targets will be shooting back at you, so you must dodge incoming bullets as well.
You start the game with three planes and 99 units of fuel.  Fuel acts like a timer in this game, and you will crash if it runs out.  In addition to a fuel gauge you also have altimeter showing how high above the ground you are (0 to 50).  Being higher lets you shoot down planes, while being lower lets you shoot ground targets).  Be careful though, if your altitude hits zero the ground will turn black and you will crash after a few seconds.   There are also two warning lights on either side of the status bar, these lights will alert you to different dangers.  They will flash red if you are too low to the ground (under 9), yellow if you're running low on fuel (under 20), and orange if you've taken heavy damage.
There are three types of enemies in the game.   Planes patrol the air and will swoop towards you, fire, and run off.  Taking these guys out is easiest when they're doing their swooping motion as they'll present the biggest target.  In addition to planes there are anti-aircraft guns (land) and destroyers (sea) that appear at the beginning of the game, but won't actually start firing at you until the third mission.   If you've taken too many damage you can attempt to land for repairs.  To land you need to fly low and look for either a runway (land) or carrier (sea) and line up with it.  Once you're low enough and lined up with the runway, pull up to land. It take a bit of getting used to, but it's not that hard after a few times.   Once you've lost all your lives you will be given a final ranking (crew, pilot, or ace) and rated on your performance (0-9).
Interestingly it appears that S.A.C. Alert was designed with the Joyboard controller in mind.  The Joyboard was an odd controller Amiga developed where the player stood on a plastic board that was supported on a little suction cup that stuck to the floor.  The idea was that the player would balance themselves and lean in the direction they wanted the character to move.  This worked far better in concept than in reality and makes most games impossible to play, even those designed for the Joyboard itself.  S.A.C. Alert is no different in this regard so it is not recommended that you break out the Joyboard, regardless of what the prototype box artwork says. Either the playtesters at Amiga had super human reflexes and balance, or they were just masochists.</desc>

		<name>Saboteur</name>
		<desc>You are Hotot, a cybernetic life form from a serene planet in a distant galaxy. Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.

On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.

In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you must destroy the warhead one-on-one.

In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course, the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Save Mary! (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Save Mary!</name>
		<desc>Save Mary! was one of those 2600 revival titles that should have been released but was ultimately lost when Atari closed its Atari 2600 operations in 1990.  Save Mary! may have been in development longer than any other Atari 2600 game (over two years according to some sources).  One reason for this was Atari management constantly making changes to an already complex game, but another reason for the long development cycle was that programmer Tod Frye (of Pac-Man fame) may only have been working part time for Atari at the time and was also working on another unreleased 2600 game Shooting Arcade.  No matter what the reasons were it's a shame Save Mary! never got released, as it's a fun and highly original game.
The game title says it all, the goal of the game is to "Save Mary!".  Apparently Mary is a rather stupid girl who has somehow got herself stuck in a canyon that's rapidly filling with water (don't you hate it when that happens?)  Using only a crane and several odd shaped blocks you must build a platform for Mary to climb onto and make it high enough so you can hoist her out with the crane.  However your task is made more difficult due to the shape of the blocks (otherwise it wouldn't be much of a game would it?).  Not all the blocks come in nice little squares, each level has its own unique set of blocks which require clever planning to successfully link them together into a platform for Mary.
Further complicating things is that Mary appears to have started panicking and will run back and forth around the platform.  Remember that Mary is human (despite the gaping hole in her head!), and like most humans she doesn't take kindly to being squished with blocks (or having them swung into her).  Take special care when dropping blocks not to hit Mary or it's game over.  Also be sure to watch out for the low flying airplane that appears on the higher levels (yes I said Airplane).  If the plane hits your crane you will automatically drop the block you're carrying (possibly squishing Mary).
Thankfully there are several power-ups to help you accomplish your task.  Power-ups appear on the cliff sides and require that you pick them up and drop them off at the top of the canyon to activate them.  These power-ups do a wide variety of things:

The Plug - Stops the water from rising for a few seconds
Stop Sign - Makes Mary stop hopping around like an idiot (very handy)
Oil Can - Makes your crane move faster
Gold Block - Makes Mary invincible to being squished by falling blocks
Number - Gives you bonus points
Mary Figure - Gives you extra life

Save Mary! tends to get tough fast if you don't learn how to make the most of the power-ups, and can quickly get out of control if you don't have a plan for how to stack the blocks.  Strategy and planning are the keys to winning Save Mary!, but taking too long will result in one waterlogged corpse.  Overall Save Mary! is a Tetris variant with enough variety to keep gamers coming back for more.  Atari had a winner on its hands, as Save Mary! was a game that could have made Atari owners say Wow!  Unfortunately the age of the 2600 was over and brilliant efforts like this ultimately came too late to save the dying system.  On an interesting side note Nolan Bushnell himself is quoted as saying that Save Mary! was one of his favorite upcoming Atari 2600 releases.  One would think that with this kind of endorsement Save Mary! would have seen the light of day.</desc>

		<name>Unknown Activision Game #1</name>
		<desc>Found in a salvage yard in 1998 by Ben Liashenko, the identity of this mysterious Activision prototype has eluded collectors for years. This prototype plays like a cross between a Rubik's Cube and the old sliding tile puzzle game. The goal of the game is to line up all the colors in each row from light to dark. If you've done it correctly the board should look like the start-up screen with the colors descending from red to purple. However lining up all the colors is easier said than done due to the unique way the squares move across the board.
When you move your square up or down a row or column, the last square in that row will move behind your square's new position. For instance if your square is the light green one (center of the row), and you move it left it will result in the last square in the row (the light blue one) moving behind it. If you move right instead, the last square on the right (the dark blue one) would move behind your square. Mastering how the squares move is essential to solving the puzzle. If you forget what order the squares should go in, pressing the fire button will cause all the squares in the correct positions to turn black. While this is helpful for positioning the shades of color in each row, it won't help you remember what color is supposed to go in each row.</desc>

		<name>Sea Hunt</name>
		<desc>You are diving for treasure in perilous waters infested with man-eating fish and vicious sea monsters!  You must be careful to choose just the right moment to dive into the water because you cannot defend yourself while you are diving.

As the game begins, you have four divers but can only control one at a time.  Each diver receives 60 seconds' worth of oxygen for every dive he makes.  Your only defense against the dangerous man-eating fish is a harpoon gun?use it well, for those fish are devious!  You must harpoon all of the fish in the water and enter the sunken Spanish galleon before another fish appears.

Once inside the galleon, you will be confronted by three vicious sea monsters who jealously guard the galleons's three treasure chests.  Your harpoon gun cannot help you now because the sea monsters are invincible.  You must swim quickly to avoid them!  Keep your wits about you as you dodge these clever monsters because they can trick you by passing right through the walls of the ship!  But you can escape them by entering one of the ship's many narrow passageways!

To retrieve the treasure chests filled with gold doubloons and valuable pieces of eight, you must reach the treasure and touch it.  But watch your oxygen level!  When the level is low, youmust return to your boat for more oxygen or drown.  And the way back to your boat is just as dangerous as the journey down because more man-eating fish await you in the waters between your boat and the sunken treasure ship!</desc>

		<desc>It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.

You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring.

Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.

Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen. Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy.

Weapon energy use and damage
Energy sword=1 energy and 2 strength
Sonic blaster=2 energy and 4 strength
Particle beam=4 energy and 8 strength.

		<desc>Sentinel is a side scrolling action game. Several worlds have fallen victim of an alien attack, and you need to free them. To do this, a glowing orb called the Sentinel has been sent which can absorb the alien energy. As the Sentinel floats above the various, scrolling landscapes, you need to protect it from attacks by using the light gun to destroy enemies and enemy fire. If you don't destroy an enemy, it will deplete the Sentinels energy supply which will eventually destroy it. There are four levels of increasing difficulty, each with a large boss at the end. To help out on your mission, several bonuses may be encountered from time to time; increased firepower and energy can be acquired when you shoot the bonus capsules that appear. Three levels of difficulty are available.</desc>

		<desc>Shootin' Gallery is a target shooting game similar to Sega's Carnival. You control a gun at the bottom of the screen while various types of targets move left and right above. Given a limited amount of ammo, you need to earn as many points as possible by shooting the targets (which include trains, snails, frogs, kangaroos, monkeys, and more). Naturally more points are awarded for targets that are further away or tougher to hit. At the top of the screen is a cuckoo clock which counts down; when time runs out, a cuckoo will eat some of your remaining ammo! To avoid this, the clock can be shot which resets the timer. Every 20,000 points bonus ammo is awarded. When all of your ammo is gone, the game is over and the score calculated.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Shooting Arcade (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Shooting Arcade</name>
		<desc>Shooting Arcade is one of only two 2600 games to use the light gun (Sentinel was the other), but was never released.  This is a shame because Shooting Arcade is a creative light gun target game similar to the Point Blank series, and would have been unique among 2600 games.  Interestingly it appears that Shooting Arcade was not developed in the US, but rather in Mexico by a company called Heuristica.  How Axlon was invovled is unknown, but they may have simply sub-contracted the game out to Heuristica instead of doing it themselves.
Shooting Arcade is really made up of six different scenes that are put together in different orders depending on the level you've selected.  Each scene has its own unique theme, rules, and objective, making Shooting Arcade essentially six games in one.  Depending on which skill level you choose, the scene's attributes change to make it more or less difficult and the timer at the bottom of the screen counts down more or less quickly.  The status bar at the top of the screen shows the number of shots you have left, your current difficulty level, and the number of targets left.  You start each level out with a limited amount of ammunition depending on the difficulty level (40, 10, 5, 2, or 1).  You can continue from the last screen you completed an infinite amount of times by simply pressing the reset button.  This is a handy feature as the game get very hard at the later levels...
The six scenes are:
Colored Squares - Here you must shoot out all the colored squares before the timer runs out.  Starting on level 1 if you shoot and empty area where a square would be, a new square appear and you'll have to shoot it again!  On level 4 the squares will all disappear after you take your first shot, and you must memorize where all the squares were before you start.  The squares can briefly be seen when you take a shot which helps a bit, but they will reappear if you shoot the same area twice (as in level 1).  Every square you successfully hit will give you two extra shots.
Shooting Gallery - This scene is reminiscent of Imagic's Shooting Gallery cartridge.  Here you must shoot various carnival targets such as glass pipes, ducks, milk jugs, colored squares, and dinosaurs?  The targets in the center area move at a fair clip (depending on the difficulty level) and the pipes at the top can be very difficult to hit making this scene one of the toughest in the game.  Speaking of squares, you can shoot the colored squares at the bottom of the screen to gain extra ammo if you're in need.  To clear this scene you must successfully shoot all the targets.
The Birds - This scene is only accessible from level 2 onward.  In this scene you must shoot all the black and white birds before the timer runs out.  The birds move with a up and down motion, but follow a specific path around the screen so you can predict where they will move.  The background will change from black to white during the course of the scene effectively camouflaging the birds making them even more difficult to hit.
Target Practice - This scene is one of the hardest to complete, since you begin with almost no ammo and the timer counts down lightning fast.  The concept of this scene is quite simple, you must shoot the various birds which fly around the screen.  Unlike the previous scene, these birds only appear one at a time and they move very very fast.  The birds will wrap around from one side of the screen to the other, so you can try and anticipate where it will appear next.  This scene is only accessible from level 3 onward.
The Demon - This scene is damn tough!  You must shoot a demon who randomly teleports around the screen.  Since this scene is only accessible on skill level 4 you start low on ammo and have almost no time.  If you shoot the demon enough times you will move onto the final scene.
The Unicycle - This is the final scene in the game.  Here you must shoot the unicycle out from underneath a poor clown and watch him fall to his death (ok so I made the last part up).  Since the unicycle is very thin and moves at a surprisingly fast clip, this scene is nearly impossible to beat.  Like the demon scene, this scene is only accessible on level 4.
So why wasn't shooting arcade released?  No one knows the true reason, but one possibility is the horrid controls.  The light gun aim is so off it makes it almost impossible to hit something by aiming directly at it.  If your lucky enough to actually hit something, it's almost a guarantee that you'll never be able to hit it again as the shooting code is so buggy that shooting at the same spot three times in a row will result in hitting three completely different areas of the screen.  This problem is really the death nail for Shooting Arcade, and ruins what could have otherwise been an awesome game. If you can get over the flawed targeting system, Shooting Arcade can be really fun.  It's interesting to see just how much programmers could squeeze out of the ancient 2600.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Shuttle Orbiter (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Shuttle Orbiter</name>
		<desc>You must get ten parts from an orbiting factory to an incomplete space station. Unfortunately, a comet passed near Earth and left a space debris field that you will need to avoid.

After the launch, you will see the Earth being circled but four colored dots. At the bottom will be the elapsed time, remaining fuel and four indicator bars. These bars are your orbit altitudes and their colors correspond to the colors of the orbiting dots: white for the shuttle, gold for the station, red for the orbiting factory, and green for the fuel depot.

When you are lower in orbit than an item, you move faster. If you are higher than an item, you move slower. You must match orbit and location with something to dock. Once you are close to something, you switch to the maneuvering display. Now you can interact with an item or avoid it, as in the debris. If you hit something, whether debris or man-made orbiting item, you begin to leak fuel. This means you will use fuel even if you are not firing thrusters. You also have a 25% chance to damage the part in the cargo hold.

Game variations
The difficulty switches and select switch are not used. After you press fire on the joystick, move the stick up or down to select the difficulty level, from 0 to 3. Game 0 has no space debris.

There is no score, just the amount of time it takes you and whether or not you got all ten parts in place without running out of fuel.</desc>

		<name>Sinistar</name>
		<desc>An unreleased prototype of the classic arcade title.

The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and must create "Sinibombs" by shooting at drifting planetoids and catching the crystals that are thereby released. Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. At the same time, enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Meanwhile, enemy warrior ships can also directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.</desc>

Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Six Pack (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Unknown 20th Century Fox Game</name>
		<desc>Believe me when I say that this prototype is a complete mystery.  No programmer, no model number, and only a guess on the company  We don't even know the name of the game.  The only we have as to the identity of this prototype is the name Universal, which is silk screened onto the EPROM board.  We now speculate that this might have been a TCF game as another Universal style board was recently found in a TCF prototype.  If this is indeed a TCF game then it might be the mysterious Six Pack that was mentioned in early manuals (based on the racing movie of the same name), however the drag racing aspect fits closer to the TCF movie Heart Like A Wheel (pat yourself on the back if you actually remember that movie).  The only flaw with this theory is that no game was ever announced for that movie.
While we may never know the true identity of this game, it's a sure fire bet that it was meant to be a clone of Activision's Dragster (which is really a clone of Atari's Drag Race).  However unlike Dragster or Drag Race which are viewed from the side, this game is viewed from behind.  The perspective is similar to that of Activision's Enduro, right down to the vanishing point on the horizon.   It's immediately obvious from the graphics that a lot of work was being put into this game.
As previously mentioned, this game is really just a clone of Dragster.  The player must rev his engine and change gears as fast as possible without blowing the engine.  However unlike Dragster the player actually has control over his car and can steer it around the lane.  The faster the player goes, the further the car will move into the horizon and the harder it is to keep from crashing into the sides of the lane.  Careful steering is a must if you're going to win a race in this game.
The controls in this prototype are a bit screwy, and can easily frustrate someone who isn't familiar with them.  Starting the race is particularly annoying, as the player must press left, up, and right until the little man drops the white flag (or the light turns green).  Once the race has started, pressing up will cause the car to accelerate, while pressing down will change gears.  When pressing down the gear indicator will briefly change from N (Neutral) to C indicating that you are changing gears, continuing to press down will cause the car to shift into gears 1 through 4.
As you increase your speed the meter at the bottom of the screen will show your current engine temperature.  If you go too fast in a low gear, your engine will blow.  By shifting gears at the proper time you will enable your car to move faster without blowing the engine.  Once you've reached the finish line, you must press the fire button to launch your parachute and slow your car down.  If you do not launch your parachute in time your car will crash.  Pressing the select button will enable the computer driver which takes over the first players spot (the car will turn yellow).  To race against the computer you will have to use the second players joystick.  There are three different computer components to race against, a yellow car, blue car, and finally a red car.  You will have to race the blue and yellow cars a few times in order to see the red car.
There are two different racing variations available in this prototype, which can be selected by toggling the left difficulty switch. When the switch is in the A position the race takes place on a city street (which looks suspiciously like Sega's Turbo) with stock cars and a man with a white flag that starts the race.  When the switch is in the B position the race takes place out in the desert with dragsters and the race is started by an automatic light.  This is little difference between the two except the dragster variation moves faster than the stock car variation (the player must switch gears faster).  While it may appear that there is no one player option for the dragster variation, there actually is but you really have to work to get to it.  In order to get to the one player dragster race you must first beat all three opponents (yellow, blue, and red), and then you will start the next race in the desert.
While it isn't the best game out there, this racing game show promise and it's mysterious nature simply adds to allure.  This prototype was auctioned off by Best Electronics in 2004, and released by Curt Vendel of the Atari History Museum on Atari Age for the classic gaming community to enjoy.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you have five minutes to get from your front steps to the steps of the school. You have to get through this maze and conquer 30 tubes and ramps AND get to the school.

You start at your front steps. To get on the board, move left or right and while moving, press fire. When you are on your board, just push the direction you want to turn. Press fire to jump and press and hold fire to jump and land in a crouched position. You will also see rails, walls and hurdles but these you must avoid as they will make you crash.

To jump a ramp, just ride towards it and be aligned with it. To clear a tube, ride through it while crouched. If you ride through grass, it will slow you down. To get back up to speed, either crash into something or ride through grass until you stop then get the skateboard going again.

The scoreboard at the top of the screen is not an obstacle. When you get to it, you just keep going.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you have five minutes to get from your front steps to the steps of the school. You have to get through this maze and conquer 30 tubes and ramps AND get to the school.

You start at your front steps. To get on the board, move left or right and while moving, press fire. When you are on your board, just push the direction you want to turn. Press fire to jump and press and hold fire to jump and land in a crouched position. You will also see rails, walls and hurdles but these you must avoid as they will make you crash.

To jump a ramp, just ride towards it and be aligned with it. To clear a tube, ride through it while crouched. If you ride through grass, it will slow you down. To get back up to speed, either crash into something or ride through grass until you stop then get the skateboard going again.

The scoreboard at the top of the screen is not an obstacle. When you get to it, you just keep going.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Ski Run (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Ski Run</name>
		<desc>When you turn on Ski Run you're bombarded by an obnoxious jumble of noise.  Not the best first impression!  Your goal is to ski down a rigidly-defined mountain course lined with orange trees, rocks, and snow men.  Your skier is colorfully rendered and even uses his poles to turn from side-to-side.  I also like how the mountains in the distance slowly rise and fall.  You can adjust your speed as you glide down the vertically-scrolling screen while avoiding trees, rocks, frolicing deer, bobcats, and dancing bears.  Your score is constantly racking up depending on your velocity.  Adding challenge are jumps you need to perform over extended sections of gray muck.  You'll know a jump is about to happen when you reach a large batch of yellow snow.  I have to admit it feels satisfying when you nail a jump.  But much like Ski Hunt (Home Vision, 1983), Ski Run relies too much on luck.  There's virtually no time to react to oncoming obstacles, even when you try to control your speed.  Heck, just trying to stay within the confines of the course is a challenge.  You get 25 (!) lives but you'll be surprised how fast you blow through them.  Audio quality notwithstanding, Ski Run's pleasant visuals and non-stop action might be worth a try if you're looking for some winter-related fun.</desc>

		<desc>In Skiing, your goal is to ski to the bottom of the mountain in the shortest time possible. The mountain is treacherous with plenty of trees and moguls in the way! There are two different modes of gameplay. In slalom mode, there are a series of gates you need to ski through; missing any will result in a penalty to your time. In downhill mode you just need to ski to the bottom as fast as possible. Each mode includes five different skill levels which affect the length of the course (and the number of gates in slalom mode.)</desc>

		<desc>Sky Diver is an action game for two players. The goal is to score the most points by jumping from a plane, opening your parachute,  and guiding your sky diver safely to a landing pad. The longer you wait to open your parachute, the more points you earn for a successful landing, but don't wait too long or your chute won't open at all! For each jump, there will be varying wind conditions which blow your sky diver off course. A wind sock at the bottom of the screen will help you determine the wind speed and direction so you can compensate. There are nine jumps total, and the player with the most points at the end wins.</desc>

		<desc>Fly slalom around pylons (right of the red ones, left of the blue ones). Avoid skipping a pylon, hitting the pylons, trees or hot-air balloons. Try to get the best time you can. If you fly to the wrong side of a pylon, you will get a three second penalty for each missed pylon. The total number of pylons remaining is at the top of the screen above the time. If you hit a tree, pylon or balloon your plane will crash to the ground. You will not die but this will hurt your time as your plane has to take off again. Hitting a pylon will not hurt your pylon count. You will still get credit for the pylon but will lose time as your plane was slowed. You can press the fire button to throttle up or release to throttle down. Move the joystick left or right to turn. You bank into turns so you need to time turns as it is not instant. Up and down on the joystick do nothing.</desc>

		<name>Sky Skipper</name>
		<desc>You pilot a plane and must rescue animals from cages where they were placed by gorillas. To do this, you fly over a gorilla and drop a bomb, knocking the gorilla off its feet. Once this is done, the animals will be out of their cages and you just touch each one to rescue it. The animal cages will only be open for a limited time, then the gorilla will get back on its feet. You must then knock it down again.

You mustn't take too long rescuing the animals or you will run out of fuel. If you run out of fuel, run into a gorilla or the course walls or, strangely, a cloud, you lose a plane. You begin the game with four planes.

Difficulty switches
Set to A for faster plane, set to B for slower plane.

Game variations
Game 1...Tricky flying course
Game 2...Tricky flying course and clouds
Game 3...Tricky flying course, clouds and faster plane.

Scoring
Knock a gorilla of its feet=10 points
Rescue any one animal=100 points
Rescue one of each of the four types of animals, consecutively (1 cat, 1 turtle, 1 rabbit, 1 duck)=500 points

You get an extra plane every 10,000 points.</desc>

Each side-scrolling screen presents various obstacles that the player must precisely jump over (e.g. fences, stalagmites) or land upon (e.g. ledges). Failure to execute any jump results in instant death. Higher difficulty levels introduce flying bats and spiders that the player must also avoid.
The ColecoVision version of Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg. Upon reaching Smurfette's screen, the player can return to the previous screen. Just before the screen changes, it will appear as though the top of Smurfette's dress comes off, making her appear topless.</desc>

		<name>Smurfs Save the Day</name>
		<desc>In this children's learning game, you learn music, sorting and color mixing.

With Harmony Smurf, the computer will play four, five or six notes and you must repeat them. After the notes play, they fall to the ground and you must put them in their correct spots. The highest level has invisible notes, you must match by sound only.

There are two modes, changed by the select switch.
In Game Mode, the computer plays and you must duplicate it. In Toy Mode, there are six notes on the ground and you can make any tune you like, the computer doesn't create a tune.

With Handy Smurf, items will move along a conveyor belt and you must sort them into one of three bins. You press the button to close or open gaps to guide the object but don't press too soon or the gap returns to the way it was before after a short time.

In Game Mode, the first five items are sorted by shape, the next five by size and the next five by color then the sequence repeats only faster. In Toy Mode, after each item is sorted, the sorting criteria (shape, size or color) changes randomly.

With Greedy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf has a colored liquid in a glass. Using blue, red, yellow and white spigots, Greedy must put the same color liquid or mix liquids to get the same color in his glass. If he gets it right, he and Clumsy drink up. If he gets it wrong, the glass drains out.

In Game Mode, the colors start easy and get progressively harder. In Toy Mode, the color selection in Clumsy's glass is random.

There is no time limit or penalty if you get something wrong.</desc>

		<desc>Sneak 'n Peek is a computerized version of the game hide and seek. The game is played by two players (or one player against the computer); one player will close his eyes while the other player hides somewhere. After the second player is hidden, the first player needs to locate him in the shortest time possible. After the second player has been located, the roles will then be reversed. The game takes place in an old house with three rooms available as well as the front yard to hide in; each of these four locations contains five different places to hide. The game can be played with fixed or variable hiding locations; in the fixed game, the hiding locations will always be found in the same place, and the variable game will move the hiding places around each time a room is entered. Two difficulty levels are available; in the tougher setting, the entrance to the hiding places is narrower making it tougher to find.</desc>

		<name>Snoopy and the Red Baron</name>
		<desc>The dastardly Red Baron has stolen important food supplies from the allies during the war.  Hamburgers, ice cream cones, popcorn and other tasty treats have been taken by this evil aviator and sharpshooter. Your task is to help Snoopy shoot down the Red Baron and recover the stolen supplies.

You begin your mission with four doghouses.  It takes eight direct hits to bring down the Red Baron, and for the Red baron to bring down Snoopy's doghouse.  If the Red Baron downs a doghouse, all accumulated treats will be lost.  Press the controller button to fire Snoopy's machine gun.</desc>

		<desc>Oh, no! The Evil Queen has created a poison apple and wants to give it to Snow White! We, the seven dwarfs, have to find Prince Charming so he can save her!

You play as one of the seven dwarfs. First you move through your diamond mine, collecting diamonds. You can collect up to twelve diamonds but you must collect one ruby to leave the mine. In HARD setting, avoid obstacles and falling rocks.

After you grab the ruby, you must cross a river on a log. In the HARD setting, beware of the bat that will try to drop rocks upon you, You can press your button to use a diamond's magic to scare away the bat for a short time.

After the river, you must make your way through the forest without getting grabbed by the evil trees. In the HARD setting, you must also be careful of the bat dropping rocks. You can, again, use diamonds to drive it off. You must hit the flashing white line to exit the forest. After this, you return to the screen with all the dwarfs lined up, dancing, while the Evil Queen is driven away from Snow White.</desc>

		<desc>In Solar Fox, your mission is to guide a space ship though a solar cell matrix and collect as many of the solar cells as you can. When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer; if you collect all solar cells before this timer runs out, you will earn bonus points and skip ahead a level. The game ends when you have lost all of your space ships.</desc>

		<desc>Solar Storm is an arcade style action game where you control a spaceship to defend your home planet. Deadly Deltoid ships will be flying in trying to destroy your planet; in addition to this danger, a far off sun has exploded sending debris towards you. Your job is to shoot everything that is heading your way before it reaches your planet (the bottom of the screen). Each time an enemy ship or some debris makes it past you, your planets shield absorbs the energy and heats up; if it overheats, it will be destroyed and the game ends. If your laser ship crashes into any incoming danger, you lose a life (the game also ends if all lives are lost). Every 500 points there is a bonus screen where you have a chance to earn more lives. The longer you last, the faster the game will become.</desc>

Your goal is to destroy all of the Zylon fighters you encounter, rescue cadets that are trapped on Zylon planets, and to find the planet Solaris to protect it from the Zylons. Your spaceship is equipped with a galactic map which can be used to warp to different sectors of the galaxy. The map shows the location of Zylon squadrons, Zylon planets, federation starbases, wormholes, clusters of stars, and Solaris when you find it. By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.</desc>

For every caught star, a bucket appears to remove some of the water from the cavern.  Mickey also has the opportunity to catch the brooms before they get to the bottom of the stairs and flood the cavern further.

If Mickey fails to provide enough buckets, or stop the brooms, they will flood the cavern, and the game is over.</desc>

		<name>Space Shuttle : A Journey into Space</name>
		<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>

For every 1,000 points scored, you will get another space ship.</desc>

		<name>Space War : Space Combat</name>
		<desc>Space War for the Atari 2600 was among the first home adaptations of the classic mainframe game Spacewar!.

The cartridge includes two different game modes: Space War and Space Shuttle. Space War is the classic one-on-one game of dueling spaceships and requires two players. The goal is to shoot down the opponent with missiles for one point per kill. Each player's ship carries eight missiles and a limited amount of fuel for its thrusters. Once the ammunition has run out, it is refilled automatically, but only if the other player is also out of shots. The controls follow the Spacewar!/Asteroids model of momentum preservation: once accelerated, the ship will keep flying in the same direction until its thrusters fire again. Seven different variants of Space War are available, each toggling different options: the screen boundary is either solid and ships and shots will bounce off, or it can be passed through and the ships and missiles will reappear on the other side of the screen. If hyperspace is available, a player can become temporarily invisible, which uses a lot of fuel and disables the guns, however. If there is a sun in the center of the play field, its gravity will pull the ships towards it and crashing into it will award the opponent one point. Finally, if a starbase is present, ships can fly by it to resupply fuel and ammo.</desc>

		<desc>You are on a moon-based scouting mission in a Mark 16 Starcruiser. Suddenly, enemy alien ships teleport in and start firing neutron missiles, which can destroy you upon impact. You must destroy enemy ships until reinforcements arrive from Earth. The enemy also have laser-directed heat-seeking proton missiles which are fired sparingly. Be aware that as the battle progresses, the aliens will become more desperate and will use the laser-directed heat-seeking proton missiles more often.

You can move in any of the eight directions in the bottom third of the screen. Press the button to fire.

Scoring
Minimum heat seeking missile variations:
Level one alien=125 points
Level two alien=200 points

		<desc>You are an assault ship that was designed to destroy Hyperion military bases.

You must shoot the bases enough so that the energy meter at the bottom goes from the "+" to the "-". Once the meter gets to "-" the base will explode.

Obviously, the base is not a sitting duck. There is a force field that expands and contracts, base defenders and , in higher rounds, shields. The force field has a gap in it that you can shoot through or you can maneuver inside the field and shoot the base up close. Be careful, though, because you can get caught within the field.

If you touch a shield, the force field, the base or are touched by a defender, you lose a life.

The defenders are fireballs, heat seekers, bouncers, wanderers, and homers.

The scoring is as follows:
Destroy a fireball = 25 Points
Destroy a heat seeker = 100 Points
Destroy a bouncer = 50 Points
Destroy a wanderer = 200 Points
Destroy a homer = 400 Points

You also get 25 points for each hit you get on the base.

When you destroy the first four bases, you get 1,000 points per base; the next four, 2,000 points per base and so on.

You get a bonus ship after every second base you destroy and after every 10,000 points.</desc>

You control a bug blaster at the bottom of the screen, and need to defend the three pieces of fruit at the top right of the screen. Various types of attacking spiders scurry around rapidly, trying to destroy your blaster and steal the fruit. If all of your fruit is stolen or you lose all of your bug blasters, the game is over. When all the spiders on a round are destroyed, you move on to the next, faster round. If you still have all three pieces of fruit when a round is completed, you receive an extra bug blaster.</desc>

		<desc>The Green Goblin has set a super bomb at the top of a high voltage tower located on the top of a skyscaper! As Spider-Man, you need to scale the building and defuse the bomb. Use your web to climb the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop you. If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</desc>

		<name>Spike's Peak</name>
		<desc>Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain! Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.</desc>

Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>

To make the game more difficult, the walls are constantly growing, and if you touch a wall you will lose a life! A second game variation is included where one wall is stationary, and the second wall grows. Your goal is to shoot all of the moving multi-colored wall blocks to turn them white. A row of blocks turns white when they all of have been destroyed; the row will then begin growing again, but you will now longer be able to shoot the blocks! When all of the rows have been changed to white, you will move on to the next level. The third (and final) game variation included is similar to the second one, except that the wall behind you will also move inwards; Your goal is still to shoot your way through the left wall before the right wall catches up to you. Each variation has two difficulty levels, the tougher difficulty has twice as many blocks as the easier.</desc>

		<name>Snail Against Squirrel</name>
		<desc>Would you kindly help a little squirrel whom often you found playing in the woods?  I am a very, very friendly squirrel;  I swear, I never intend to hurt that poor snail.  As it becomes colder and colder, I want nothing more than to store some nuts in my caves, lest I should be no more after the winter.  But why in the world is that greedy snail always hiding somewhere to rob me of my nuts, just like those highway men?  See what a dilemma I am involved in?  To keep away from that cunning snail, should I go on carry the nut to my cave or gather a newly ripe one?</desc>

		<desc>Much like Apollo's other famously unfinished game Pompeii, Squoosh is an unplayable demo showing what the game screen would have looked like.  You control a French guy (complete with berete) who can move left and right around the screen, and jump with the fire button.  In the middle of the screen is a giant press with a covered pit underneath it.  When you start the game a grape will come bouncing in from the right side of the screen, and proceed to roll back and forth along the floor.  The concept of this game was to have your guy kick or move grapes into the center of the screen where the press would come down and 'squoosh' them into wine (which would collect in the pit below).</desc>

		<name>Sssnake</name>
		<desc>You were hunting in the Amazon when you become the hunted of prehistoric creatures. You found a fortress with a large gun. Now you must avoid the snakes that enter and exit and shoot the creatures through the holes in the fortress bricks.

The snakes will slither from one side on the screen to the other then come the opposite way one level lower. You cannot kill the snake but you can shorten it when you shoot it. Your gun runs on a gun track inside the fortress walls and always shoots away from the fortress. You cannot shoot through the bricks themselves, only in between them.

Game variations
In game one, the snakes enter the screen from one side but move fast. In game two, they enter from any side but move slower. Either way, you only have one life. Player two begins after player one by just pressing the button on the right joystick. If there is no player two or after player two dies, then you must press reset to play again.

Scoring
You score one point for shooting a prehistoric creature.
You gain no points for shooting at the bricks or shooting the snake.</desc>

		<name>Star Raiders</name>
		<desc>As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all of the Krylon fighters which are closing in on your starbases! There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starships energy; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shield, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the Krylon that are visible on your galactic map have been destroyed, you win this round and can advance in rank (or even be demoted if you performed poorly on a mission).  The games difficulty will gradually increase as you rise in rank from ships cook up to captain.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Star Ship ~ Outer Space (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Star Ship : Outer Space</name>
		<desc>Star Ship contains three different arcade action games which can be played by one or two players.

Star Ship
These game variations are played from a first person point of view in your star ship. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various enemies and space debris. You have a time limit of 2 minutes 16 seconds in the one player versions. In the two player version the time limit is 4 minutes 32 seconds; for half of this time one player will be the star ship commander, and the other will control a space module and needs to dodge the star ships fire. The roles will be reversed for the second half of the time limit.

Warp Drive
These game variations are also played from a first person point of view. Your goal here is to travel as much distance as possible while avoiding the oncoming asteroids.

Lunar Lander
These game variations are played from a third person point of view. You need to pilot your star ship and successfully land on the constantly moving moon. One point is earned for each successful landing, and asteroids and other debris may get in your way and will deduct points if you crash. In the two player versions, one player controls the star ship and the other player controls the moon.

Each of these games feature several variations which control the game speed and level of difficulty.</desc>

		<desc>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</desc>

		<desc>Star Voyager is an action game similar to Star Raiders. You control the space ship Star Voyager from a first person perspective; your objective is to make your way through seven star portals to save the Capital Starport, destroying enemy ships along the way. On each level there will be multiple enemies to destroy; typically they appear first in the distance, then close in slowly while firing torpedoes at you. Using the Star Voyagers weapons (either lasers or photon torpedoes) you need to destroy the enemies before they destroy you. Once a star portal appears, you need to navigate your way through to reach the next level (don't crash into the portal walls, you'll be destroyed!). In addition to the main viewport, the bottom of the screen also contains a status bar which shows the number of enemies destroyed, your energy level, and a scanner to help locate enemies.

Two player game variations are also included; in these one player controls Star Voyager, and the other player can choose to either control Star Voyagers weapons or the enemy ships.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars : Return of the Jedi, Death Star Battle</name>
		<desc>"Death Star Battle" is loosely based on the events of "Star Wars, Part 6: Return of the Jedi". Your task is to destroy the Death Star before its construction is finished. You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following blow up of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star debris.

After successful destruction the game will restart with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster Death Star build up, etc).

Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before starting the game.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars : Return of the Jedi, Ewok Adventure</name>
		<desc>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi: Ewok Adventure, also known as Revenge of the Jedi: Game I, is a cancelled 1983 shoot 'em up video game based on the 1983 Star Wars film Return of the Jedi. The game was developed by Atari Games and was to be published by Parker Brothers on the Atari 2600. Although it was completed, the game was never released for sale, as the marketing department of Parker Brothers considered the controls too difficult to master.
In Ewok Adventure, the player takes the role of an Ewok in the hang glider corps with the mission to destroy a shield generator of the Imperial army. The player can control a hang glider with the joystick and has to evade enemies, which include animations of speeder bikes, AT-AT walkers, Imperial stormtrooper-like figures and Ewoks. Other obstacles along the edges of the game include shrubbery, small boulders and small rivers.
Depending on the game mode, the player can either make the hang glider climb and descend by pulling back and forth the joystick, or he can reverse the vertical directions. Hitting the ground results in a game over, but when flying high, one can fly over enemies. The height of the glider is displayed by the location of the shadow of the ship. Furthermore, the player can pick up rocks to drop on enemies when flying over them.</desc>

		<desc>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back recreates a scene from the movie of the same name. You are on the icy planet of Hoth, and Imperial Walkers are closing in on the rebel power generator. As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!</desc>

		<desc>Save the humanoids from the impending aliens in the sequel to Defender. The task is still rescuing humanoids before Landers can turn them into Mutants, while avoiding and shooting other foes, however you must now carry humanoids to safety through the Stargate of the title. 

Entering this Stargate not only warps you to the nearest humanoid in jeopardy, but can also warp you ahead (while on the first 15 levels) if you enter it with 4 or more humanoids, and give you extra lives if you warp with 10 humanoids, so there is a trade-off between guaranteeing the safety of existing humanoids, and trying to advance your position

There are more enemies on screen than ever before. The Inviso button makes you invisible to enemies, but also to yourself, so you will have to follow your bullets to work out where on the screen you are.</desc>

		<desc>This is a hurdles horse race.

The horse's names, from bottom to top, are: Lucky Devil, Absent Mind, Just Missed and Little Dictator. You play as one of the jockeys and must reach the right side of the screen first. The horse runs and hurdles come at you from the right. To jump these hurdles, you turn the paddle to set the height of the jump, as indicated by the marker on the right. You press the button to jump. The better you jump, the faster your horse goes. After 3 minutes, if no one has gotten all the way to the right, the race ends and whoever was in the lead wins.

There are 6 game variations. In games 1, 2 and 3, the distance between the hurdles is uniform with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.
In games 4, 5 and 6, the the distance between the hurdles is random with the computer-controlled horse's racing ability being poor, good and excellent, respectively.
The difficulty switches are not used.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Stellar Track (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Stellar Track</name>
		<desc>This is an Atari 2600 version of a Star Trek game found on many college mainframes.

Like those mainframe programs, it has no graphics, only text. You use the joystick, moving left or right, to select the command you want then press the red button. You then move the joystick left or right to select set the parameters of that command, if there are any. You start by pressing Reset or Select to choose how many enemies you must kill in how many stardates. 

The commands and any settings are as follows:

Galaxy Map=a 6x6 grid that starts out empty until you do a long range scan. Afterwards, the quadrants will show a 2 digit number. The left digit is the number of aliens in the area. The right digit will either be a 1 or a zero, depending on whether there is or is not a starbase in that area. Galaxy map costs you no energy or stardates.

LR Scan=Long range scan. This will tell you what is in your quadrant and all the quadrants next to yours. If there are any enemies in your quadrant when you do an LR scan, they will attack you. LR scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

SR Scan=Short range scan. This shows you the stars, aliens and starbases in your quadrant. You need to do this to destroy aliens and dock with starbases. Like LR Scan, if there are aliens in your quadrant, they will attack after you use SR Scan. Also, like LR Scan, SR Scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.

Warp=Warp is how you move, either from quadrant to quadrant or from sector to sector within a quadrant. You move by setting 2 settings. The first is your direction. You select a direction based on the numbers below:
8  1  2
  | /
7--*--3
 / | 
6  5  4
Next, you select how many quadrants and sectors to move. If you want to move within a quadrant, set the left number to zero so you don't warp out of that quadrant. Warp uses stardates, energy and a turn. If you warp into a quadrant that has only you and stars, the screen will be green. If you warp into a quadrant with aliens or aliens and a starbase, the screen will be red. If you warp into a quadrant with just the starbase, the screen will be gray. You cannot warp through stars. If you try, you lose the stardate and energy but don't go anywhere.

Photon Torpedo=If you hit an enemy with one of these, just one shot kills them. You select the direction with the same numbers as warp. there must be a clear line of sight between you and the enemy; no stars. You carry up to 9 torpedoes and they can be replenished.  Photon torpedoes do not cost energy or time, just a turn.

Phasers=Unlike photon torpedoes, you do not need to be directly in line of the enemy or tell the game where to fire. You just set how strong you want the blast to be, via a three digit number, and the computer fires. The closer you are to the enemy, the harder you hit. Phasers use the amount of energy from you as you fired. You also use a turn.

Status=A status report. This will tell you how many stardates, aliens, energy units and photon torpedoes are left and whether you have taken damage and to what. If you have taken damage, you will see a negative number next to the damaged item. This is how many stardates it will take to repair the item on your own. You cannot leave the quadrant if your engines are damaged. Instead, you must try to warp the number of quadrants that would take that much time. You won't go anywhere but you will repair.

If you dock at a starbase, you are instantly repaired of all damage, refueled and torpedoes are restocked. Starbases are placed randomly in the galaxy and never move or get destroyed. There are always two per galaxy. To dock, warp to the quadrant and sector where the base is, so you over the top of it.

Skill (Difficulty) switches
The right switch controls how easily you take damage. In the Expert (A) position, your chance of taking damage is twice as likely as in the Novice (B) position.
The left switch controls phaser strength. In the Novice (B) position, your phasers are twice as strong as the aliens'. In the Expert (A) position, your phasers are the same strength as the aliens'.</desc>

If a complete character is correctly formed, the character will perform a dance and you will hear their musical theme; if an incomplete character is formed, the musical theme heard will be partially from each of the characters you did create. Several levels of difficulty are included which dictate the time limit and which character needs to be created. In the easier levels, the character you must create will be indicated by text at the bottom of the screen. In the more difficult levels, you must create a character based on the theme song that plays.</desc>

		<name>Stronghold</name>
		<desc>You are sent to check out an abandoned asteroid base called Stronghold. As you approach, drones are launched from the surface. It may be abandoned but apparently the automatic defense system still works.

You must shoot or avoid the drones. If the drones are cloned, and traveling in sets, shooting any drone in the set destroys all the ones in the set, if they are destroyable (see Game variations). You can move in any direction but cannot shoot straight left or right. You can shoot in any other direction, however. After you get past the drones, three shields form near the bottom of the screen. Also, interceptor and patrol ships appear. The interceptors track you and the patrol ships just move back and forth over the shields.

You must shoot through the shields while dodging these ships so you can shoot the command crawler on the asteroid's surface. Be warned, though, that once there is a hole in the shield, the command crawler will shoot through it to destroy you. The crawler tries to stay below you but it is slow. In some game variations, the Mega-Field starts to form at the top of the screen, reducing your maneuvering room(see Game variations).

Difficulty switches
The difficulty switches determine what level you will start on.
Both are set to B=start at level 1
Left is set to A and right is set to B=start at level 9
Left is set to B and right is set to A=start at level 17

		<path>./No-Intro/Stunt Cycle (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Stunt Cycle</name>
		<desc>Stunt Cycle was one of Atari's first "Non-Pong" standalone consoles, and was based off the Atari coin-op of the same name.  The console consisted of a set of handlebar grips, which you could use to make your cycle move faster or slower and a fire button used to make you jump.  The gameplay revolves around making your "Stunt Cycle" jump over cars (ala Evil Knievel) and land safely on the other side without flying off the end of the screen.  Your cycle starts at the top of the screen, where you are given two "rows" of screen space to build up speed before hitting the ramp at the bottom.  The "trick" to the game is to build up enough speed to jump over the cars, but not too much that you go crashing off the edge of the screen.  If you successfully make the jump the row of cars gets wider and you have to go back and jump it again.
It is interesting to note that the arcade version has your cycle move through 'tubes' on the sides of the screen between rows whereas the home console version does not.  This means that in the arcade your cycle moves left to right across the first row, then RIGHT to LEFT across the second row before moving left to right again on the bottom.  This is a bit more realistic (well as realistic as motorcycle blasting through invisible tubes on the sides of the screen can be anyway) but can mess with your head if you're not expecting it.  The home console and 2600 port simply has the player 'warp' back to the left side of the screen when he reaches the end, meaning you always travel left to right on each row.
Sometime in 1980 Atari decided that Stunt Cycle would make a great 2600 game, so Bob Polaro was tapped to do the conversion.  Using the paddle controllers to simulate the original consoles bike grips, Bob made a near perfect port of the standalone console.  One change that was made to the game was the addition of color.  Since the original coin-op and home console were from 1976, the graphics were in Black and White which was standard at the time.  However Atari 2600 games had to have the option of color or B&amp;W, some color was added to the game (although not much) to spruce it up.  After a few months of programming, Stunt Cycle was finished and ready to go.
It was around this time that marketing had "brilliant" idea; why not make Stunt Cycle into a Dukes of Hazzard game?  So Bob went back to work retooling the graphics to fit the new Dukes of Hazzard theme.  The cycle was changed into the General Lee, while the row of cars was changed into a lake.  The colors were brightened up a little and some Dukes of Hazzard theme music was also added to the game to complete the illusion. So after a few more months of tinkering, the new Dukes of Hazzard version of Stunt Cycle was good to go.  However by this point (late 1980/early 1981) the game was starting to look a bit dated so management decided that a completely new version would be better.  So programmer Mark Hahn of the Atari NY field office was tapped to do a new Dukes of Hazzard game from scratch which was also never released.
So after a few more months of tinkering, the new Dukes of Hazzard version of Stunt Cycle was good to go, but there was a problem.  Cleaver playtesters soon realized that you could change the speed on the car in mid-air!  This means you could go full blast at the ramp and then slow down suddenly after you've made the jump, but before you've landed.  This basically took the challenge out of the whole game, making it fairly boring.  After Dukes of Hazzard was shelved, programmer Mark Hahn was then tapped to do a totally new Dukes of Hazzard game from scratch (which was never released either).
Stunt Cycle/Dukes of Hazzard has a few interesting options to keep the game fresh.  The first three variations allow the player to not worry about skidding out and change their speed mid-air during jumps, this is basically the 'easy' version of the game.  The second three variations are the 'pro' mode where players must watch their speed on turns (the invisible tubes on the edges of the screen) or they will skid out and crash, you also cannot change your speed during jumps in these variations.  The final three variations are a combination of the two modes in which you can still skid out, but you can also change your speed in mid-air.  The difficulty switches also control how large the landing zone will be.
Did Atari make the right decision in canceling Stunt Cycle?  This is a hard question to answer since it's unknown what Atari's original motives were.  Had Stunt Cycle been released in 1980 as a color port of the coin-op it probably would have been very successful since people who bought it would have known what they were getting, and wouldn't mind the blocky graphics, which were standard for that time.  Had Atari released it as Dukes of Hazzard a year later, people would have probably felt gypped as it wouldn't be long before they realized that the game was nothing more than Stunt Cycle with new graphics.  Atari made the right decision in not releasing the updated Dukes of Hazzard version, but screwed up by not releasing the original Stunt Cycle version.  Chalk this one up to another act of Atari mismanagement.
Strangely Stunt Cycle was never mentioned in any Atari catalogs, and was never assigned a product number.</desc>

		<desc>Players take on the role of a stuntman who has to escape various dangers and make it to a flying helicopter.

Stuntman is broken down into three timed stages. The first stage has the stuntman climbing ropes in order to get to a helicopter while also dodging flying birds. The second stage has the stuntman climbing ropes again but now arms him with a sword and requires him to defeat the flying devilfaces before he can make his escape. The third stage has the stuntman climbing ropes again dodging enemies, but he must also grab a hold of all of the balloons on the stage before he make his getaway. The stages then repeat in this order two more times with the later stages increasing the challenge by adding more enemies. After completing the nine stages, the game repeats at the next highest speed level. There are six speed levels in total and the desired speed level may be chosen from the beginning also.</desc>

With 8 difficulty settings there is a lot of the game to master as you must start to keep an eye on your fuel, torpedoes, radar, and enemy while avoiding depth charges as the difficulty rises.  You can fire up to two torpedoes at a time. While enemy shows go by your periscope sink as many as you can.  The periscope can turn 360 degrees and look off into the horizon or close to your sub.  Some ships move slower than others, and one of the ships moves so fast that the only way to hit it is by tracking it by radar instead of visually.</desc>

		<desc>Subterranea is a side scrolling shooter. Your goal is to locate treasure crystals within the Hexuplex Caves. Controlling your cave ranger, you need to blast the various types of aerobots which are guarding the cave. When all of the bots on a cave level have been destroyed, a passageway opens allowing you to travel deeper into the caverns. When you reach the last level of the cavern, you can collect the treasure crystal and be transported to the next (more challenging) set of caves and try for another crystal. In addition to the deadly aerobots, be sure not to crash into cave walls; these will drain your energy rapidly, especially if you hit one of the skulls. When all of your reserve cave rangers have crashed, the game is over. As you progress through the caves, they become narrower and the enemies move faster. Standard and advanced skill levels are available.</desc>

		<name>Super Cobra</name>
		<desc>Super Cobra is a side scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

		<name>Super Football</name>
		<desc>The is an American football game with an isometric view. Player one always starts as offense and are in the red jerseys. The computer (or player two) starts as defense and are in blue jerseys.You have the choice to pass or run. On the offense, you control the quarterback until he passes the ball. You then control the receiver. The quarterback cannot pass after he crosses the line of scrimmage. On defense, you control the corner.

Game variations
Game 1 (Novice)=3 minutes per quarter
Game 2 (Standard)=7 minutes per quarter
Game 3 (Advanced)=10 minutes per quarter
Game 4 (Expert)=15 minutes per quarter

Play selection
Offense selects both the formation and pattern that the receiver will run*. The formation is the number on the left, from 1 to 9. The pattern is the number on the right, from 1 to 4.

Defense only selects formations, from 1 to 9*. If the offense selects to punt or a field goal, the defense play is automatically selected to counter that.

To see the formations and patterns, you must refer to the game manual, as they are not named or graphically displayed on screen.

*=In game 1 (Novice), you do not manually select plays, they are selected automatically.

Scoring
Field goals=3 points
Touchdowns=6 points
Extra point=1 point

Inaccuracies
There are only 5 players per side.
You cannot tackle anyone within the five-yard line and the goal, therefore...
There are no 2-point safeties or 2-point conversions
There are no penalties</desc>

		<desc>Welcome to the exciting and competitive world of SURROUND. Your basic objective is to surround your opponent, causing him to run out of space in which to move, and at the same time not running into anything yourself. You can set up a blockade, force him into a corner or wander off by yourself and hope that he runs into something on his own.

Along with the basic SURROUND game, we've added four game features to make things more interesting. Be sure to read Section 4 to learn more about these features.

Then there's VIDEO GRAFFITI. It's just for fun without the competitive edge thrown in. VIDEO GRAFFITI actually allows you to draw on the screen.

Surround was one of the nine Atari 2600 launch titles released in September 1977.</desc>

		<name>Survival Island</name>
		<desc>You are headed to a mysterious island to study a temple when your ship is sunk. Now you must get to the island while collecting supplies , get through the dangerous jungle then explore the temple. All in a days work.

This game is in three sections. They are called Shipwrecked, The Wilderness Island and The Secret Temple.

Shipwrecked: You begin on a raft in the water. You must make your way to the island at the top while avoiding sharks and other sea creatures. Along the way, you must collect food and water so you can survive the island. If a shark or other sea creature hits you, you will lose the raft and all supplies. If you are hit when not on a raft, you will lose your life. You can press fire to swim faster but this will cost you life points, which can get you killed.

The Wilderness Island: You make your way on the island while avoiding snakes, traps and other dangers. You must look for the temple, the key to the temple door and any other items you will need to get through the temple. Watch your food meter that it doesn't run out. Use the menu to eat food/drink water as needed. You can also switch to search mode, which allows you to place your walking stick on an item to learn what it is without getting hurt.

The Secret Temple: You make your way through the temple in first person perspective, trying to learn its secret. Sometimes you will need to find certain items to pass through magical barriers. Watch out for one-way walls and invisible transporters.</desc>

Given the fact that the Supercharger allowed for more memory and larger games, Sweat! probably would have been an amazing game had it been completed.  Of course this never happened as the video game market was crumbling rapidly and people weren't spending money on regular video games, much less games that required special hardware.  It was around this time that the financially troubled Starpath merged with Epyx.  Most of Starpath's programmers transferred over to Epyx and used Sweat!'s game concept to create Summer Games.</desc>

		<name>Sword of Saros</name>
		<desc>You have entered a wizard's dungeons in search of the fabled Sword of Saros. You must avoid the wizard, his hunter bat and other nasties while gathering treasure. Then you must escape from the dungeons.

You begin in the maze. The narrow areas are corridors and the wider areas are rooms. You must move from room to room, avoiding the wizard and his bat, gathering treasure, items and keys. Once in a room, do not stand around as each room has a monster in it that will harm you. Some rooms have doors that have either gold or a part of the sword behind them. When you find the sword piece, it will transport you to the next level of the dungeon.

In the first two levels, you will be able to see the entire maze. On the next two levels, you will reveal parts of the mazes as you explore them. On all later levels, you will only see directly around you. If a monster touches you, you will lose life points. If you encounter the wizard, you will lose life points and will need to get through his skeletons. You will start at the bottom of the screen and need to make your way to the top. In the final dungeon, all the rooms have only unlocked doors but you will need gold to bribe the monsters so you can search the doors for the exit.

The items in the maze, and their uses, are:

1. Gold: Not a selectable item. Needed to bribe monsters in the last level
2. Gems: If you collect nine gems, you can use them to get one or more type of each other item
3. Lamp: Makes it possible to see the entire maze. Not needed for mazes one or two.
4. Potion: Restores four to seven life points. You can never have more than twenty-five total life points.
5. Cross:  Makes the wizard and bat move as far from you as the can
6. Scroll: Allows you to see the wizard and bat, even if they are not in a visible portion of the maze. Not needed for mazes one and two.
7. Ring: Makes you invisible to the wizard, bat and room monsters
8. Keys: Not a selectable item. Needed to open locked doors except on last dungeon. Keys do not leave the dungeon level where they are found. When you get the sword piece, any extra keys you are carrying are lost and you must find new keys.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/SwordQuest - EarthWorld (USA).a26</path>
		<name>SwordQuest : EarthWorld</name>
		<desc>SwordQuest: EarthWorld was an adventure game produced for the Atari 2600. The game play boils down to walking from room to room, finding and dropping items, beating the action stages in order to find more items, and seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items in the right rooms. 

The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.</desc>

You control a squadron of five ships at the bottom of the screen, your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the various enemies which will be attacking. If one of the ships in your squadron is hit by enemy fire, it will be destroyed. The game ends when all five ships have been destroyed. As you progress through the game, you will occasionally have the chance to replenish missing ships. Everytime you complete a round by shooting ten enemies, an extra ship will float by on the screen. You can add this ship to your squadron by catching it in an empty space in the formation. Every time you complete four rounds, the game will advance to the next level with increased difficulty!</desc>

		<name>Tanks But no Tanks</name>
		<desc>In Phantom-Panzer, the player takes control of an assault vehicle in order to defend their "energy base" at the bottom of the screen from the attacking phantom tanks.

The game consists of three phases: the first phase takes place in a city and looks like a maze. It offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles to stop them.

The player can only shoot one bullet at a time and has to destroy 20 tanks in each stage. Enemy bullets can be canceled by hitting them with one's own bullet. The player loses one life if they collide with one of the tanks or the enemy bullets. The game is over immediately, however, if an enemy tank or shell hits the player's energy base.</desc>

		<name>Tapeworm</name>
		<desc>You are Slinky the tapeworm. You must move about the bean patch, eating beans. Each time you eat a bean, you grow longer and the bean count goes down by one.

Beans appear randomly in the patch and you must eat them before the beetle at the bottom get from left to right to get the count down to zero. If the beetle gets to the right before you get the bean, two more beans will appear in the patch and two more beans are added to the count.

At times, Beeky the bird or Spanky the spider will pass through the bean patch. In later levels, an obstacle will appear in the middle of the patch.

You lose a life if you touch your head (yellow square) to the obstacle or the sides of the patch, touch your head to your body, or Spanky or Beeky touch your head (eat you).

The third patch is night. When you get a bean, you can see the patch for two seconds. If you need more looks, you can press the fire button for another two seconds of light but it costs you a bean.

The levels and their point values are:
Apple (5 points per bean, 50 points for the apple)
Orange (10 points per bean, 100 points for the orange)
Grape (15 points per bean, 150 points for the grapes)
Strawberry (20 points per bean, 200 points for the strawberry)
Banana (25 points per bean, 250 points for the banana)

You get a bonus worm every 1,000 points. You can have up to 4 worms in reserve.</desc>

		<desc>Tapper is an action game where you're a beer tapper (barman) and have to serve beer to demanding customers. There are four customers, each has its own lane lengthier than the previous one, whom you have to keep at bay. If they reach the end of the lane without receiving their beer, you're a goner; if you miss one and accidentally spill beer needlessly you lose a life and should one of them throw you back the mug and you fail to catch it, you lose a life as well.

Occasionally a bizarre icon will appear on one of the lines and, should you grab it, will invoke a "cabarette"-style show which will keep some of the customers occupied.

The Xbox 360 version includes bonus rounds, as well as co-op and versus multiplayer modes, also online, along with achievements.</desc>

		<name>Tax Avoiders</name>
		<desc>You are John Q and you want to be rich.

In this game, you start out on the income screen where you try to collect the money (dollar signs) while avoiding the governmental red tape (look like red snakes). You have only one year to get your money and invest it. Each second, a day goes by. My, how time flies.

Once a season, you are sent to the investment/tax shelter screen, where you must collect an icon representing an investment and then grab your portfolio (briefcase). Investments have a 50/50 chance of making or losing money. Also on this screen is a character whose color changes.

What color he is determines who he is:
Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these audits, you always lose. You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back to the income screen.There are no appeals to tax court.
Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you $1,000.00 but whatever tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a better one.
Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put you in the best tax sheltered investment available, thus making you the most profit.

After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter. The object is to have $1,000,000.00 at the end of the year after taxes.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Telepathy (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Telepathy</name>
		<desc>Telepathy is one of two known prototype games that were developed for Atari's failed Mindlink controller.  The Mindlink was a headband that player wore on his head and plugged into the joystick port.  The idea was that the Mindlink's sensors would pick up any facial movements or muscle twitches the player would make.  Atari actually said that the Mindlink read the player's thoughts (sure it did...).  The problem was that the Mindlink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did work players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face all day.  After disappointing test results, the Mindlink controller was wisely canceled.
Telepathy was actually developed as a demo to show what kind games the Mindlink could do.  This "demo" is made up of seven different action screens held together by a loose "mine" theme.  Thankfully Telepathy is playable without the Mindlink controller (unlike Bionic Breakthrough) by pressing the joystick button.  It's unknown if Atari was thinking of releasing Telepathy sans Mindlink or if the joystick code was put in the game for playtesting purposes.
Unlike most games of the time, Telepathy has a demo mode which will run through all the screens if the game is left untouched.  Interestingly you can control the player in the demo using the joystick, it's unknown if this was intentional or just a bug.  The game starts off with a really cool sign which descends from the top of the screen telling you which mine your on.  After that you're whisked off to the first screen.
-The Plain-
This is the oddest screen in the whole game, because it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the rest of the screens.  You control a large white man with antennas sticking out of his head.  You must guide the man over the glowing triangles as he walks along the plain.  The glowing triangles appear in a weaving line (like a trail of bread crumbs) and will eventually lead to a large hole in the ground.  Each glowing triangle is initially worth 5 points, but each successive triangle you collect is worth an addition 5 points (5, 10, 15, 20, etc.).  If you miss a triangle the point value starts back over at 5.  The controls on this level are a bit strange, as the man will always want to move to the far left side of the screen.  You must struggle to keep him moving on the proper path, collecting triangles as he goes.  As you get to the higher mines the amount of triangles and the speed at which you walk increase.  The pattern of the triangles will also become more twisted and harder to follow.  Once you reach the hole at the end of the path you are taken to the spider screen.
-Spiders-
This is the first level in the mine itself.  Your guy is now a small Indiana Jones looking character instead of the large man with the antennas.  Your character looks so much like Indiana Jones in fact that some people initially speculated that this prototype was really Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (this was before the names on the EPROM's were known).  The goal of this level is to run past the spiders and get to the hole at the bottom of the screen before the timer runs out.  If you get hit by one of the spiders, you start over at the top of the screen and lose a life.  The spiders are fast and hard to avoid because they bounce around the screen, but you can always find a safe zone at the edges of each ledge.  You can either run (your normal mode of transportation) or walk by holding down the fire button.  Walking allows you to move more accurately, but since it's speed that counts you'll want to run to the exit.  You have 15 seconds to complete this level, but since the timer counts in tenths of a second it starts at 1500.  From here on every time you complete a level you'll get 100 points for each second left on timer.  In the higher mines the spiders are faster and move more erratically.
-Elevators-
This level starts to appear beginning in mine 2.  The board structure is very similar to the spider level, but instead of avoiding spiders you need to avoid moving elevator platforms.  If your man happens to bump into a moving platform he'll be thrown back a bit, but if he steps onto one he'll be transported back to the top of the elevator.  Since time is short anything that keeps you from getting to the screen is bad, even if it's not deadly.  For some reason the holes in the ledges have been replaced by white hatches, but they function the same way.  In later mines the speed of the elevators increases dramatically.
-Ledges-
This level begins to appear starting in mine 3.  You must carefully maneuver you man as he falls from ledge to ledge, avoiding the fireballs being shot from the sides of the mine.  The fireballs move with blinding speed, and with your slow rate of decent there is almost time to avoid them.  You can tell where the fireballs are about come from by looking for the red glow around the rocks on the sides of the screen.  The best strategy for this level is to land on each ledge and wait for the next fireball to launch before continuing.  In later mines the ledges begin to move making things even more difficult.
-The Mashers-
This level starts to appear from mine 4 onward.  At first glance the level appears to be empty, but suddenly large mashers will quickly descend and retract from the ceiling.  Timing is crucial on this level as the mashers are very fast and are invisible until they descend from the ceiling.  As always, your goal is to reach the bottom of the screen before the timer runs out.
-The Miner-
This level is rather simple.  After your man falls down the shaft you can either walk over to the left and save the stranded miner (ala HERO), or exit to the right and forget the miner.  Grabbing the miner doesn't seem to do anything, but since this is the goal of the game it would be dumb not to.  If you choose to rescue the miner you can levitate out of the hole by pushing against the wall.  There are large boulders which fall down from the top of the shaft, but they're slow so they don't pose much of a threat (although the speed does increase with each mine).
-The River-
This is always the last level in each mine.  On this level you must move your man through the gaps in the river walls while avoiding the deadly piranha.  The controls are similar to the Plain level as you man will constantly move to the left unless you keep pushing the joystick to the right.  Your man will automatically move through the gaps in the river when he is in front of them, but since the level is constantly scrolling forward this is a good thing.  If you get bumped off the bottom of the screen or touch a piranha your man will be killed and you'll have to start the level over.  The higher the mine level, the faster the fish and scrolling become.  If you complete this level you will be transported to the next mine.
It's unknown if Atari actually ever planned to turn Telepathy into a commercial game, but as it stands it's one hell of a demo.  It's hard to believe that these mini-games would work well with the hard to use Mindlink controller, as they require pin point precision, constant movement, and other things that the Mindlink didn't do well.  They do however work quite well with the joystick, which may be why that code was added.  So fire up the emulator and enjoy Telepathy, the best game that never was.</desc>

		<name>Tempest</name>
		<desc>On the list of games that probably should never have been tried on the 2600, Tempest has to be near the top.  Why Atari decided they could reproduce a 3D vector game on the 2600 is beyond me, but the results weren't pretty.  Sometimes one has to respect the limitations of the 2600.
I've said it once and I'll say it again; If there's one thing the 2600 doesn't do well it's diagonals.  Unfortunately Tempest is chockfull of diagonals as the tubes angle out from the center of the screen to form complex geometric patterns.  This leads us to the next problem, if there's a second thing the 2600 doesn't do well it's complex geometric patterns!  The 2600 version gets around this by not having 3D tubes, but rather a flat looking shape (often jokingly compared to a pair of woman's underware) with the enemies coming from one side and the player moving on the other.  For some reason the board seems to flux and change a bit as things move around the screen, this is probably the result of a programming glitch.  The board  s segmented into what could be called tubes (if you use your imagination), but these "tubes" don't seem to correspond to where the real tubes (which are invisible) are.
This brings us to the next problem, if there's a third thing the 2600 doesn't do well and it's 3D perspective.  Atari couldn't get around this one; the 3D perspective is what makes Tempest "Tempest".  Atari tried to simulate this by changing the enemy's size to make it look like it was getting closer.  Unfortunately there aren't nearly enough frames of animation to do this, so the enemies sort of jump forward in an awkward fashion.  The enemy graphics are very blocky and becomes even more evident as the size is increased when they approach the outer edge of the tube.  This combined with a very blocky looking "shape" for the board makes for one ugly looking game.
Amazingly, even with the 2600's limitations, there are four different types of enemies present in this version.
Flippers -- These are the little bowtie shaped guys who are the main enemy of the game.  They're not dangerous until they reach the top of the tube and start coming after you.
Flipper Tankers -- These will break into two Flippers when hit.
Pulsars -- These guys are dangerous!  They will electrocute the tube they're in every now and then killing you instantly if you're on it.  In this version the tube doesn't light up when electrocuted, but the Pulsar itself will glow a second before, warning you to beware.
Fuseballs -- These fun little guys are similar to Flippers but they only zip up and down the tube they're in.
The controls in this early version are often very frustrating.  There appear to be set places where your blaster can move to (hidden tubes), but they don't seem to correspond to the shape on the screen.  This wouldn't be so bad if they were at regular intervals, but they seem to be very close together towards the middle of the screen and very far apart near the edges (a side effect of mirroring the playfield).  This makes lining up your shots with the incoming enemies very difficult because you're not quite sure where the next "hidden tube" is.  This coupled with the fact that the "jumping" enemies move very quickly up the short tubes makes for a very difficult game.  The firing is a bit off as well, and it appears that your blaster will fire towards the left side of it's graphic instead of from the middle.  This wouldn't be so bad if the bullets didn't have a bad habit of disappearing when too many object are on the screen (probably due to flicker), this can lead to some mysterious deaths from invisible bullets.  Thankfully you have your Super Zapper in this version, which can be activated by pressing up and fire.
In the programmers defense, they did a wonderful job on Tempest considering she was attempting to do the impossible. But while a game technically can be done on the 2600, doesn't necessarily mean it should be (see Double Dragon for another example).  Also, since this version isn't complete, it's really not fair to start judging it yet.  Given some time, I'm sure a much more playable version with improved graphics and smother gameplay could have been put together.  While it probably wouldn't have ever looked like its arcade counterpart, this prototype proves that Tempest could (in a very limited fashion) be done on the 2600.  A later version with some added features like a title screen was reviewed in Ultimate Gamer magazine, but it's unknown what happened to that prototype.
The name of the programmer for the 2600 version of Tempest has been a bit of a mystery.  Carla Meninsky has generally been identified as the programmer, but some other programmers seem to recall that someone else worked on Tempest.  Carla herself shed some light on this when she mentioned that the prototype we have isn't her version at all.  More digging shows that the current prototype (dated 1-5-84) was made long after Carla had left Atari. So it appears that Atari decided to assign another programmer to make a new version of Tempest after Carla left rather than use her existing code.  Unfortunately, Carla's original version remains lost and the identity of the programmer behind this version remains a mystery.</desc>

There are two types of tanks. The white Sentry tanks only move through existing tunnels and will only fire on you if there is clear space between you and them. The blue Digger tanks will create their own tunnels to pursue you. There is also a Sentry tank at the bottom of the screen that slowly moves towards your reserve tanks.

There are enemy supplies buried in random areas that if you get them will get you bonus points. Later levels have the bases only appear one at a time or have no dirt between you and the enemy tanks, leaving them to pursue you from the start.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Thwocker (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Thwocker</name>
		<desc>Thwocker is a game as strange as its name.  Written by Charlie Heath (of Reactor fame), Thwocker was described as "Joust with musical instruments".  While this isn't a bad description, it really doesn't illustrate all the gameplay elements that make Thwocker such an interesting game.  You control a little conductor (who happens to look like a bowling ball) who must bounce around a maze collecting musical notes for his song.  Along the way you must avoid various musical instruments that are out to get you (can't we all just get along?).  However you can't go grabbing just any musical notes, you must collect them in the proper order.  The current note type needed is shown at the bottom of the screen.  If you touch the wrong type of note you will ricochet off it, send your conductor flying across the screen (usually into a waiting enemy).  After collecting all the notes you must grab the treble clef symbol at the top of the maze to start the song.  Once the song starts to play your character will be able to touch enemies and notes for points (think of it as a power pellet) until the song ends.  After completing the song you can exit the level by touching the exit square.
The controls in Thwocker take a little getting use to, but they're not as tricky as they first seem.  The levels seem to be made out of some kind of springy material, so your character bounces all around the screen.  You can control how high you bounce by pushing up and down.  Pushing down will make the conductor take little bounces, while pressing up (as you touch the ground) will make him bounce really high.  You can stop bouncing all together by pressing the fire button, which will make the conductor sort of "skip" across the level.  You will need to master all these bouncing techniques to successfully complete the level.
Sadly Thwocker is incomplete as there is no way to exit the level.  It was thought that they player simply needed to touch the exit square after completing the song to finish the level, but this does not appear to be the case.  It appears that the code that allows you to destroy the enemy after completing the song also allows you to destroy the exit, so the game appears to be unwinnable.  However after careful examination of the game code, it appears there may be more to Thwocker than meets the eye.  Apparently the player must somehow "combine" the two voices of the song after it starts playing to exit the level.  Unfortunately we haven't figured out how this portion of the game works yet, but it may have something to do with picking up certain objects on the screen.  However just because the code to exit the level exists doesn't mean it's actually possible to do it in the game, so Thwocker may still be unwinnable after all.
Thankfully you can still see the other levels by selecting the higher difficulty levels at the title screen.  Programmer Charlie Heath (who owns the only other known prototype) has said that Thwocker is only around 80% complete when development was cancelled.  One has to wonder what else Charlie had in store for us, as other than the lack of the ability to finish a level Thwocker seems fully playable and complete.  Perhaps there were some minor game or difficulty issues left to work out?  The only glitch I've seen in the game is on the game select screen.  The game number should go from 1 to 10, but there are six games in between 9 and 10.  These game numbers are represented by a space, another space, a white eigth note, a space, a white quarter note, and a dot.  This is most likely because the game numbers are stored in hex (base 16), so there are 16 games represented.  It is unknown if Charlie actually intended for there to be 16 games or only 10, but since they all seem to be playable one comes to the conclusion that they were indeed planned.
Thwocker, along with Kabobber, were victims of the collapsing videogame market in 1984.  It was around this time that Activision decided it was time to get out of the 2600 market and concentrate on the new gaming fad Home Computers.  Activision did release a few new games during the 2600 revival years, but Thwocker was not one of them.  At this point Activision was concentrating on converting arcade games to the 2600 instead of releasing older unpublished games.  What they didn't realize is that the older games they were ignoring were much better than the new games they were putting out (but that's another story).  Thankfully Thwocker finally got its long overdue release, and now we can all enjoy what has to be one of the most unique 2600 games I've ever seen.</desc>

		<name>Time Pilot</name>
		<desc>Time Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>This game has you placed in a spacecraft of some kind (the cover art makes it look like a futuristic passenger jetliner with weapons attached) flying through what looks like a cave, while taking on several enemies that attack you from the right side of the screen. After surviving a few rounds, you'll go into an 'underground' cave where you fly through a treacherous corridor and attempt to dock with a refueling station. After that, it's back to blasting targets again. Lather, rinse, repeat.</desc>

Mad Dog growls and grabbing from behind drags Skin Head across the ring whipping him around in an airplane spin; letting go so he flies into the ropes and bounces back to meet Mad  Dog's concrete forearm across his neck... a perfectly executed clothesline. 

Wasting no time Mad Dog elbow drops him. Skin Head's face winces in pain as he fights his way up and staggers to his corner to tag his partner in. 

Big Chief takes the tag, grabs Mad Dog lifting him over his head and body slams him into the mat. Mad Dog's stunned, he's not getting up.

Deadly rats and other dangers must be avoided as you run and jump around the caves. Meanwhile, Senta must defend herself from giant bats and other creatures while trapped in the cage; although she can't move, she is capable of firing magic at enemies to destroy them. You are able to switch screens between the two characters to select which character to control.

		<name>Tomcat : The F-14 Fighter Simulator</name>
		<desc>To be born with wings...

Become a F-14 Naval Aviator undergoing seek and destroy missions while dodging and gunning enemy bogeys in deadly dogfights with your 20mm cannon and air-to-air missiles.

You cockpit comes with state of the art technology, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force: Display and main computer, Bogey Alert Indicator, G-Force Indicator, Electronic Counter Measures, and a Cannon Overheat Indicator (yes, it can overheat!)...and if your feeling up to it, give the ol'bird a boost to Mach 1.0!

The gameplay like other simulation games consists of taking off, flying, combat and landing. Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision.

Taking off and landing however, also required additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try no to run over him...yet).

Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).

After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.</desc>

		<name>Tooth Protectors</name>
		<desc>In this game, you are T. P., the Tooth Protector, and are trying to protect some teeth from tooth decay by the Snack Attacks. 

Snack Attack moves across the top of the screen dropping snack food crumbs towards the teeth. You move at the bottom of the screen, just above the teeth. You must deflect the crumbs back up, hopefully hitting Snack Attack or a falling crumb for points. 

Each round is time-limited. You play until the time runs out then you get bonus points depending on weather you lost any teeth and how many. 

Occasionally, Snack Attack will try to swoop down and grab you. If you are caught, you lose a man. 

If one or more of your teeth are in danger of being lost, indicated by it flashing, you can press your fire button to Reach toothbrush, Johnson &amp; Johnson dental  floss and Act fluoride dental rinse to save that/those tooth/teeth. You get three of these cleanings to start but earn bonus cleanings every 50,000 points. 

The game is over after you lose all three of your men or lose three of your teeth.</desc>

		<desc>A downtown skyscraper has caught fire, numerous people are trapped, and you need to come to the rescue! Your goal is to rescue as many survivors as possible from the many floors of the building. On each floor, your fire fighter begins at the bottom of the screen and needs to reach the top where the survivors have taken cover. Blocking your path are numerous (and dangerous) fires. Your fire fighter is equipped with a hose and an unlimited water supply to help you put out the fires. You need to be quick, however, for if you take too long the survivors will die! When you rescue as many survivors as you can and make it back out of the room, the floor is complete and a helicopter will transport you to the next floor. Although it isn't necessary to put out all of the fires on a floor, you will earn bonus points if you do. The higher you get in the building, the tougher the game becomes. Gameplay is for one or two players, and several game variations and difficulty levels are available.</desc>

		<desc>Track &amp; Field is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. It is based on an arcade game of the same name. Events include 100 meter dash, hammer throw, the long jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The NES version adds skeet shooting, triple jump, javelin throw, high jump, and archery as events but loses the hammer throw event. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If you want to go to the next event or round then you will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

		<name>Tunnel Runner</name>
		<desc>Tunnel Runner is an advanced 3D Maze Game, essentially what a 1st person version of Pac-Man game would be like.  Because "Tunnel Runner" was designed with a built-in expanded memory chip (RAM Plus!), it's 12KB of memory gives it the ability to present the maze in three dimensions.  Therefore, the playfield is a colorful, three-dimensional maze, so you never see yourself... just the walls on either side of you that form the corridors you travel along.  As you move along the passage-ways, additional tunnels appear on either side, which you can turn into by pressing left and right.

Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each maze.  Through the assistance of a MAP, you can maneuver within the maze.  While attempting to locate the key to exit the level, you must also avoid the hungry Zot's.  You will discover these enemy creatures throughout the maze.  Successfully recovering the key without being intercepted by the Zot's opens the portal to the next level.  As you pass each level, you will discover that the complexity and difficulty increases, while your MAP gradually reveals less and less information… ultimately, your map will be of little use, requiring you to survive solely by instincts and quick thinking!</desc>

As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.

The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds.  The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.
 
When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens.  There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</desc>

The object is to drive around a twisty course and collect all the colored flags. You can jump over gaps and over or onto other cars. If you land on another car, you kill them and collect points. You can also collect things like balloons and ice cream cones for bonus points. The faster you collect all the flags, the bigger a time bonus you get.

In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you will need to jump on him. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. In two player games, play alternates.</desc>

		<name>Vanguard</name>
		<desc>Vanguard is an arcade style shooter for one or two players. Your goal is to pilot your spaceship to the City of Mystery which is located at the end of a heavily guarded tunnel, and once there destroy the creature Gond. The tunnel is broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, rainbow zone, stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features different types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either horizontally or vertically. In the mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly through this, your ship temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped with lasers to help destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions, however your speed is decreased when firing. You also need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge; your fuel will deplete at a rapid rate, and your ship will crash if it runs out. Fuel is gained each time you destroy an enemy, so make sure you destroy as many as you can! When you finally make it through all the various zones of the tunnel and defeat Gond, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Venetian Blinds Demo (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Venetian Blinds</name>
		<desc>As the name implies the Venetian Blinds demo isn't a game, but a demo that simulates a pair of Venetian blinds! The joystick can be used to raise and lower the blinds by pushing up or down. When the blinds are raised a nicely done sunset is visible out the window. 

The story behind the Venetian Blind demo is rather interesting. As most people know, Activision was founded by several ex-Atari employees who had left due to Atari's policies on programmer recognition (or the lack thereof). One of these employees was Bob Whitehead, creator of the "Venetian Blinds" technique, which was first used in Atari's Video Chess to display eight objects in a row instead of the normal six. Even though Activision had never used the Venetian Blinds technique in any of their games, that didn't stop Atari from threatening to sue Activision for "stealing" the technique along with other various proprietary information. 

Since Activision knew that they hadn't stolen anything from Atari, they decided to play a little joke on Atari. According to David Crane, when the Atari's lawyers questioned them about the "stolen" Venetian Blinds technique David showed them this demo and said "Is this what you guys are referring to?". Apparently Atari wasnâ€™t in a laughing mood, and they went through with the lawsuit. In the end Atari ended up losing the case and Activision went on to become the most successful of the 2600 third party companies. 

Although Activision never made a game out of this demo it didn't go completely to waste. The sunset was later used in the background of Barnstorming.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Video Chess (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Video Chess</name>
		<desc>This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.

To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.

Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square.  To carry out the en passant, you must advance your
pawn to the fifth rank.  Your opponent then has the option of moving
his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two
squares.  If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.

Skill levels
These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.
Level 1=15 seconds
Level 2=30 seconds
Level 3=45 seconds
Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds
Level 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds
Level 6=12 minutes
Level 7=10 hours
Level 8=10 seconds

Level 8 is a beginner level.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Video Olympics ~ Pong Sports (USA).a26</path>
		<name>Video Olympics : Pong Sports</name>
		<desc>Video Olympics is an action game containing numerous variations of the game Pong. Two players (or one player against the computer) control paddles on the screen and attempt to prevent a bouncing ball from getting past them. In the most basic game variations, each player has a single paddle and there are no obstacles on the screen. The other game variations add paddles and obstacles, and some are loosely inspired by various sports and change the playfield around, but the goal remains the same: hit the ball past your opponents paddle into the goal to earn points. A few of these variations are:

1. Foozpong: Each player controls multiple paddles which are arranged somewhat like a foozball table.

2. Soccer pong: Each player controls two paddles (representing one goalie and one player) and the goal is much narrower.

3. Hockey pong: The playfield is set up to resemble hockey; the goal isn't at the very edge of the screen, so the ball may bounce behind and around the goal.

4. Quadrapong: The goals are located along the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the screen. This game is played by four players, two per team with one person defending each of the four goals.

5. Handball pong: There is no goal, and two players take turns hitting the ball against a solid wall to earn points. One point is earned each time your opponent is unable to return the ball.

6. Volleyball pong: The screen is set up like a volleyball court with a "net" in the middle. Both players are along the bottom of the screen and need to bounce the ball past their opponent.

7. Basketball pong: Each player controls a paddle on the bottom of the screen, and attempts to hit the ball into their opponents basket at the top.</desc>

		<desc>This is an exercise game.

You must step on the dot the same color as square the bug is on. If you wait too long or step on the wrong dot, you lose one of your eight lives. In later levels, you will have a bug and a butterfly. You must step on the bug but not the butterfly. Other levels have two bugs and a butterfly and may allow you to step on any bug or may require you to step on them in a certain order.

Game variations
Use the red dot to select your level.
One to Three=Random bugs with butterfly
Four=Sequential bugs in increasing order
Five=Sequential bugs in decreasing order
Six=Sequential bugs in increasing order
Seven to Nine=Combination bugs in increasing order.

Scoring
You get 1 points for each correct bug squashed
After 20 points, the level increases.</desc>

Aliens will come from any of the four sides of the screen and you must shoot them before they ram your wall. If ten aliens or one super alien hit your wall, the outermost wall and the bridges connecting it to the next wall in will collapse. You can only shoot in the direction on the wall side you are on.

The game ends when:
1. You are on a wall section or connecting bridge when it collapses, causing you to float away.
2. Your score reaches 999,999 points.

The aliens pictured at the bottom of the screen indicate what level you are on. If you go an entire level without one alien hitting your wall, you regain a wall layer to a max of four.</desc>

The only thing you have left is your tachyon launcher that moves back and forth and fires a tachyon beam. Hold off the space pirates for as long as you can.

Using your paddle controllers, move the tachyon launcher left or right and press the button to fire a tachyon beam. The beam only travels up. Destroy the pirates and avoid them colliding with you. Sometimes the pirates travel on groups. Destroy any pirate in a group to kill the whole group.  You only have one life. Once you die, player two can begin by pressing the button on their paddles or you can press the Reset switch to start a new game.

Game variations
The only variation is one or two player. The difficulty switches are not used.

Scoring
You score one point for each enemy killed. After sixteen points, the enemy start shooting photon shots at you to kill you from more of a distance.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Wings (USA) (Proto).a26</path>
		<name>Wings</name>
		<desc>As you might have guessed with a name like Wings, this game is all about planes.  Wings an air combat simulation game similar to the Atari Lynx title War Birds.  Wings was originally intended to be a 4K game, but it was decided that trying to cram a complete flight simulator into a tiny 4K cartridge was too difficult.  Therefore Wings was shelved until the development of the RAM Plus chip (a 10.5K RAM chip) made it possible.  Wings was thought to exist as a prototype for many years, but wasn't discovered until late 2004.  It was originally assumed that Wings would use the Booster Grip controller for its complex controls, but when the prototype was finally found it was discovered that it supported not only the Booster Grip, but also a strange two joystick scheme instead (similar to the late Atari release Radar Lock).
The Left Joystick
The Left Joystick is used to control your plane.  Pressing the fire button and pushing up will throttle up the engines, while pressing the fire button and pushing down will throttle down the engines.
The Right Joystick
The Right Joystick is used to access your weapons.  Your weapon systems are only enabled after clearing the runway or reaching an altitude of 60 Feet.  Pushing down will switch between machine guns and missiles, while pressing up will fire your weapons.  Guns are weak, but have unlimited ammunition.  Missiles on the other hand are very powerful, but you only get two.  Use them wisely.
Before diving into the gameplay, this would be a good time to discuss the the instrument panel as it is vital to your survival.  Your instrument panel contains four different gauges: Fuel, Power, Airspeed, and Altitude.  Each of these gauges uses a digital readout to display to keep your informed on how your plane is performing.  
    Fuel Gauge (FUEL) - Measures how much fuel you have remaining (duh!).  If your fuel drops below 1500 it will begin to beep and flash warning you that you are about run out of fuel and crash.
    Power Gauge (PWR) - Measures the current power of your engines.  More power means more speed, but it also eats up more fuel.
    Airspeed Gauge (ASPD) - Measures your current airspeed.  You must maintain an average airspeed of at least 1535 MPH or this gauge will begin to flash and beep.  If you exceed 8000 MPH your plane will fall apart.
    Altitude Gauge (ALT) - Measures your current altitude.  You must maintain an altitude of at least 512 Feet or this gauge will begin to flash and beep.
Also appearing on your instrument panel are three displays:
    Radar (left) - Shows you where the enemy planes are.
    Artificial Horizon (middle) - This gauge shows you how level your plane is.
    Compass (right) - Shows the direction your plane is heading in.
After a rousing rendition of Flight of Valkyries (which can be toggled on/off with the left difficulty switch), you start the game on the runway (naturally).  To take off you must throttle up your engines and achieve an airspeed of at least 512 MPH.  Once you've reached 512 MPH you can begin to lift the nose up (push down) and go airborne.  The runway will change colors (from Blue -&gt; Gray -&gt; Red -&gt; Green/White) to help you tell how far away from the end you are.  Once you're in the air, things get a little more tricky.  You will need to maintain an average airspeed of at least 1535 MPH to remain airborne or your gauge will begin to flash and beep.  If your speed drops below 780 MPH you will begin to go into a nose-dive and eventually crash.  You will also need to keep an altitude of at least 512 Feet or the altitude gauge will begin to flash and beep warning you that you're too low to the ground.
Keep in mind that the direction of your nose will change how the plane reacts.  If your nose is pointed upwards you will gain altitude, but will also lose speed.  Likewise if your nose is pointed downwards you will gain speed, but lose altitude.  Figuring out the proper positioning of your plane's nose is key to staying airborne.  If your plane is level you can keep the a constant speed and altitude by throttling the engines to around 500.  This will help keep everything under control while you're busy shooting down planes.
Once you're flying a bit you will undoubtedly notice that you are not alone.  Enemy planes and ground guns will begin to take pot shots at you shortly after take off.  At first you may only see their bullets flying at you (represented by a spinning square), but if you get close enough you'll actually see the enemy themselves.  Thankfully your plane is armed with the latest in air to air combat weaponry.  To shoot your guns at the enemy planes, get one in your crosshairs and press up on the second controller.  You can also shoot missiles at the planes (press down on the second controller to switch to missiles), but you only get two so use them wisely.  Missiles are much more powerful than your machine guns, but should only be used in emergencies.  You can tell when you have your missiles armed by the targeting box that replaces your normal crosshairs.
Wings isn't a bad game, but grows repetitive after while for those of us who don't absolutely love air combat games.  There just aren't enough enemies to keep the game interesting, as you can fly around for long periods of time without ever getting a blip on your radar.  Another issue is there there are no clouds in the sky nor objects on the ground to give you a sense of speed.  Apparently marketing wanted to add some clouds, but they never got implemented.  Wings is more complex than other 2600 air combat games like Air Raiders, but not so complex that it becomes a chore to keep your plane flying.  It appears that Stuart was able to strike the perfect balance between accurate flight sim and action oriented dog fighting.  Sadly CBS decided to pull the plug on Wings mere weeks before it was ready to be released when they closed down cartridge development on October 23rd 1983.  The decision was made so late that promotional material (hats and scarves) and even a commercial had been made.
There are two different Wings prototypes known to exist.  The earlier version dated June 3rd is in NTSC format, but is missing the enemy planes making it pretty boring to play.  The later version dated October 10th has the enemy implemented, but is in PAL format (CBS may have been planing on making Wings a PAL only release towards the end).  Oddly enough Stuart doesn't remember working on a PAL version of Wings.</desc>

		<name>Wizard</name>
		<desc>If there was ever an obscure prototype it's Wizard.  Wizard was supposedly the last of Atari's last 2K games, but went unreleased in favor of the new 4K games.  Since Wizard was never advertised in any Atari catalogs and it was never assigned a part number, most people don't even know of its existence.
Wizard can best be described as a cross between Berzerk and Wizard of Wor.  You control a wizard (at least I think he's a wizard), who must attempt to destroy the swirling star shaped creature.  The board layout is a giant maze, which makes it hard to run from the creature and to get a clean shot off.  Unfortunately the creature can move through the maze walls, but thankfully it can't shoot through them.  Once you take a shot you'll notice that your wizard dims a bit, this means you are recharging, and cannot shoot.  Once your wizard is done recharging he will light back up again, and you can take another shot.  You don't have to worry about aiming you shots, as you will automatically shoot in the direction of the creature.  This makes it easy to run away but still take shots at the creature.
Your wizard starts out with zero damage (indicated by the right number), and will die if the damage counter reaches 99.  Each shot you take from the creature causes you two points of damage, touching the creature will also cause you two points of damage.  As you take more and more damage your wizard will weaken until he finally dies.  In your weakened state you will move slower and take longer to recharge.
The creatures damage counter is on the left side of the screen.  Each time you shoot the creature it will take two points so damage and be stunned for a few seconds.  This is your chance to get away to a safe distance and hide as you recharge.  The creature is normally invisible unless it's shooting at you or it has taken a hit.  You can tell where the creature is by listening to the "heartbeat" in the background.  The closer the creature, the louder the sound.
If you manage to get the creature's damage counter up to 99, it will turn black and die.  Your victory is short lived however as a new and more deadly creature will replace the old one.  Each new creature starts with less damage than the previous one, and moves and shoots much faster.  Each time you kill the creature your kill counter (next to the creatures damage counter) will go up by one, and your damage counter will go down significantly.
Wizard has a unique two player feature where one player can control the wizard while the other player controls the creature.  Since the creature is normally invisible, the second player must move blindly about the maze until he comes in range of the wizard.  The second player's creature will automatically fire at the player making his job slighty easier.  This interesting twist on the normal two player variation shows some innovation not seen in many games.
Hidden in a random part of the maze is a small glowing flame.  If the left difficulty switch is set to A then you Wizard has the added task of defending the flame.  If the creature touches the flame your wizard will slow down as his source of power has been captured.  On the easy setting the flame is invulnerable to the creature and doesn't have any affect on the game.
While Wizard may not look like much today, it's amazingly fun in short bursts.  Unfortunately by the time Wizard was ready to be released (1980), Atari was starting to make 4K games with better sounds and graphics than their 2K predecessors.  According to programmer Chris Crawford "It didn't fit well into the product line".  Wizard was simply too dated to be released as is, but probably could have been made into a decent 4K game had Atari wanted to take the time to retool it.  But as they say, time waits for no man.  Sadly Wizard was left in dust, destined only to become a footnote in prototype history.</desc>

		<name>Wizard of Wor</name>
		<desc>Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a top-down point of view.

The player controls a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures which wander about the maze like corridors. The creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at the player, and some even have the ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.

When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys the creature before it escapes, the next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points.

The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

You command a tank at the bottom of the screen. You can move left or right but you are always moving forward. You can control the forward speed by pushing up or down on the joystick.

As worms move back and forth you must shoot them so they don't touch your tank. Also shoot any blocks in you path. Try not to shoot fuel pagodas. Touch them to refuel. You can go to the far left or right of the screen and not get touched by a worm but you can't shoot them when you are there either.

In the two player games, you have selections on co-operative or competitive. In co-op, you have the same points and fuel tank. When one tank refuels, it refuels both. In competitive, you each have a score and fuel tank. You compete to get enemies and fuel.</desc>

		<desc>Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart.  A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Xevious (USA) (Proto) (1983-08-02).a26</path>
		<name>Xevious</name>
		<desc>It's dangerous, it's devious, it's Xevious.  Never before has a tag line so perfectly summed up a video game.  Xevious was one of the first (if not the first) in a new genre of arcade games: the scrolling shooter.  While we make take such games for granted today, back in 1982 such a concept was unheard of.  Most games of the time had only one non-scrolling screen, which seriously limited their creativity.  One screen shooter like Galaga and Galaxian were ok, but players hungered for something different.  Xevious satisfied that hunger.
It's a nightmare, but it's true.  Scientific research has determined that we are the actual aliens on Earth and the evil Xevions are the original inhabitants.  Now the Xevions want Earth back, minus the humans! Earth's last hope is an experimental fighter plane known as the Solvalou.  The mission is dangerous, success isn't guaranteed, and odds are this is a one-way trip.  But at this point it's do or die!
As Earth's last hope, you must successfully defeat the Xevion assault fleet before they reclaim earth.  However this won't be an easy task, the Xevions have had over a millennia to develop the biggest, nastiest, and most destructive ships Earth has ever seen.  Thankfully the Solvalou is armed with the latest in weapons technology which will cut through the Xevion hordes like a hot knife through butter.  The Solvalou has two main weapons, a laser blaster for taking out air targets, and a photon bomber for destroying ground targets.  Over the course of the game you'll run into numerous enemy types which can only be destroyed using the appropriate weapon, so mastering the dual shot (air and ground) technique is vital.
Toroid Fleet Ships -- These round rotating objects are the first and most common enemy encountered in Xevious.  Gliding in from the left or right, a small squad of Toroids come towards your ship before darting away from whence they came.  Thankfully Toroids don't pose much of a threat unless you happen to be distracted by something else at the time.
Torkan Scout Ships -- Torkan Scouts are similar to Toroids except if they see your ship they will change color and fire.  They also have a bad tendency to ram your ship.
Jarra Spinners -- Jarra Spinners tend to move faster than Torkan Scout Ships, but they also move in a more straight forward pattern.   As the name implies they appear to be spinning as they move.
Mirrors (Bacura Shields) -- Mirrors are the single most annoying enemy in Xevious.  These large rotating squares appear in large swarms at various points in the game.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but they are INDESTRUCTABLE!  That's right, all you can do is avoid them and hope one doesn't go smashing into your cockpit.  Thankfully Mirror swarms are fairly uncommon.
Zoshi Death Squad -- These odd shaped UFO's are encountered in the later areas.  As the name suggests, Zoshi Death Squads are quick and deadly.  Take great care when attempting to engage themnnGiddo Spario -- These tiny balls of energy are quick and hard to see.  Unless you're careful these will wipe your ship out in no time.
Zakato Energy Launcher -- Zakato Energy Launchers (also known as Black Balls) are on of the deadliest enemies in Xevious.  Appearing out of nowhere, Black Balls self-destruct into a fast moving bullet which will then launch itself at you.  While one or two are easy to avoid, Black Balls like to swarm and appear right next to your ship making them all the more deadly.  Black Balls tend to herald the arrival of Andor Genesis, so when they start to appear you know Andor isn't far behind.
Andor Genesis -- This is the big one, the Mother Ship!  Andor Genesis is a hulking air fortress armed with four laser cannons just dying to blow you out of the sky.  The only way to defeat Andor Genesis is with a direct hit on the rector core with a photon bomb (think Star Wars), however getting close enough to Andor Genesis without being hit is a major challenge.  Destroying the rector will cause Andor Genesis will cause it to flee and prepare itself for another attack.
Domogram Rovers -- As the name implies Rovers spend their days roaming along the ground just taking pot shots at your ship.  Rovers move quite fast and can be difficult to bombnnLogram Sphere Station -- These sphere shaped structures appear to be harmless although they will occasionally shoot a bullet towards your ship.  Be on your guard.
Derota Defense Station -- These square pyramid shaped structures are the most common defensive structure that you'll encounter.  Derota Defense Stations will often shoot a quick moving energy bullet at your ship.  Take them out quickly before they become a problem.
Batra Energy Station -- These square pyramid shaped structures provide power for the Xevion assault fleet.  They'll take pot shots at you if you get too close.
When Ray Kassar was fired as CEO of Atari in 1983, James Morgan was hired to take his place.  Jim put all projects on hold for 30 days while he reviewed what had been going on during Ray's "reign of terror".  Since the 7800 was deemed high priority, most 2600 and 5200 projects were put on hold or outsourced to GCC.  It was originally assumed that Xevious was one of the 2600 titles that were killed off during this time, but recently a nearly complete version of the game was found proving that it survived at least until early 1984.
While the gameplay in the 2600 version is amazingly accurate, some corners still had to be cut.  One of the 2600's biggest problem was that it only had one fire button, making many arcade conversions difficult.  Tod got around this problem by having the fire button serve double duty as your fire and bomb button.  Pressing the fire will shoot a shot and drop a bomb that slowly arcs to where the targeting sight is.  The enemy AI also got a bit of a lobotomy so they all generally act the same instead of having distinct attack patterns.  Amazingly Tod was able to implement a scrolling background as was seen in the arcade version.  While this background wasn't as detailed as it's arcade cousin, it was still a major accomplishment for the 2600.  Not only was Tod able to get the scrolling background implemented, but he was able to have multiple enemies appear on the screen at once with little or no flicker.  In fact the only thing that flickers in the entire game is your ship which is actually made up of two missile graphics to keep more sprites free (hence the funny shape and flickering).  This odd design also makes your ship almost twice as large as it was in the arcade (making it harder to dodge enemy shots).
Although Xevious appears to be just about complete, there are a few bugs still present in the code.  The 2600 version of Xevious has an option for controlling the scrolling speed with the difficulty switches (a feature not found in any other version).  However when the game is put in fast mode (A=Slow, B=Fast) the scrolling gets rather choppy and non-uniform making it hard to play after a while.   There's also a glitch in one of the animation frames of the boss (Andor Genesis) due to the game accidentally reading sound code rather than graphics code.  Scoring seems to be a bit generous in this version making it easy to rack up extra lives, but it is unknown if this would have been changed before release.  The code is also unoptimized which wastes a lot of space that could have been used for other improvements, however since code optimization is one of the last things that is done to a game before completion this is not unexpected.
Unfortunately as good as Xevious was, it didn't stand a chance against the deadliest of enemies ?collapsing market'.   The 2600 version along with the 5200 version were canceled with the 7800 version being the only one to see the light of day.  This is a shame because it's obvious that Tod was a highly skilled programmer who could push the 2600 to its limits and Xevious is an amazing looking game.  The remaining bugs could have probably been squashed with just a few more weeks of work with code optimization taking a little longer.  Had it been finished Xevious probably would have been a mainstay in the 2600 library and a big hit, but it appears that Atari wasn't willing to wait.</desc>

Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but they are INDESTRUCTABLE!  That's right, all you can do is avoid them and hope one doesn't go smashing into your cockpit.  Thankfully Mirror swarms are fairly uncommon.
Zoshi Death Squad -- These odd shaped UFO's are encountered in the later areas.  As the name suggests, Zoshi Death Squads are quick and deadly.  Take great care when attempting to engage themnnGiddo Spario -- These tiny balls of energy are quick and hard to see.  Unless you're careful these will wipe your ship out in no time.
Zakato Energy Launcher -- Zakato Energy Launchers (also known as Black Balls) are on of the deadliest enemies in Xevious.  Appearing out of nowhere, Black Balls self-destruct into a fast moving bullet which will then launch itself at you.  While one or two are easy to avoid, Black Balls like to swarm and appear right next to your ship making them all the more deadly.  Black Balls tend to herald the arrival of Andor Genesis, so when they start to appear you know Andor isn't far behind.
Andor Genesis -- This is the big one, the Mother Ship!  Andor Genesis is a hulking air fortress armed with four laser cannons just dying to blow you out of the sky.  The only way to defeat Andor Genesis is with a direct hit on the rector core with a photon bomb (think Star Wars), however getting close enough to Andor Genesis without being hit is a major challenge.  Destroying the rector will cause Andor Genesis will cause it to flee and prepare itself for another attack.
Domogram Rovers -- As the name implies Rovers spend their days roaming along the ground just taking pot shots at your ship.  Rovers move quite fast and can be difficult to bombnnLogram Sphere Station -- These sphere shaped structures appear to be harmless although they will occasionally shoot a bullet towards your ship.  Be on your guard.
Derota Defense Station -- These square pyramid shaped structures are the most common defensive structure that you'll encounter.  Derota Defense Stations will often shoot a quick moving energy bullet at your ship.  Take them out quickly before they become a problem.
Batra Energy Station -- These square pyramid shaped structures provide power for the Xevion assault fleet.  They'll take pot shots at you if you get too close.
When Ray Kassar was fired as CEO of Atari in 1983, James Morgan was hired to take his place.  Jim put all projects on hold for 30 days while he reviewed what had been going on during Ray's "reign of terror".  Since the 7800 was deemed high priority, most 2600 and 5200 projects were put on hold or outsourced to GCC.  It was originally assumed that Xevious was one of the 2600 titles that were killed off during this time, but recently a nearly complete version of the game was found proving that it survived at least until early 1984.
While the gameplay in the 2600 version is amazingly accurate, some corners still had to be cut.  One of the 2600's biggest problem was that it only had one fire button, making many arcade conversions difficult.  Tod got around this problem by having the fire button serve double duty as your fire and bomb button.  Pressing the fire will shoot a shot and drop a bomb that slowly arcs to where the targeting sight is.  The enemy AI also got a bit of a lobotomy so they all generally act the same instead of having distinct attack patterns.  Amazingly Tod was able to implement a scrolling background as was seen in the arcade version.  While this background wasn't as detailed as it's arcade cousin, it was still a major accomplishment for the 2600.  Not only was Tod able to get the scrolling background implemented, but he was able to have multiple enemies appear on the screen at once with little or no flicker.  In fact the only thing that flickers in the entire game is your ship which is actually made up of two missile graphics to keep more sprites free (hence the funny shape and flickering).  This odd design also makes your ship almost twice as large as it was in the arcade (making it harder to dodge enemy shots).
Although Xevious appears to be just about complete, there are a few bugs still present in the code.  The 2600 version of Xevious has an option for controlling the scrolling speed with the difficulty switches (a feature not found in any other version).  However when the game is put in fast mode (A=Slow, B=Fast) the scrolling gets rather choppy and non-uniform making it hard to play after a while.   There's also a glitch in one of the animation frames of the boss (Andor Genesis) due to the game accidentally reading sound code rather than graphics code.  Scoring seems to be a bit generous in this version making it easy to rack up extra lives, but it is unknown if this would have been changed before release.  The code is also unoptimized which wastes a lot of space that could have been used for other improvements, however since code optimization is one of the last things that is done to a game before completion this is not unexpected.
Unfortunately as good as Xevious was, it didn't stand a chance against the deadliest of enemies ?collapsing market'.   The 2600 version along with the 5200 version were canceled with the 7800 version being the only one to see the light of day.  This is a shame because it's obvious that Tod was a highly skilled programmer who could push the 2600 to its limits and Xevious is an amazing looking game.  The remaining bugs could have probably been squashed with just a few more weeks of work with code optimization taking a little longer.  Had it been finished Xevious probably would have been a mainstay in the 2600 library and a big hit, but it appears that Atari wasn't willing to wait.</desc>

		<name>Yars' Revenge</name>
		<desc>In Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</desc>

		<desc>You are a flying saucer trying to destroy cities below. You can move any direction and to fire, just hold the button and push that way. The cities will fire missiles at you to stop you. In later levels, the missiles turn into balloon bombs that you mustn't run into and later levels, the balloon bombs turn into horizontally travelling missiles if you are level with the balloon.

There are four game variations. Games one and two are one or two player, respectively, at a beginner level. Games three and four are one or two player, respectively, at advanced level.

You advance to the next level when all the cities of that level are destroyed. The game ends if you reach 999,999 points or lose all of your ships.</desc>

		<desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

When plugged into an Atari 2600, the cartridge displays a rendition of the same image, courtesy of Interleaved ChronoColour(tm) technology. These carts were individually numbered and there were only two ways of getting one: By placing an order of $50 or more in the AtariAge Store, or by participating in the 2003 AtariAge Holiday GreetingCart Contest and winning one for free!</desc>

Use the buttons of the controller to move your ship left or right and beam letters to the correct slots on Ernie's ship. Once all the letters are in place, Ernie can fly away.

This game helps kids learn to recognize letters and match capital letters to lower case and recognize easy-to-confuse letters.

The game manual also contained a read-aloud story.

		<desc>Ever wanted to try your hand at computer programming but had no idea where to start? BASIC Programming for the Atari 2600 makes programming, well, basic.

BASIC is an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. In conjunction with the manual, this cartridge will help you learn the beginning steps of this easy-to-learn computer language. You can create simple programs, games, and even compose your own music. Up to nine lines of code are allowed.

To simplify the input of data, BASIC Programming requires a set of special keyboard controllers that plug into both the left and right joystick ports. These keyboard controllers were included in the original packaging.</desc>

		<desc>Big Bird wants to win the county fair egg contest and you can help him.

A chicken at the top will lay and egg and it will go down a chute. You must get Big Bird under the correct chute to catch the egg.

Game one is one player only. Games two through ten are one or two player. All games have two rounds.

Game one is a practice round. There are two chickens, straight chutes and when you move Big Bird left or right, he pops right under the chute.

Games two and three have three then four chutes and the game gets faster in the second round. Game two's chutes are straight, game three's zig-zag. Big Bird still pops under a chute.

Games four, five and six have three rounds. There will be eleven white eggs dropped and one golden egg. Games four starts with two zig-zagging chutes in the first round and four in the second. Game five has two crisscrossing chutes in the first round, four in the second. Game six has four crisscrossing chutes in both rounds. Big Bird  no longer pops under the chute but must be positioned correctly.

Games seven has eleven white eggs and one golden egg dropping per round with unlimited rounds. There are five broken eggs on the bottom left and you do rounds until you miss so many eggs you are out of broken eggs. when you catch the golden egg, in addition to points, you get an extra broken egg.

Game eight is the same as game seven except you can't see an egg in the chute, only when it pops out the bottom.

Games nine and ten are the same as game seven but the chutes shrink up in the direction of the hens. This means you must memorize when the chute comes out for which chicken. In game nine, the chutes are all the same for each round. In game ten, the patterns change per round.

Each white egg caught is worth one point, each golden egg, five.

For ages three to seven.</desc>

		<desc>In Brain Games one or two players attempt to earn as many points as possible by solving various puzzles presented by the computer. There are six different puzzles included, which are:

Touch Me: The computer will play a sequence of tones. Each button on the controller represents a different tone, and by pressing the correct button you need to recreate the same sequence.

Count Me: The computer will display a sequence of numbers. Using the controller, you need to press the numbered buttons in the same order the computer displayed them.

Picture Me: The computer will display a series of symbols. It will then scramble the order they are displayed in, and you need to reorder the symbols back into their original configuration.

Find Me: The computer will display a series of objects on the screen, and you need to select the object which is dissimilar from the others. Your score is based on how fast you can successfully do this.

Add Me: The computer will display a list of numbers. You need to enter in the sum of the numbers before the timer runs out.

Play Me: This game allows you to play your own songs in free form mode; each button on the controller represents a musical note. Both controllers can be used for a duet, and several example songs are included in the instruction manual.</desc>

Points are scored based on how many turns it takes to correctly identify the code. A second game variation called Nim is also included. In this game, two players take turns removing items from a stack. On each turn, a player must take at least one item from a stack, and the player who removes the last item from the screen wins.

		<desc>Cookie Monster hungry! Want cookie!

You are moving around a maze, collecting cookies and bringing them back to a cookie jar.

Games one through three are one player, games four through ten are one or two player.

In games one, two and three, you move Cookie Monster around the maze, get the cookies and return them to the cookie jar, one at a time. Between mazes, Cookie Monster eats each cookie, one at a time. There are three mazes per game. In game one, there are one, two then three cookies. In game two, four, five then six and in game three, seven, eight the nine.

Games four through six are timed. You can carry multiple cookies and keep playing mazes until time runs out. In games four, five and six, you have five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Games seven through nine are also timed but now you play as the Cookie Kid. You are trying to collect cookies for a surprise party for Cookie Monster. Since he hasn't been told this, he is pacing back and forth on the other side on the fence. Each time you pick up a cookie, Cookie Monster jumps over the fence and chases you. He will each and cookies of the path he is coming down and if he catches you, he will eat all the cookies you are carrying. The times for games seven, eight and nine are five, four and three minutes, respectively.

Game ten in the same as game nine (three minute time limit, you are Cookie Kid and chased by Cookie Monster) except the maze is invisible. When you pick up a cookie, the maze flashes for a second so you can figure out the fastest route to take.

You get one point per cookie in the jar.

For ages three to seven.</desc>

		<name>Eli's Ladder</name>
		<desc>This game was designed to help teach children addition, subtraction and counting. Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.

The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.

The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.

There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.</desc>

		<name>Basic Math</name>
		<desc>A very simple math game for kids.

Each game of Basic Math gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, and inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty.  The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function.  Games 1 - 4 allow you to select one of the numbers you will be working with, while 5 - 8 give random questions.   

Hint: For division problems that have a remainder make sure to put a space between the whole number and the remainder, which goes to the right.</desc>

		<name>Glib : Video Word Game</name>
		<desc>This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.

The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls a "Zapper" similar to a spaceship that can move on the screen and pull up, left and right. The goal is to draw the letters that spell out the current word in order, while avoiding the asteroids in the lower part of the screen. There are four types of asteroids and each has a different effect if it comes into contact with the Zapper. The asteroid "Doomsday" ends the game. The asteroid "Scroller" mixes scrolling letters for five seconds. Asteroids "Zonker" and "Bonker" hit the Zapper sideways.
The game ends after being hit by an apocalyptic asteroid, after the end of the time limit of 99 seconds or the ultimate goal of ending three words.</desc>

		<desc>The game is similar to the traditional game of tic-tac-toe, but is played on four 4x4 grids stacked vertically; it is basically a computerized version of the board game Qubic using traditional tic-tac-toe notation and layout. To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3Ã—3 board. The game has nine variations: it can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.</desc>

		<name>The A-Team</name>
		<desc>If The A-Team looks familiar it's because it is little more than a graphic hack of another unreleased Atari game called Saboteur.  At one point it was thought these games were the same except for the graphics, but after analyzing them I've found some slight gameplay differences.  On this page I'll concentrate on the differences between Saboteur and The A-Team, for more information on the gameplay itself look at the Saboteur page.  

It's unknown why Atari decided to change Saboteur into The A-Team, but we assume it's because they wanted a game based on the then popular A-Team TV show and didn't want to wait for a new game to be developed.  At that point Saboteur was ready for release and Atari decided that they would attempt to integrate A-Team characters into a game that was already finished.  The results are interesting at best, confusing to say the least.</desc>

		<name>Saboteur</name>
		<desc>You are Hotot, a cybernetic life form from a serene planet in a distant galaxy. Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.

On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.

In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you must destroy the warhead one-on-one.

In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course, the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.</desc>

		<desc>An evil magician has stolen the Enchanted Chalice and has hidden it somewhere in the Kingdom. The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs. 

This is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgie, the Yellow Dragon, who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.

There are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).

The Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom

Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</desc>

		<desc>An evil magician has stolen the Enchanted Chalice and has hidden it somewhere in the Kingdom. The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs. 

This is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgie, the Yellow Dragon, who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.

There are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).

The Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom

Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</desc>

		<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>

		<desc>The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.

There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.

The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.

There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</desc>

		<name>Air-Sea Battle</name>
		<desc>Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game.  On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen.  The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.

In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft.  You are stationary.   Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile.  

In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above.  On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen.  Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above.  Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.
 
In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again.  This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits).  The controls are as in games 1-6.  

In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above.  Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed.  When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired.  

In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below.  The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18.  The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below.  

In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.

Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds.  (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets.  I have yet to see this happen.)  In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a computer opponent that simply constantly fires.</desc>

		<desc>In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs). 

If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.

After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</desc>

		<desc>There are six Core nuclear bases on the planet's surface. You must burrow underground to each of these bases and destroy them. But be warned, they are guarded by patrolling Core Ranger tanks that if they get you in their line of fire, will destroy you.

There are two types of tanks. The white Sentry tanks only move through existing tunnels and will only fire on you if there is clear space between you and them. The blue Digger tanks will create their own tunnels to pursue you. There is also a Sentry tank at the bottom of the screen that slowly moves towards your reserve tanks. If this tank reaches you reserves before you destroy all six bases, you lose a life. The game is over if you lose all lives.

There are enemy supplies buried in random areas that if you get them will get you bonus points. Later levels have the bases only appear one at a time or have no dirt between you and the enemy tanks, leaving them to pursue you from the start.</desc>

		<desc>This game is based on the Steven Spielberg movie of the same name but is different than the other versions.

In this version, on the first screen, Mogwai are jumping from the roof to get at hamburgers on the ground. You, as Billy, must catch them before the hit the ground. If you get them all, it is off to the next, faster, level. If you miss eight, then you go to a shooting screen.

On the shooting screen, gremlins are approaching from the distance. You must shoot them before they reach you. If one reaches you, you lose a life. After they are all dead, it is back to the first screen at a faster level. In later levels, puddles of water will divide the gremlins in two.</desc>

		<desc>River Raid is a vertically scrolling action game. You fly a jet up a river in an attempt to destroy bridges which are vital to the enemy. The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.</desc>

		<name>Pitfall! : Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure</name>
		<desc>Pitfall! is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep in the jungle. With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</desc>

		<desc>You are lost in the deepest part of the jungle. Six of your friends have fallen under the spell of the Alligator People. They are slowly being transformed into alligators and you are the only one in the world who can save them!

To stop this transformation, you must inoculate each of them with a special antidote that you gather throughout the swamp. You don't have a lot of time! Not to mention, the alligators are chasing you as you attempt to gather vials of the antidote! The longer you wait, the more antidote you need to reverse the effects of the Alligator People!

Alligator People is an unreleased prototype based on the movie of the same name.</desc>

		<desc>An evil magician has stolen the Enchanted Chalice and has hidden it somewhere in the Kingdom. The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs. 

This is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgie, the Yellow Dragon, who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.

There are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).

The Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom

Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</desc>

		<name>Asteroids</name>
		<desc>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name.

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon.  When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.

Game Difficulty and Variations
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 

The game also offers three different game variations:

1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.

2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.

3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.

Scoring
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.

1. Small saucer - 1,000 points
2. Other player's ship - 500 points
3. Large saucer - 200 points
4. Small asteroid - 100 points
5. Medium asteroid  - 50 points
6. Large asteroid - 20 points</desc>

		<desc>In Fishing, your goal is to be the first of two players to catch 99 pounds of fish. Each player is on a dock at the top of the screen, and you control the fishing line in the water. By moving the fishing line up or down, you can catch the fish that are swimming by. The deeper down you go, the bigger the fish are. When you catch a fish, you need to real it in! To make the game more difficult, a shark is constantly swimming back and forth. If you have a fish on your line and it touches the shark, the shark will eat it and you then will have to catch another fish. Two difficulty levels are available, and the game can be played by one person against the computer or two players against each other.</desc>

		<desc>Coca-Cola asked Atari to create a game cartridge for Coca-Cola's Atlanta employees. So Atari went and altered Space Invaders. In this hack, the first five aliens are replaced by the letters P-E-P-S-I. The space ship that moves across the top has also been redesigned as the Pepsi red-white-and-blue circle logo. You have unlimited lives but only a three minute time limit to play. After the time runs out the game will flash with the words "Coke wins" at the top.</desc>

		<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>

		<name>Armor Ambush</name>
		<desc>Armor Ambush is a game that gives players control over tanks that battle one another over terrain that offers varying degrees of texture and traversability. Dueling tanks was a theme familiar to owners of the Atari 2600 since Combat, the game packaged with nearly every Atari 2600 system, had a very similar premise. However, Armor Ambush expands upon the simple battles available to players of Combat. The game takes place on a different randomly selected battlefield each round. Additionally, players can drop mines on the battlefield by simultaneously pressing the fire button and pulling down on the joystick. The mines remain active for the duration of the battle, destroying either tank that runs over them. Players are able to control two tanks and switch between them on command. The terrain is more diverse, featuring areas of foliage, water, and natural barriers. But as with "Combat", there is no AI for the computer, and the game cannot be played solo.</desc>

Players take turns firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</desc>

When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</desc>

		<name>Assault</name>
		<desc>A mothership drops aliens, up to three on screen at a time. There are ten per level. You must shoot them but avoid the items they fire at you. You fire by pushing up on the joystick. Pushing left or right makes you go left or right. If you hold down the button, pushing left or right makes you fire left or right.

Later enemies will drop fireballs that chase you along the ground or split in two smaller enemies when shot. If you fire non-stop, you will build up heat as indicated by the green bar at the bottom right.

If you overheat or are hit by an enemy, you loser a life. The game is over when you lose all lives or reach a score of 999,999. You get a new man (4 max) every 10,000 points.</desc>

		<desc>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name.

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon.  When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.

Game Difficulty and Variations
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 

The game also offers three different game variations:

1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.

2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.

3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.

Scoring
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.

1. Small saucer - 1,000 points
2. Other player's ship - 500 points
3. Large saucer - 200 points
4. Small asteroid - 100 points
5. Medium asteroid  - 50 points

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.

Game Difficulty and Variations
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 

The game also offers three different game variations:

1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.

2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.

3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.

Scoring
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.

1. Small saucer - 1,000 points
2. Other player's ship - 500 points
3. Large saucer - 200 points
4. Small asteroid - 100 points
5. Medium asteroid  - 50 points
6. Large asteroid - 20 points</desc>

		<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>

		<desc>The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base. 

The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</desc>

		<name>Atari Video Cube</name>
		<desc>In this game, you control Marvin the Cube Master. You move him around a six-sided cube with nine squares to a side.
The object is to get all nine sides to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, depending on the game variation you select.

Marvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire button. Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is.

To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate.

The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves.
Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't know what color your on.
Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces.

Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.</desc>

		<desc>The 2003 Holiday GreetingCart was part of a promotion in the AtariAge Store during the 2003 holiday sale. The Holiday GreetingCart is an Atari 2600 cartridge with a unique, holiday-themed label created by artist Dave Exton. When plugged into an Atari 2600, the cartridge displays a rendition of the same image, courtesy of Interleaved ChronoColour(tm) technology. These carts were individually numbered and there were only two ways of getting one: By placing an order of $50 or more in the AtariAge Store, or by participating in the 2003 AtariAge Holiday GreetingCart Contest and winning one for free!</desc>

These carts were individually numbered and there were only two ways of getting one: By placing an order of $50 or more in the AtariAge Store, or by participating in the 2003 AtariAge Holiday GreetingCart Contest and winning one for free!</desc>

When plugged into an Atari 2600, the cartridge displays a rendition of the same image, courtesy of Interleaved ChronoColour(tm) technology. These carts were individually numbered and there were only two ways of getting one: By placing an order of $50 or more in the AtariAge Store, or by participating in the 2003 AtariAge Holiday GreetingCart Contest and winning one for free!</desc>

		<desc>The 2003 Holiday GreetingCart was part of a promotion in the AtariAge Store during the 2003 holiday sale. The Holiday GreetingCart is an Atari 2600 cartridge with a unique, holiday-themed label created by artist Dave Exton. When plugged into an Atari 2600, the cartridge displays a rendition of the same image, courtesy of Interleaved ChronoColour(tm) technology. These carts were individually numbered and there were only two ways of getting one: By placing an order of $50 or more in the AtariAge Store, or by participating in the 2003 AtariAge Holiday GreetingCart Contest and winning one for free!</desc>

Sounds familiar? It should. Atlantis II is an altered version of Atlantis When Imagic ran the Defend Atlantis contest, they wanted to find the top four highest-scoring players and invite them to Bermuda for a grand finale shoot-out for cash prizes. The top two-hundred fifty contestants would get snorkeling sets and the top one-thousand contestants would get t-shirts. Unfortunately, more than four people maxed out the score on Atlantis so, to break this tie, all of these maxed-out scorers were sent snorkeling sets and t-shirts as well as a modified Atlantis game called Atlantis II. The modified game is faster, scores lower per hit and the score font is different.</desc>

		<name>Alien</name>
		<desc>In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs). 

If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.

After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</desc>

		<name>Outlaw : Gunslinger</name>
		<desc>You're a gunslinger in the old west! Outlaw features both one and two player games. In the one player version, your goal is to shoot a moving target as many times as possible in 99 seconds. In the two player version, each player tries to be the first to shoot his opponent ten times. Several game variations are included in both the one and two player versions. In the middle of the screen is one of several possible obstacles to make the game more difficult. A giant cactus, a stagecoach, a moving stagecoach, or a breakable wall all can block the target or provide some shelter for you to hide from your opponents shots. You also have the choice of unlimited fire, or only a six shooter. If you choose the six shooter, then each player must use up all six shots before either player can reload. And lastly, there is the "getaway" option. With getaway, a player may move immediately after firing; without getaway, a player must remain stationary for as long as his bullet is on the screen.</desc>

When the game starts, the bachelor has four lives. Every time he misses the Spanish Fly he loses one life and a musical theme is played. After each life is lost, you must depress the button again. When all the lives are lost the game is over. Small squares on the stripe at the bottom of the screen show how many lives are remaining in addition to the one then in play.</desc>

		<name>Bachelorette Party - Burning Desire</name>
		<desc>This was a double-ended cartridge that contained Bachelorette Party on one end and Burning Desire on the other.

Bachelorette Party was just a graphic hack of Bachelor Party with the gender roles reversed. The game play was, otherwise, the same.

In Burning Desire, your girlfriend has been captured by natives and is being burnt as a sacrifice. You are hanging, naked, from a helicopter and must put the fires out by, it appears, spitting on them. You then lower your erected penis to the woman who holds on to it with her mouth while you fly her to safety. You must do this all while avoiding the rocks thrown at you. If you get hit by a rock or take to long and your girl gets roasted, you lose a life.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2947. Earth is being invaded by the evil K’caj clan from the Yenrut galaxy. You are Galactic Commander Frank Drexor. The United States Space Guard has commissioned you with the task of defending the most important sector of the galaxy from the invaders. K’caj technology is much more advanced than the technology of Earth. Some of the ships have tractor beams. Others are equipped with subspace energy disruptors. These disruptors create energy barriers that will actually cause the shots from your cannons to reflect back at you! If your mission is a failure, the K’caj will gain control of this vital sector of space, allowing them to maneuver their troops and equipment much more efficiently and gain a larger foothold in the battle for the planet. This would certainly spell disaster for the citizens of Earth. Their fate is in your hands! 

You have a gun on the top of the screen and one on the bottom, each of which travel left or right. To switch between weapons, just press the joystick up or down. You must be careful when you fire because if you shoot your own gun, you will lose a life. There is a yellow spaceship that starts on the row next to the middle row and moves across the screen. Each time it reaches the screen, it moves one row closer to one side. If it gets to your gun, you lose as life. Later in the game, barriers appear in the playing field. You must be careful when these are there as they will reflect your gun's shots back, losing you a life if they hit. In the center, at times, there is a UFO colored either red, blue or green. The red is worth one-hundred points, the blue grants and extra life and the green resets the difficulty to level one without removing the points. Play simply continues until you lose all your lives.</desc>

		<name>Backgammon</name>
		<desc>This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual.

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:
All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.
No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.
A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.
After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.
If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Difficulty switches
Right:
A=computer rolls dice for you
B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers
Left:
A=computer sets up the board for you
B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

Game variations
Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player
Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player

Games one through four are backgammon
Games five through eight are acey deucey

Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.</desc>

		<desc>A mothership drops aliens, up to three on the screen at a time. There are ten per level. You must shoot them and avoid their shots. You shoot by pushing the joystick up. Pushing left or right makes you go left or right. If you hold down the button, pushing left or right shoots left or right.

Subsequent enemies will launch fireballs that chase you across the ground or split into two smaller enemies when you shoot them. If you shoot non-stop, you will accumulate heat as indicated by the green bar in the lower right.

If you overheat or get hit by an enemy, you will lose a life. The game ends when you lose all your lives or reach a score of 999,999. You receive a new man (4 maximum) every 10,000 points.</desc>

		<name>Bank Heist</name>
		<desc>You are a bank robber, driving around a maze of streets (representing the city) in a 1930's style car.  Your purpose is clear: perform "bank heists" by driving across white-pillared symbols that represent banks.  As you "rob" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments.  You must avoid the cops to stay alive.  Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can strategically drop to destroy the cop cars.

Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in Pac-Man), there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town.  By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city.  Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.

There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one.  Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to.  This keeps your gas supply high, and the money rolling in!  If you run out of gas, the game is over.</desc>

The game is played in two 4 minute halves, and the player who scores the most points wins. There are two different skill levels available which can be set individually for each player.</desc>

		<desc>You are a secret agent sent on an important mission to recover enemy documents. There are enemy assassins trying to stop you.

You move the joystick to move your character, left or right. Press the button to fire. You fire in the direction you are moving. When you are next to an elevator, you will automatically board it when it gets to your level unless your are pushing towards it, in which case you will walk across it. 

If you are on the same level with an assassin and there is no elevator between you, you can shoot him. If he shoots at you, you can pull down on the joystick to duck. You cannot shoot while ducked. If the assassin shoots or touches you, you lose a life.

Difficulty switch
A=Enemy shots travel the length of the screen
B=Enemy shots only travel half the screen's length

Scoring
Agent travels all floor levels, top to bottom or bottom to top=3,000 points
Shooting an assassin=250 points
Assassin is riding elevator when shot=75 bonus points added to assassin shooting points

You get an extra agent every 10,000 points.

		<desc>Atari Games' 3D tank game was ground-breaking when released to the arcades, and as such was converted officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.</desc>

The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occassionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you are Bopper.

The object is to stun then capture Beannies. You can also capture Bouncing Orange Eyeballs and various Falling Objects.

If an unstunned Beanny touches you, you lose a life. You don't need to stun the other items to capture them but doing so makes them slow down.

You get a bonus Bopper by shooting four Beannies in a row without losing a Bopper.

There are two game options, one where the Beannies bounce off the walls on screen, the other where they pass through.</desc>

		<desc>You are a local leading-lady and all the uptown boys are standing in line for a date, but a savvy soda-slinger just around the corner is more down your alley and you just can't seem to get enough of his famous fountain treats.

		<name>Berenstain Bears</name>
		<desc>In this children's learning game, you play as the Berenstain bear called Brother. On your unicycle, first you must avoid hitting stones in the road. Then you will be in the forest, where, depending on the cassette you have selected, you will have to catch the correct numbers, letters or the letters to spell a certain word.

After you catch the required items, you then move on and either have to dodge stones again or cross one or two bridges that open and close.

If you hit a stone, catch the wrong falling item or don't get across the bridge(s) in time, you get a warning sound but do not lose a life. You can play non-stop until you choose to stop.</desc>

		<name>Bermuda Triangle</name>
		<desc>Bermuda Triangle is a side scrolling action game for one or two players. You are the pilot of a mini-sub exploring the waters in the Bermuda Triangle. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by collecting treasures and destroying the various enemies you'll encounter. Your mini-sub is equipped with a tractor beam which can be used to collect treasures found along the bottom of the ocean; when you successfully retrieve a treasure, you will then need to carry it safely up to the research vessel on the surface. Your mini-sub is also equipped with lasers which can be used to destroy the many dangers you'll encounter, including giant squids, man-eating sharks, mines, bombs, enemy ships, and more. The game ends when all of your mini-subs have been destroyed, and there are multiple skill levels available.</desc>

		<name>Room of Doom</name>
		<desc>You are trapped in a room with a monster. As if that wasn't bad enough, there are gunmen outside the room shooting at you when the portals open. To advance, you must shoot the gunman when the portals are open. You can shoot the monster but it will only be stunned and if you stay in the same room too long, the monster becomes immune to your weapon.

There are sixty-four game variations. In some, the gunmen shoot in a straight line only, others they aim at where ever you are, others are slow, others fast, others the portals all open at the same time and stay open, others various portals open and close.

Scoring
Shoot a gunman=75 points per gunman
Stun a monster=50 points each time</desc>

		<desc>Dukes of Hazzard is a driving game with an overhead perspective, based on the popular television series of the same name. Players take on the role of the Duke boys driving the infamous "General Lee," while trying to avoid the police and rescue their sister Daisy from Boss Hogg. While development of this game was reportedly complete, it was not commercially released (and thus it never recieved a packaging design, official instruction manual, etc).</desc>

		<name>Space Invaders</name>
		<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>

		<name>Bionic Breakthrough</name>
		<desc>The Atari Mindlink was an unreleased controller for the Atari 2600. It was intended for release in 1984. The Mindlink was unique in that you had to move the muscles in your head to control the game. These movements would be read by infrared sensors and transferred as movement in the game. Games would be similar to ones that used the paddle controller, but with the Mindlink instead. Testing showed that players frequently got headaches moving their eyebrows around to play the game. Though Atari could have tried to refine the device over time, Atari simply decided to shelve the Mindlink. Two games were in development for the Mindlink by its cancellation, Bionic Breakthrough &amp; Mind Maze.

Bionic Breakthrough was basically Breakout controlled with the Mindlink, while Mind Maze was an attempt to use ESP through the Mindlink to predict what is printed on cards, which admittedly didn't work. Neither game would see release in a joystick or paddle controlled form in later years, partly due to the failing video game industry, partly due to the games' limited appeal.</desc>

		<name>Lost Luggage</name>
		<desc>You are at the airport attempting to collect your luggage from the carousel. However, the carousel has gone out of control and is tossing luggage everywhere! You need to catch all of the luggage that is tossed out, or all of your clothes will be scattered around the airport. As the levels progress, more and more luggage will need to be caught, and the games speed increases. There are two difficulty levels available; the easier mode gives you two men to catch luggage with, and the harder mode gives you only one man. Several other game variations are also available: if the terrorist suitcase option is enabled, explosive suitcases will occasionally appear. If you don't catch these, the game immediately ends regardless of how many lives you have left. If the suitcase control option is enabled during a two player game, you are able to control the direction your opponents suitcases travel.</desc>

		<desc>The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.

There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.

The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.

There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</desc>

		<desc>Protect the children and fight for your life "the night HE came home!"

Babysitting a group of children in a large two-story house, players assume the role of Laurie Strode as psychopath Michael Myers has escaped from the mental institution and has come back for revenge.  Players must guide the children to safe rooms while avoiding Michael Myers and his knife.

The house is large and full of dangerous blackouts and dead-ends within its sixteen rooms.  However, Laurie is not completely defenseless.  There is a knife that can be found to protect herself once the familiar theme music begins to play and killer remains in pursuit.  

Players will advance to the next level by either stabbing Michael Myers twice, or rescuing five of the children.</desc>

		<desc>Prototype for Freeway. According to David Crane, he got the idea for Freeway from watching a man trying to cross Lake Shore Drive during rush-hour traffic while attending Chicago's Consumer Electronic Show. 

Freeway originally featured people crossing the road instead of chickens since that was the scenario that inspired David Crane. However some people at Activision complained that they didn't like the idea of people being struck by cars, so chickens were substituted for people before the game was released.</desc>

The Holiday GreetingCart is an Atari 2600 cartridge with a unique, holiday-themed label created by artist Dave Exton. When plugged into an Atari 2600, the cartridge displays a rendition of the same image, courtesy of Interleaved ChronoColour(tm) technology. These carts were individually numbered and there were only two ways of getting one: By placing an order of $50 or more in the AtariAge Store, or by participating in the 2003 AtariAge Holiday GreetingCart Contest and winning one for free!</desc>

		<desc>Your girlfriend Daisy is in trouble! Ollie Org is chasing her across the top of the screen, and you need to come to the rescue. To stop Ollie before time runs out, you need to construct a machine. The blue print for the machine is at the bottom of the screen, so all you need to do is locate the parts which are hidden in the numerous houses in a maze like town. When you locate a part, drag it back and place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the start button and the machine is ready to go! To make your task more difficult, there are several obstacles that get in the way. If you enter a house which doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need to hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to time, a flower pot will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and you lose a life. You also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete; while he isn't deadly, he will occasionally appear and press the start button before your machine is complete. If this happens, you will need to drag Pete back to the bomb pit and reassemble all of the machine parts.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you ride your BMX doing various tricks.

The tricks are done in events of half-pipe, quarter pipe and ramps.
Some of the tricks you can do are loops, rotate, flip, and bounce.
In practice mode, you can select which event to do. In arcade mode, you do the events in a set order.

In advanced mode and later levels, you have to hit the ramp/pipe at more precise angles coming down and gravity and pedaling get harder.</desc>

		<name>Boggle</name>
		<desc>Boggle is an unreleased game for the Atari 2600 programmed by David Crane while he was still working at Atari. In Boggle, which is based on the popular word game of the same name, you must form as many words as possible from a random 4x4 grid of letters. The 2600 version of the game is for two players only, and each player can form a maximum of eight words (likely due to memory constraints of the 2600). The game appears to be fairly close to completion, although there are some glitches, such as all the letters not appearing in the grid right away when you start the game. Still, it's an interesting prototype and it's unknown why Boggle was not completed and released.</desc>

		<desc>This is a game rather reminiscent of Q*bert.

In this game, you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble.
The object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all on. You start at the bottom left. On the bottom right starts the Bubble Eater. He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.

The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt.

Game variations
The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three.

Levels
There are 5 waves per level.
Level 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on.
Level 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.
Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again.
Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.

Scoring
You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave.
You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are turning on a step a repeatedly.
You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what level or wave you completed.</desc>

		<name>Human Cannonball : Cannon Man</name>
		<desc>In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.</desc>

		<name>Human Cannonball : Cannon Man</name>
		<desc>In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.</desc>

		<name>Dodge 'Em</name>
		<desc>You control a race car on a four lane track, and your goal is to collect all of the dots in order to earn points and advance to the next level! The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants. Trying to stop you is a second car which travels in the opposite direction. This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn't in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.</desc>

		<name>Asteroids</name>
		<desc>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name.

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon.  When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.

Game Difficulty and Variations
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 

The game also offers three different game variations:

1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.

2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.

3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.

Scoring
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.

1. Small saucer - 1,000 points
2. Other player's ship - 500 points
3. Large saucer - 200 points
4. Small asteroid - 100 points
5. Medium asteroid  - 50 points
6. Large asteroid - 20 points</desc>

		<name>Space Invaders</name>
		<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>

		<desc>Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</desc>

		<desc>This release of Berzerk is an alteration of the official Atari 2600 version. Some minor tweaks were done like altering the color and graphics to more closely resemble the arcade version but most notable was that the arcade game voices were added in, saying things like "Intruder alert! Intruder alert!" and "Chicken, fight like a robot!".

The game play is the same. Eliminate robots on the screen. Do not touch them or the walls or you die. Do not let them shoot you. Do not linger in a maze or Evil Otto will come after you and he cannot be stopped so you would have to run.</desc>

		<name>Fantastic Voyage</name>
		<desc>Fantastic Voyage is a vertically scrolling shooter for one player. The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.</desc>

		<name>Yars' Revenge</name>
		<desc>In Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</desc>

		<name>Donkey Kong</name>
		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>

		<name>Journey Escape</name>
		<desc>You're on the road with the rock band Journey! After each concert, your goal is to guide the five band members to the escape vehicle so they can get to the next concert on time. You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<desc>Pitfall! is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep in the jungle. With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</desc>

		<name>Pitfall! : Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure</name>
		<desc>Pitfall! is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep in the jungle. With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</desc>

The Holiday GreetingCart is an Atari 2600 cartridge with a unique, holiday-themed label created by artist Dave Exton. When plugged into an Atari 2600, the cartridge displays a rendition of the same image, courtesy of Interleaved ChronoColour(tm) technology. These carts were individually numbered and there were only two ways of getting one: By placing an order of $50 or more in the AtariAge Store, or by participating in the 2003 AtariAge Holiday GreetingCart Contest and winning one for free!</desc>

		<desc>Your objective is to roll as high a score as possible, whether you're playing a one-player or a two-player game.  There are ten "pins" to knock down.  You have two tries (or rolls) to knock down the pins each time you're up.  Each game consists of ten "frames" (or turns).

If you succeed in knocking down all the pins on your first roll, it's called a "strike".  A strike is marked with an "x" on the TV screen.

If you leave pins standing, but "pick them up" on your second try, it's called a "spare".  Spares are marked with a "/" on the screen.

An "open frame" occurs when you fail to knock down all then pins in two rolls.  Open frames are indicated with a straight horizontal line (-) on the screen.

The ultimate goal in BOWLING is to roll 12 consecutive strikes for a "perfect" score of 300.</desc>

		<desc>Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a "knockout") or two minutes have elapsed (a "decision"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.
While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the "ropes" and "juggling" him back and forth between alternate punches.</desc>

A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a "knockout") or two minutes have elapsed (a "decision"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.
While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the "ropes" and "juggling" him back and forth between alternate punches.</desc>

		<desc>Bump 'N' Jump is an action racing game played from a top down point of view. As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</desc>

		<desc>In Breakout, there is a wall of bricks along the top of the screen and your goal is to destroy the entire wall one brick at a time! To do this, you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen which is used to reflect a bouncing ball into the bricks. When the ball hits a brick, it will destroy it. You start with five balls, and the game ends when all five fall off the bottom of the screen. Also included are several game variations, including breakthru (the ball will go straight through bricks instead of bouncing back), timed breakout (you have a time limit to gain as many points as you can), and invisible breakout (the bricks are only visible for a short while after one of them is hit).  Other variations allow you to catch the ball or control the direction of the ball.</desc>

In the novice game, you will be able to see your partners hand while bidding while in the expert game your partners hand remains hidden. For each game, you can choose to play to either 13, 21, 25, or 29 points. After a hand is finished, you have the option of replaying the same hand if you want to practice, or you can have the computer deal a new hand. If you don't like the way a hand is going, you have the option of restarting the hand to try again. Included with the game instructions is a complete guide to how your computer partner will bid in different situations in order to help you form your strategy. Bridge was designed for people who already know how to play the game, it won't teach you how to play.</desc>

		<name>Buck Rogers : Planet of Zoom</name>
		<desc>It's the 25th century.  You are Buck Rogers fighting the battle of Planet Zoom.  This is a race against death.  Your ultimate and most powerful enemy is the deadly MOTHER SHIP!

There are 16 levels of increasing difficulty - each with four rounds of challenging space combat.  Before you meet the MOTHER SHIP, your pilot skills and nerve are tested against deadly ELECTRON POSTS, ALIEN SAUCERS and smashing SPACE HOPPERS.  This is a battle of speed, accuracy and endurance.  Your time consumption is crucial to your survival.  

If you deplete your time you lose one of your five fighter ships.  The faster you fly, the sooner you'll get to the MOTHER SHIP, allowing yourself more time to destroy it.  You begin with a full time line when you destroy the MOTHER SHIP.  

Be aggressive but don't be reckless.  This is do or die cosmic combat and it's the MOTHER SHIP or YOU!</desc>

		<desc>You have been sent to a long-dead planet to investigate life sign readings. When you get there, giant bugs are there and will harm you as well as a mysterious Phylanx.

As the bugs come out of the ground, you must place your crosshair below them and fire. When the Phylanx appears, it will be green then will go dark green then red. When it turns red, it will move back and forth across the screen. If a bug gets all the way out of its nest or your crosshair is touched by a red Phylanx, you lose a life. Then, if in a two player game, it is player two's turn.

Difficulty switches
Left switch for player one, right for player two
Set to A for beginner, B for advanced.

Game variations
The only variations to choose with the select switch are one or two player.

Scoring
Destroy a bug=1 point
Destroy the Phylanx=5 points

After you score thirty points, you go to the next level up and get a bonus of 8 points.</desc>

		<desc>Bugs has stolen carrots from Elmer. Elmer's hound found that scwewy wabbit and dug him up. Now, Bugs need to dive back into his rabbit hole to avoid getting a cotton-tail full of buckshot.

You have three levels on the screen. You must select a level then press your button to steal the carrot. Once the carrot is stolen, Elmer's hound will dig where the carrot was, forcing you to come above ground. You must then make your way to the hole the hound dug and dive in to safety before Elmer blasts you. Once you have cleared all three levels, it is on to the next screen. If Elmer shoots you three times, the game is over. In a two player game, one player is Bugs, the other is Elmer.</desc>

		<desc>This release of Berzerk is an alteration of the official Atari 2600 version. Some minor tweaks were done like altering the color and graphics to more closely resemble the arcade version but most notable was that the arcade game voices were added in, saying things like "Intruder alert! Intruder alert!" and "Chicken, fight like a robot!".

The game play is the same. Eliminate robots on the screen. Do not touch them or the walls or you die. Do not let them shoot you. Do not linger in a maze or Evil Otto will come after you and he cannot be stopped so you would have to run.</desc>

		<name>Burgertime</name>
		<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.

The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.

The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.</desc>

		<desc>Rescue a damsel in distress from being burned alive by moving around in your helicopter and putting out the flame with your fire hose. Meanwhile, avoid the rocks being thrown at you by the bad dudes. When you've nearly extinguished the flames, the woman will begin jumping up and down. If you swoop down, she'll latch on to your "joystick" with her mouth, and you can fly her off to safety before the flames move in on her. If you save her, you will be rewarded with a dirty little animation. The male and female roles of this game are switched in Jungle Fever.</desc>

		<name>Cakewalk</name>
		<desc>You must catch pastries from six conveyor belts before they fall on the floor. Each pastry caught is boxed and put behind you. Sometimes, a knife and fork come down the conveyor belt. If you are hit by the utensils or miss a pastry, the janitor has to clean it up. If he has to clean up too many times, he gets upset and storms out and game over.

You can push the button to stop a conveyor belt for about four seconds but if you stop a second one, the first belt starts right back up. On games with belt speed up, you can push right on the joystick to speed up the belt you are in front of.

At the end of each level, you will have a cup of coffee come down the belt, but not fall off the end. When you grab the cup, you get and extra clean-up (life) and the next level begins.

Difficulty switches
Set the left switch to A to start at level five. Set to B to start at level one. The right switch is not used.

The are game variations that force the baker to pause when transferring boxes, making it harder, variations that allow belt speedup, variations with fast moving bakers and variations with all gingerbread men.</desc>

Using the fire button on your paddle controller, you earn points by dropping bombs into the canyon and destroying as many blocks as possible. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

This game is extremely limited in that it is played using only the paddle controller's fire button. You do not control the movement of the planes and helicopters, but rather you must time your shots to do the most damage.

The cartridge includes a secondary variation titled "Sea Bomber" that is a little more interactive. In this game, you deploy bombs onto seafaring ships, but this time you can use the paddle controller's knob to determine the depth of the bombs.</desc>

Crash 'n' Dive
As you fall down an endless tunnel, turn the paddle to hit platforms of the same color for points. You can also hit bonus platforms but beware of deadly platforms.

Cave 1k
You must press the button to make the helicopter fly up. You constantly move forward and must avoid obstacles, the cave roof and the cave floor. The farther you get, the more your points.

		<name>Centipede</name>
		<desc>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. 

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.
Dual Player Competition
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.
Team Play
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.

Scoring
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:

Centipede Head - 100 points
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points

		<name>Centipede</name>
		<desc>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. 

The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 

Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:

1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.

Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.

The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.

The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.

Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.

Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:

1. One Player
Two Player Alternating
Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.
Dual Player Competition
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.
Team Play
Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.

Scoring
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:

Centipede Head - 100 points
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points
Spider at close range - 900 points
Spider at medium range - 600 points
Flea - 200 points
Scorpion - 1,000 points
Flea - 200 points
Restored mushroom - 5 points
Destroyed mushroom - 1 points</desc>

		<desc>Released as part of a promotional campaign for Purina Dog Chow, Chase the Chuck Wagon puts players in control of Chuckie the Dog. Chuckie must be guided through a maze, avoiding objects and the dogcatcher, to the top of the screen where he can go directly beneath the chuck wagon to catch it.

Escaping from the maze allows Chuckie to enter a Reward Screen.  Here, Chuckie can find a bowl of dog food in the maze to eat for extra bonus points.  If Chuckie misses, no points will be awarded, and he will simply be sent to the next screen.

Chase the Chuck Wagon was available only as an exclusive through Ralston-Purina.</desc>

		<desc>The Spectra Island reactor provides power for millions of residents. Ordinarily, there is no problem but there has been an earthquake. This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a meltdown.

There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.

If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</desc>

		<name>Chopper Command</name>
		<desc>Chopper Command is a side scrolling shooter. As the pilot of a helicopter gunship, your mission is to protect the convoy of trucks which is travelling at the bottom of the screen. Each wave consists of numerous enemy choppers and jets which are trying to destroy you and the convoy. When all enemies in the current wave are destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult wave. To help out, a long range scanner is located at the bottom of the screen which can locate trucks in the convoy as well as enemy aircraft. Good luck, the ground troops are counting on you!</desc>

		<name>Chuck Norris Superkicks</name>
		<desc>In this action game you play the part of Chuck Norris on a quest to reach a monastery where an important leader is kept hostage. The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.</desc>

You must pop balloons by catching a clown on the teeter-totter and bouncing him up to the balloons. Use the controller to move the teeter-totter across the screen to catch the clowns. Each time a clown pops a balloon, the balloon will disappear and you score points. Each player receives five clowns or turns. If you fail to catch a clown on the teeter-totter he will crash and disappear from the playfield. Press the controller button and another clown will bounce off the trampoline from the right or left corner of the playfield. After five clowns have crashed the game is over. The clowns may land on any point on the teeter-totter except where the other clown is sitting, which causes them to crash.</desc>

		<desc>Aliens from the planet of Krytol are attacking your cities!! As the commander of a missile base, it is your responsibility to defend them. A variety of enemy weapons and planes will be incoming trying to destroy the six cities at the bottom of the screen. You need to fire missiles to destroy the incoming weapons. If anything gets through, one of your cities could be destroyed. When all of the cities are gone, the game is over. On each level you have a limited amount of ammo, so make sure most (if not all) of your shots are accurate or you could run out of ammo and leave your cities at risk! As the levels progress, there are more and more enemy weapons to destroy which come in at an increasingly faster rate.</desc>

You control Stanley and need to dodge the incoming coconuts. You begin the game equipped with a helmet and an umbrella to protect yourself. Each time you are hit by a coconut, you lose one of these items. You may also regain an item by scoring enough points. The game ends when you have nothing left to protect yourself and a coconut hits you. Of course, the longer you can last in the game, the faster it becomes!</desc>

		<desc>Mayday! Mayday! This is Colony 7! We are under attack by the Jarvians! Defensive shield has been raised. We will do what we can to survive.

This is an Atari 2600 port of a 1981 Taito arcade game. The Jarvian have attacked. You must defend Colony 7. You are manning the defensive guns that defend the colony. The Jarvians will send wave after wave to try to break through the colony's defense shield and/or destroy the defense cannons. The defense laser fires non-stop so you just need to use the joystick to place the cross hair over an enemy to kill them. If the enemies get to be too much, press fire to activate the Mega Blaster and destroy all the enemies on the screen.. Be advised that you only have three shots for the Mega Blaster. If the colony or cannons are destroyed, the game is over.

The Jarvian ships are:

1. The Fighter: This is the most common and several attack at once, firing at the shield and colony and, sometimes, your cannon.

2. The Advisor: This will cause the Fighters to target faster so remove it as soon as you can.

3. The Bomber: This one will not target the shield but will try to bomb your cannon. Shoot it and/or it's bombs before they reach their target.

4. The Scout: This one will call in replacement ships so see to it that he doesn't stay long.</desc>

		<desc>The 2003 Holiday GreetingCart was part of a promotion in the AtariAge Store during the 2003 holiday sale. The Holiday GreetingCart is an Atari 2600 cartridge with a unique, holiday-themed label created by artist Dave Exton. When plugged into an Atari 2600, the cartridge displays a rendition of the same image, courtesy of Interleaved ChronoColour(tm) technology. These carts were individually numbered and there were only two ways of getting one: By placing an order of $50 or more in the AtariAge Store, or by participating in the 2003 AtariAge Holiday GreetingCart Contest and winning one for free!</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2037. Nations no longer fight monster wars, killing millions. Instead, two combatants enter an arena and fight for their countries honor.

This is a sequel to the 1977 game Combat however, there are no planes, just tanks and missiles. Each player starts in a base in a corner, one in the upper left, the other in the lower right. You must seek out your opponent and shoot them three times to destroy their tank. If they are under trees or, in another game variation, behind walls, you must shoot the trees/walls out of the way first to reach them. Each player has three tanks. The winner is the last one standing.

If you are still in your base, you can press the button to fire a homing missile that will seek out you opponent. When the homing missile hits, it counts as two shots. Missiles must reload between shots and the reloading time is several seconds. If a tank is not hit for several seconds, the 'crew' will affect repairs.

There are game variations for trees, which you can drive but not shoot through, walls, which you can neither drive nor shoot through   and versions where you can place the trees/walls where you would like them to be.</desc>

		<desc>Your city is under attack by commando raiders, and it's your job to defend it! You control a large gun at the bottom of the screen. Choppers will be flying in paratroopers, both of which need to be destroyed. If a paratrooper makes it past your fire and lands, it will damage and eventually destroy one of the buildings in the city. After a building is destroyed, the paratroopers will then begin tunneling towards your gun in an effort to destroy it. Occasionally an airplane will fly by and drop a large bomb. The bomb needs to be shot before it lands, or it can destroy the entire city! The game ends when your gun is destroyed by a bomb or a paratrooper.</desc>

		<name>Communist Mutants from Space</name>
		<desc>Communist Mutants From Space is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. Your goal is to defend your home planet from the various mutant warriors which are attacking. You control an anti-mutant canon on the bottom of the screen, and need to shoot as many of the mutants at the top as you can. At the very top of the screen a Mother Creature will be creating mutant eggs that fall into the formation. The eggs will slowly hatch into various creatures which fly down and try to bomb or crash into your canon. If you destroy the Mother Creature as well as all of the mutants on the screen, you will move on to the next, more difficult level. Several game options are included which allow you to enable or disable a shield, guided fire, a time warp to temporarily slow down the game, and penetrating fire allowing you to take out several mutants with one shot.</desc>

		<name>Video Chess</name>
		<desc>This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.

To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.

Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square.  To carry out the en passant, you must advance your
pawn to the fifth rank.  Your opponent then has the option of moving
his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two
squares.  If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.

Skill levels
These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.
Level 1=15 seconds
Level 2=30 seconds
Level 3=45 seconds
Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds
Level 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds
Level 6=12 minutes
Level 7=10 hours
Level 8=10 seconds

Level 8 is a beginner level.</desc>

		<name>Confrontation</name>
		<desc>Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released, but was available directly from Answer for a short time.  Only people who saw it on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough.  I've racked my brain on how to best describe the gameplay of this game, and after much searching I've determined the best description is in Leonard Herman's "ABC's to the VCS" (pick up a copy today!).  Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players pieces at a time.  Take my word for it, they're really all there.

Confrontation is a very unique game which can only be played by two opposing players.  In this unusual chess-like game, each player controls four pawns and a captain.  The blue player's pawns are lined up vertically along the left border of the playfield while the red player's pawns are along the right. Blue's Captain is at the top center of the playfield and red's is at the bottom.  The object of the game is to move your four pawns to the opposite side of the board where they will be removed.  Once all of your pawns are gone, you must get your captain over to your opponent's side of the board and remove it also.  The first player to remove all of his pieces wins the game. 

Confrontation is a highly original strategy game in an era when fast paced action and shooting games were all rage.  If more innovative games like this had been released the crash of 83-84 may not have happened.  But as we all know the video game industry was done in by bad clone after bad clone, and Answer Software was not immune to its effects.  Games like Confrontation were left in dust, never even reaching store shelves.</desc>

You need to make sure you avoid colliding with the various enemies and their fire or one of your three saucers will be lost. Extra saucers are awarded for each 1000 points earned. Several game variations are included which control the game difficulty, the movement abilities of the enemies, and the movement abilities of your saucer.</desc>

Cosmic Ark features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at any moment. Then it's off to the next planet!</desc>

		<desc>Your objective is to roll as high a score as possible, whether you're playing a one-player or a two-player game.  There are ten "pins" to knock down.  You have two tries (or rolls) to knock down the pins each time you're up.  Each game consists of ten "frames" (or turns).

If you succeed in knocking down all the pins on your first roll, it's called a "strike".  A strike is marked with an "x" on the TV screen.

If you leave pins standing, but "pick them up" on your second try, it's called a "spare".  Spares are marked with a "/" on the screen.

An "open frame" occurs when you fail to knock down all then pins in two rolls.  Open frames are indicated with a straight horizontal line (-) on the screen.

The ultimate goal in BOWLING is to roll 12 consecutive strikes for a "perfect" score of 300.</desc>

		<desc>Cosmic Commuter takes place in the year 2075. You work for the Galactic Travel Agency, and need to help the citizens commute to and from work! Each level consists of several parts. First, you must successfully land the rocket module on the planet surface (this contains your astrobus). This part of the game is similar to the game Lunar Lander; you must control the speed of the lander to make sure you don't crash! In the second, horizontally scrolling segment you control the astrobus and attempt to pick up the commuters at the bus stops. Once all of the commuters are picked up, return to the rocket module and take off to transport the commuters to the grand central space station. Of course, there are many obstacles which can prevent a successful mission. Meteors, fireballs and space mines all get in the way and can destroy your astrobus. Your astrobus is equipped with a laser that can be used to destroy these obstacles. The astrobus also has a limited amount of fuel; if you start running out you better find more fuel before you crash!</desc>

		<desc>Here is a new game that will satisfy your curiosity and desire for exploration and will enrich your life for its colors and sounds. You, captain of a space fleet, enter into a universe tunnel accidentally where you are attacked from every side by foreign star people and UFO, who are firing one kind of energetic missles at you.When hitting the walls of the tunnel, the missles will bounce back automatically.
In the fighting, the colors on the screen will change with the appearance of the enemies, and the sound volume will be up and down alternatively, which adds tension to the fighting. For every 500 points scored, the background color will change automatically and tune will sound out to congratulate you on your excellent skills. For every 1,000 points scored, you will get another space ship.</desc>

		<name>Cosmic Creeps</name>
		<desc>Civilization is doomed! You are our last hope! You must protect the Cosmic Kids from the Cosmic Creeps as they escape the orbit-decaying planet!

The first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a little more

The second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.

If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start the Voyage again, only faster.</desc>

		<name>Cosmic Swarm</name>
		<desc>You are at the Waypoint Interstellar Trade Depot, a quiet outpost in space, when suddenly a dormant group of alien, mineral-eating termites awakens. They then begin haphazardly making their nest.

Using your probe ship, you must destroy the termites and their nest blocks. You simply fire at the termites to destroy them but their nest blocks must be energized before you can destroy them. To energize a nest block, you must hit a block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize all the blocks on the screen.

If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a block but you only hit the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not be damageable. If you run into a block, energized or not, or are touched by a termite, you lose a life.

Every so often, a refuel ship travels down and then back up the left or right side of the screen. You must dock with it (touch it) before it gets back to the top or the game ends, no matter how many lives you have left.

To fire, press the fire button. To move, move the joystick while the button is not pressed. If you hold down the button, you can rotate left or right then you will stay at that angle until you rotate again.

The points are:
Shooting a termite that is NOT carrying a block=1 point
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block but only hitting the termite=2 points
Shooting a termite that is carrying a block and hitting the block=3 points
Shooting an energized block=1 point</desc>

		<desc>As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.

You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.</desc>

This will drop you one step closer to the bottom of the screen, making it more difficult to destroy the incoming bugs! The game ends when six layers of the building have been eaten. There are four different color bugs in the game, each of which have a different pattern of movement. As the levels progress, bugs will keep coming faster and faster!</desc>

		<desc>The object of this game is to use your flying sub, the Sea Hunter,  to destroy enemies and get treasures.

You move fastest when in the air, half speed when in the water and cannot move forward when on the sea bottom.

Your enemies and their point values are:
Plane = 300
Helicopter = 100
Bird = 0
Boat = 50
Sting Ray = 20
Shark = 100
Angler Fish = 200
Squid = 100
Lobster = 25

You get 1 point for stunning the sea monster but cannot kill him. You cannot do anything with mines but avoid them.

The possible treasures and their point values are:
Sword = 200
Wine Bottle = 400
Sunken Boat = 500
Crown = 1000
Chalice = 2000
Pot of Gold = 3000
Key = 5000

You just play until you crash your sub or run out of fuel. You refuel by docking with the sub at the top of the sea (looks like a boat without a gun) called Sea View.</desc>

You cannot take all day because you are timed, as well. To make matters worse, in the later levels, you face moving spikes, Hurricane Man, who will try to blow you into a wall, and magnets that try to drag you into the wall. There are sixteen levels total.</desc>

		<name>Crazy Climber</name>
		<desc>As Crazy Climber, climb your way to the top of a series of buildings, where a helicopter is waiting to pick you up and take you to the next building. As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

1. Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
2. Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
3. Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
4. Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
5. Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
6. King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.

The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. 

Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</desc>

		<desc>When attending a football game, you had a valet park your vehicle. Unfortunately, the valet was a little disgruntled as he wanted to see the game himself. To take out his frustration, he has parked the cars so yours cannot be driven out until the mess is fixed.

This is a shifting-pieces puzzle game where you move the white cars out of the way so the horizontal white car, in line with the exit, has a clear path. Place the circle cursor onto the end of a white car and press the button to turn it from red to green. Then move the joystick to move the car forwards or backwards. You cannot move them sideways or turn them. Once you have cleared a path, put the cursor on the car you need to leave with and drive it to the exit. Free the car in the fewest moves in twenty-six levels.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, the player plays a thief who must grab all eight valuable objects from the "Mograth Stadtmuseum" within a certain time limit. Once the player reaches the top floor and has collected everything, they escape with a helicopter and the next level starts.

While sneaking around the museum, players have to avoid dogs and guards. The guards appear in the windows from time to time and can be avoided by standing between two windows. A new floor can be reached by running to the end of the current one and jumping through the hole.

After the level is completed, the score is calculated by adding your remaining time and a new and harder round begins.</desc>

		<desc>It seems as if forever that the evil Morplus from the planet Tzoris have terrorized the galaxy, leaving death and destruction in their wake. But now, our scientists have developed our newest weapon, the Spectron! You will be deployed with this weapon and must destroy as many Morplus as you can.

You have two lasers, one at the top that fires down and one at the bottom that fires up. You control both lasers. Depending on what you select, you can have both lasers stay parallel to each other or move opposite of each other. Your goal is to fire the laser, which fires from one laser to the other, and destroy any enemies caught in your crossfire. The mothership that drops the enemies is indestructible.

Be aware, however, that if you fire you weapon non-stop, it will overheat and then will not fire until it cools a little. Also be aware of the amount of fuel you have because if you run out of fuel, you lose one life. You need to shoot any red fuel pods when they appear on screen.</desc>

		<name>Crossbow</name>
		<desc>In Crossbow, you and several friends are trying to cross many treacherous landscapes in order to retrieve stolen treasures from the castle of the Evil Master. All of the members of your party are unarmed, however you carry a crossbow. Using this, you need to shoot any obstacles or hostile enemies that may get in the way of your friends as they cross the screen. You see the landscape from a first person point of view, and one by one each member of the party will walk from the left to right on the screen. There are many different landscapes that need to be crossed, each with its own variety of dangers. There are deserts with scorpions, ice caverns, jungles with hostile monkeys, a lava spewing volcano, and even the heavily guarded castle. The game starts with two friends in your party, with additional friends joining after clearing certain parts of the game. The game ends when everyone in your party has been killed.</desc>

		<desc>You are a UFO. You must shoot tall and short towers above ground. You can shoot the short ones on any part of them but the tall ones must be shot at the firing spot. To shoot, you move in the direction you want to shoot, the press fire. You have to do this every time you shoot.

After you destroy ten towers, a tunnel will open so you can get underground. You will have three chances to get underground. If you choose to remain above ground, the firing rate of the enemies doubles.

Underground, the tunnel narrows after a time. If, after you hit ten towers underground, the firing speed doubles.

Points:
Hitting a tall above ground tower=50 points
Hitting a short above ground tower=20 points
Hitting an underground tower=50 to 360 points
Getting through tunnel safely without hitting a tower=20 points

After a certain amount of towers are hit, the ground turns from green to blue. When this happens, if you hit ten towers, you get an extra man. You can only have a maximum of eight extra men.</desc>

		<name>Demon Attack</name>
		<desc>Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</desc>

		<name>Custer's Revenge</name>
		<desc>You are General Custer. Your dander's up, your pistol's wavin'. You've set your sights on a ravishing maiden named Revenge; but she's not about to take it lying down, by George! Help is on the way. If you're to get to Revenge, you'll have to rise to the challenge, dodge a tribe of flying arrows and protect your flanks against some downright mean and prickly cactus. But if you can stand pat and last past the stings and arrows - you can stand last. Remember - Revenge is sweet! Every time ol' Custer scores, he comes up smilin' and right back for more. The higher the score, the more challenging the game action gets!</desc>

		<desc>Dark Chambers is an arcade action game similar to Gauntlet. You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<desc>Who knew? You thought you could play cards better than that when drunk. But now you've done it. You lost King Roland the Insane's black rose in a card game with the Dark Mage so you've been banished. The only way you can go home again is to find and return that black rose.

Use a joystick to take items, talk to characters and go places to find the king's rose.

		<desc>NEWS FLASH: GIANT WORMS ATTACK THE CITY OF TERIYAKI!

You command a tank at the bottom of the screen. You can move left or right but you are always moving forward. You can control the forward speed by pushing up or down on the joystick.

As worms move back and forth you must shoot them so they don't touch your tank. Also shoot any blocks in you path. Try not to shoot fuel pagodas. Touch them to refuel. You can go to the far left or right of the screen and not get touched by a worm but you can't shoot them when you are there either.

In the two player games, you have selections on co-operative or competitive. In co-op, you have the same points and fuel tank. When one tank refuels, it refuels both. In competitive, you each have a score and fuel tank. You compete to get enemies and fuel.</desc>

		<name>Deadly Duck</name>
		<desc>You are Deadly Duck and the object is to shoot your bill bullets at crabs, the bricks they drop and dragonflies.

Each level starts with eight crabs. The crabs grab bricks from the sides and try to drop them on you. You can shoot the bricks as they fall and the crabs but if a brick lands on you, you're a dead duck.
When a brick lands, it will stay on the pond for a moment, blocking you from moving horizontally.

On levels two to four, you have two, four and six dragonflies, respectively, moving together just under the crabs. You get ten points for shooting the dragonflies but this makes them angry. They then drop one, two or three bombs (depending on the level). If you are next to a bomb when it explodes, your goose is cooked.

The game continues until you lose all you ducks.

It's all enough to make you quack up.</desc>

		<desc>You have been sent to deliver a message. Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.

IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)

You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.

As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).

After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.

You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.

Game variations
After you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.

The difficulty settings are:
Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.
Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.
Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.

The difficulty switches are not used.
After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.

Scoring
Readiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.
Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.
Destroy the left or right generator=2000 points
Destroy the center generator=5000 points
Shield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.</desc>

		<name>The Activision Decathlon</name>
		<desc>The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 

The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.

For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.</desc>

		<desc>Defender put players in charge of a ship sent to protect mankind from wave after wave of attacking alien forces.

Armed with "smart bombs", and the ability to use hyperspace to move quickly around the planet, the player ship must fight against Bombers, Pods, Swarmers, Baiters, and Landers - that can capture the humanoids and transform them into deadly and relentless Mutants.  Fail to save the humanoids from freefall or Mutant transformation, and the planet is destroyed.

Eugene Jarvis'  Defender has been widely regarded as one of the most popular and addictive space shooters of the early 1980's</desc>

		<desc>Save the humanoids from the impending aliens in the sequel to Defender. The task is still rescuing humanoids before Landers can turn them into Mutants, while avoiding and shooting other foes, however you must now carry humanoids to safety through the Stargate of the title. 

Entering this Stargate not only warps you to the nearest humanoid in jeopardy, but can also warp you ahead (while on the first 15 levels) if you enter it with 4 or more humanoids, and give you extra lives if you warp with 10 humanoids, so there is a trade-off between guaranteeing the safety of existing humanoids, and trying to advance your position

There are more enemies on screen than ever before. The Inviso button makes you invisible to enemies, but also to yourself, so you will have to follow your bullets to work out where on the screen you are.</desc>

		<desc>Wham! Bam! Watch out, ma'am!

You are Demolition Herby and you're out to own the roads. You must drive around a square section to black it out; the object being to black out all sections. There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel. You burn fuel as your drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you gain more fuel. You will lose a life if you run out of fuel or are knocked off the track. If you lose three lives, the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</desc>

		<desc>In Demons to Diamonds, you control a laser zapper which moves horizontally at either the top or the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting objects in the center of the screen. Wandering back and forth in the middle are demons which can be one of two colors. If you shoot a demon that is the same color as your zapper, it will turn into a diamond. Shooting the diamond before it disappears will earn you bonus points. If you shoot a demon of the opposite color, it will instead turn into a skull which will rapidly fire at your zapper. You begin the game with five zappers, and the game ends when all five have been destroyed by skulls. The game can be played by one or two players, and several game variations are included to set the level of difficulty.</desc>

You are the commander of the Phoenix, and your mission is to reach an alien spaceship which has been draining your planets resources. The ship is guarded by four levels of bird like creatures. After clearing all four stages, the fifth level will be against a large, heavily shielded mothership. If the mothership is destroyed, the game will then repeat, but with increased speed and difficulty. To defeat the numerous enemies, the Phoenix is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field.</desc>

		<desc>Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh's great treasures are lost throughout the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>

The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>

		<name>Donkey Kong</name>
		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>

		<desc>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.

Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.

Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</desc>

		<desc>Dolphin is a side scrolling action game. You control a dolphin that is being chased by a giant sea squid. Your goal is to earn points by staying alive as long as possible. As you swim away from the squid, you will encounter schools of sea horses which form a vertical row on the screen with only a small opening to swim through. As you approach each school, the dolphins sonar will help you locate the opening; a low pitched sound will indicate the opening is near the bottom of the screen, and a higher pitched sound indicates the opening is near the top. If you miss the opening, the dolphin will lose speed allowing the squid to catch up to you! From time to time, a seagull may fly overhead; if you jump out of the water and touch the seagull, your dolphin will temporarily be able to chase the squid. Throughout the ocean are waves which are indicated by arrows; an arrow pointing the same direction you are travelling will boost the dolphins speed, whereas an arrow pointing the opposite direction slows you down. The longer you stay alive, the faster and trickier the squid will become! The game ends when all of your dolphins have been caught by the squid.</desc>

		<desc>Dolphin is a side scrolling action game. You control a dolphin that is being chased by a giant sea squid. Your goal is to earn points by staying alive as long as possible. As you swim away from the squid, you will encounter schools of sea horses which form a vertical row on the screen with only a small opening to swim through. As you approach each school, the dolphins sonar will help you locate the opening; a low pitched sound will indicate the opening is near the bottom of the screen, and a higher pitched sound indicates the opening is near the top. If you miss the opening, the dolphin will lose speed allowing the squid to catch up to you! From time to time, a seagull may fly overhead; if you jump out of the water and touch the seagull, your dolphin will temporarily be able to chase the squid. Throughout the ocean are waves which are indicated by arrows; an arrow pointing the same direction you are travelling will boost the dolphins speed, whereas an arrow pointing the opposite direction slows you down. The longer you stay alive, the faster and trickier the squid will become! The game ends when all of your dolphins have been caught by the squid.</desc>

		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>

		<desc>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.

Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.

Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.

In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.

Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</desc>

		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

		<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>

With multiple game styles and possible plays each game is something different. 3-point shots and fouls can be toggled on or off. Also, you have the option to change the colors of each team's uniforms.</desc>

		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</desc>

		<name>Dragster</name>
		<desc>Dragster is a drag racing simulation for one or two players. The object of the game is to be the first car to race across the screen in the two player game, or to race across the screen in the shortest possible time in a one player game. The joystick acts as both the gas peddle and clutch; you have the ability to shift from first through fourth, but be careful not to shift too soon because you can't downshift! You must also be careful not to rev your engine too much, or you'll blow your engine and be out of the race. There are two game variations included; in the simpler game, you just need to drive straight to reach the goal. In the advanced variation, you also have the ability to steer and need to keep your car driving straight between the bleachers and road divider.</desc>

		<desc>Your girlfriend Daisy is in trouble! Ollie Org is chasing her across the top of the screen, and you need to come to the rescue. To stop Ollie before time runs out, you need to construct a machine. The blue print for the machine is at the bottom of the screen, so all you need to do is locate the parts which are hidden in the numerous houses in a maze like town. When you locate a part, drag it back and place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the start button and the machine is ready to go! To make your task more difficult, there are several obstacles that get in the way. If you enter a house which doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need to hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to time, a flower pot will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and you lose a life. You also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete; while he isn't deadly, he will occasionally appear and press the start button before your machine is complete. If this happens, you will need to drag Pete back to the bomb pit and reassemble all of the machine parts.</desc>

		<desc>The object of the game was to take control of a dragon that had to fight its way through waves of attackers that came at you from the right hand side of the screen. Strange ball type enemies came at you but although they did not fire at you but they could destroy you if they ran into your dragon. Large saucers would make an appearance and these would shoot at you and required four hits to destroy them. Each hit reduced them in size until they resembled a small alien invader that moved up and down the screen. 

On the bottom of the screen a strange creature would attempt to make his way past you but you could bomb him as he crawled past.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon</name>
		<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>

		<desc>The king's treasures have been stolen! As the daring young prince, your goal is to recover them all. The treasures are being kept in various castles, each one guarded by a fire breathing dragon. Each level in the game has two parts; first you will need to cross the castle's drawbridge. You will have to jump and duck the dragons fireballs as well as avoid flying arrows to reach the other side! In the second part you need to collect all of the treasures on the screen and make it to the exit while avoiding the dragon who runs across the bottom of the screen. The dragons on each level have different patterns of movement and firing, and as the levels progress will become faster and trickier.</desc>

		<name>Dragonstomper</name>
		<desc>Long ago, a Druid magician created an amulet of great power that could subdue a dragon. Heading to the dragon's lair, the Druid accidentally dropped the amulet and it fell deep into its lair. Over time, the amulet imbued the dragon with cunning and power so that it began to spread treachery and evil about the peaceful Kingdom. The player's quest begins with the king summoning the player to defeat the dragon once and for all. Taking up the call to arms, the player begins by gathering their strength and fighting creatures in the enchanted countryside to build up enough power to become a Dragonstomper. When finally ready, the player moves on to an oppressed village near the dragon's lair in order to recruit soldiers, buy magical scrolls, and acquire medicines and elixirs needed to face the dragon in its lair. With all of his skills, training, equipment and soldiers, the Dragonstomper descends into the dragon's lair for a final combat to bring peace to the Kingdom.</desc>

With all of his skills, training, equipment and soldiers, the Dragonstomper descends into the dragon's lair for a final combat to bring peace to the Kingdom.</desc>

		<desc>Long ago, a Druid magician created an amulet of great power that could subdue a dragon. Heading to the dragon's lair, the Druid accidentally dropped the amulet and it fell deep into its lair.

		<desc>Dragster is a drag racing simulation for one or two players. The object of the game is to be the first car to race across the screen in the two player game, or to race across the screen in the shortest possible time in a one player game. The joystick acts as both the gas peddle and clutch; you have the ability to shift from first through fourth, but be careful not to shift too soon because you can't downshift! You must also be careful not to rev your engine too much, or you'll blow your engine and be out of the race. There are two game variations included; in the simpler game, you just need to drive straight to reach the goal. In the advanced variation, you also have the ability to steer and need to keep your car driving straight between the bleachers and road divider.</desc>

		<name>Joust</name>
		<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>

		<desc>Dukes of Hazzard is a driving game with an overhead perspective, based on the popular television series of the same name. Players take on the role of the Duke boys driving the infamous "General Lee," while trying to avoid the police and rescue their sister Daisy from Boss Hogg. While development of this game was reportedly complete, it was not commercially released (and thus it never recieved a packaging design, official instruction manual, etc).</desc>

		<desc>Dumbo's Flying Circus was scheduled to be part of Atari's children's series (which included characters from Peanuts, Sesame Street, Disney, Muppets, and Garfield), but for one reason or another it never saw the light of day.  Atari advertised Dumbo in European Atari catalogs and even had a prototype box made, so the decision to shelve it must have been made quite late.  Even though Dumbo was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be the reason why it was never released.</desc>

		<name>Dune</name>
		<desc>Dune is an unreleased prototype based on the 1984 movie of the same name. It appears that it was to be an action/adventure style game similar to Atari's classic Adventure, but given as the game was never finished, we'll never know for sure. Dune was designed by Atari programmers Bruce Poehlman and Gary Stark, but it appears programming was began by another party. This prototype appears to be only about 30% complete--the game engine seems to be done, but many of the gameplay elements and graphics are missing. Presumably this title was canceled with the Tramiels shut down 2600 game development and fired most of the staff.</desc>

		<name>E.T. : The Extra-Terrestrial</name>
		<desc>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is a licensed adventure game, based on the movie. The adventure takes place on several screens with pits scattered about. The object of the game is to find pieces of E.T.'s phone. Once all pieces are found, E.T. calls home and the spaceship arrives to pick him up. E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. 

The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving. 

Evil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<name>The Earth Dies Screaming</name>
		<desc>You are a space destroyer defending Earth against the Trillians.

The Trillians are using attack bases to launch Kamikaze satellites and Trillian fighters at Earth.

When a satellite/fighter gets close, your weapon will automatically track their vertical motion. You must track them horizontally and fire at the right time.

You lose energy when a fighter shoots you or when a fighter or satellite explodes on Earth.

If you see a fighter with a white stripe (the back of the fighter), keep it on the screen for five seconds and you will come to an attack base. Destroy the attack base to regain energy.

If you lose all your energy, you will explode and the Trillians will celebrate as...The Earth Dies Screaming!</desc>

In this hack, the first five aliens are replaced by the letters P-E-P-S-I. The space ship that moves across the top has also been redesigned as the Pepsi red-white-and-blue circle logo. You have unlimited lives but only a three minute time limit to play. After the time runs out the game will flash with the words "Coke wins" at the top.</desc>

		<desc>Edtris 2600 is an unofficial port of the popular game Tetris to the Atari 2600. As various shaped blocks fall from the top of the screen, stack them so they form a solid line across, at which point the solid line will disappear. If the stacks reach the top of the screen, the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>Eggomania is similar to the game Kaboom. At the top of the screen is a bird which is throwing eggs at you! You need to catch them in your hat before they hit the bottom of the screen. If you miss any eggs, they will break and yolk starts collecting at the bottom of the screen. Miss too many, and the game will be over. At the end of each round you will be given an opportunity to earn bonus points; you now get to throw all of the eggs you caught back at the bird! As the levels progress, the games speed will increase. There are two difficulty levels available, in the easier variation you get a larger hat to catch the eggs with.</desc>

		<desc>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.nnnnEnemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: shooting them with his gun, kicking them by jumping onto them, shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them and crushing them with an elevator.nnnnWhenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.</desc>

		<name>Elk Attack</name>
		<desc>With a name like Elk Attack you'd probably expect a game involving herds of deadly rampaging elk right?  Well I hate disappoint you but there aren't herds of rampaging elk in this game, in fact this game has nothing to do with elks at all!  Elk Attack is really a port of the obscure Taito arcade game Electric Yo-Yo! Programmer Mark Hahn named the game Elk Attack as a joke, and probably would have changed the name had it been published.

Silly name aside, Elk Attack is really a Pac-Man type game but without a maze.  You control a Yo-Yo type machine, which must use its string to latch onto and destroy all the colored blocks on the screen.  Along the way you'll encounter strange worm like creatures (sorry no elks), which will attempt to disrupt your Yo-Yo.  To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and increase your speed.   However unlike Pac-Man touching a worm while invincible will only net you points, and will not destroy of them.  Because of this its best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down the worms.

Since you use your string as your main means of propulsion, you must be careful as the screen becomes more and more open. For once you latch onto a block you can't let go until you touch it.  The most common way of dying is to accidentally latch onto a block on the other side of the screen and be sucked into a waiting enemy.  Clearing the board in a set pattern is the best way to avoid leaving large (and potentially dangerous) gaps between blocks.</desc>

		<name>Encounter at L5</name>
		<desc>Using an anti-matter launcher, you must defend the starbase L5 against a non-stop horde of blue Megalyte warrior ships and their death ships. As the warriors reach the bottom, they fire on your base. It does not hurt the base but would lose you one of your four lives. Sometimes the death ship takes a dive towards your base, firing as it goes. If it reaches your base, it will destroy your generator, losing you a life.

As hordes of Megalye ships descend, you can hold down the fire button. This will keep the anti-matter launcher in place and moving the paddle will shift the cursor and thus your aim. If you are in danger of being shot or need to destroy a death ship, just release the button and then you can move the launcher left or right.

There are 26 game variations. The odd numbered ones are one player, the even numbered are two player.

Scoring
You score ten points for each death ship you destroy
Your points vary for the warrior ships. The farther from you they are, the more the points.</desc>

If you succeed, you get to continue on, fail and you are out of the race. The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes, the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.</desc>

		<desc>What started out as a nice little archaeological expedition has suddenly become a nightmarish fight for survival! A team of archaeologists is trapped in an underground maze of dark, winding tunnels. All around them, fearsome zombies are emerging from the crypts. The archaeologists' only hope of survival (apart from some very fast running) is an ancient device known as the 'make-break', which can be used to either create or destroy pieces of wall.

In this increasingly frantic one or two-player arcade game, you'll need wits as well as dexterity. You'll have to think on the fly, plan strategically and race through the maze as fast as you can. Fail to keep up the pace and you're zombie fodder. Good luck!</desc>

		<name>Escape from the Mindmaster</name>
		<desc>You've been abducted! Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.

You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.

There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:
Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.
Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow
Maze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence
Maze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once
Maze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.

You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.

		<name>Escape from the Mindmaster</name>
		<desc>You've been abducted! Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.

You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.

There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:
Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.
Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow
Maze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence
Maze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once
Maze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.

You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze.

		<desc>You are a space attack pilot flying at death range over a gigantic space ship. You must fight through the never ending waves of enemy craft while also firing missiles at the ship itself. Good luck!

You control your ship with the joystick. To fire, simply press the button. You will fire lasers and missiles simultaneously. The missiles will strike where the cross hair in front of your ship is at the time they are launched. Beware of shots fired at you and do not run into anything that flies.</desc>

		<name>Haunted House</name>
		<desc>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the  four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.

The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!

You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter so be careful! You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score!</desc>

		<name>Demon Attack</name>
		<desc>Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</desc>

		<desc>Fantastic Voyage is a vertically scrolling shooter for one player. The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.</desc>

		<desc>As Fast Eddie, you must go from floor to floor, collecting prizes.

Up to two prizes will be on the screen at any one time on any floor but the top one. There are a max on ten prizes per screen. On each floor, a Sneaker stands or roams back and forth. You move to another floor or jump to avoid the Sneakers. On the top floor is High-Top, the tallest Sneaker.

You have to get at least nine prizes. After you get the ninth, High-Top will be low enough to jump over. You then jump over him to get the key above him. Then it is on the the next screen.

You get ten points for the first prize, twenty for the second, and so on up to ninety points for prizes nine and ten. You don't HAVE to get the tenth prize unless you want the extra ninety points.

After every screen, you get an extra Eddie; up to a maximum of three in reserve.</desc>

		<desc>Eat! Eat all the calories you can but watch out for the purple pickles. They stay with you and give you debilitating gas.

Food starts on the left and moves to the right. You move the mouth to eat the food; the more fattening, the better. After eating several food items, you get the message that you're getting fatter. Then a faster round begins or, in a two-player game, player two plays. The green pickles are fine but avoid the purple pickles. If you eat six purple pickles during the game, you will burp, ending the game. You will then see a closed sign for the snack bar.

The food calorie count, from lowest to highest, is:

1. Green pickle
2. Root beer
3. Cola
4. Soda pop
5. Hot dog
6. Hamburger
7. Ice cream bar
8. Milk shake
9. Ice cream cone
10. French fries
11. Pizza
12. Cheeseburger</desc>

		<desc>Jr. Pac-Man features gameplay similar to the original Pac-Man, but with a few changes. As Jr., you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.</desc>

		<desc>Neptina, Neptune's daughter, has been imprisoned at the bottom of the sea by Titans. Your goal is to rescue her by locating the scattered pieces of a magical trident! You will need to take the form of a dolphin and a bird in order to locate the pieces that are hidden in the ocean and clouds. When flying in the air, there are several screens that have clouds flying by. Touch all of the clouds, and the trident piece appears! Other birds which are flying around will cause you to lose energy if you touch them accidentally. Underwater, trident pieces can be found by touching the sea horses. Octopuses, sharks, and a deadly maze of seaweed will get in your way and cause you to lose energy if caught! When you have located all of the trident pieces, the cage holding Neptina can be unlocked, but if you run out of energy first the game will be over.</desc>

		<name>Final Approach</name>
		<desc>You are an air traffic controller at an international airport. You must guide planes in to landing safely.

Your first screen is the Approach Control Radar screen or ARC. You must guide the aircraft , using the cursor, until they are headed left to right along the yellow line headed towards the black stripe. Make sure the other planes are headed where they won't immediately head towards each other or off screen.

After the plane gets near the black stripe, move the cursor to the center red light and press the button. You will then be on the Ground Control Approach screen or GCA.  Here you must center the plane's nose on the glide slope and localizer before it arrives at the end of the runway. If the landing is successful, the plane will disappear from the ARC screen and a new one will appear soon to take its place. If not, when you press your joystick button and return to the ARC screen, the plane will still be there. If a plane starts flashing on the ARC and you hear an emergency sound, this plane has an emergency and must be landed first.

Scoring
Successful landing=25 points
Successful emergency landing if landing before other planes=50 points
Aircraft wanders off radar=lose 5 points

You get a control error (lose a life) if you allow a near miss or do not immediately land an aircraft in distress. You are allowed an additional control error (extra life) every 500 points.

Game variations
Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player.
Games 2, 4, 6,  and 8 are two player.

Maximum number of planes on radar:
Games 1, 2, 3, and 4=4
Games 5 and 6=3
Games 7 and 8=2

There are crosswinds on landings in games 3 and 4 only.

Difficulty switch
A=faster planes
B=slower planes</desc>

		<desc>A local warehouse has caught fire, and you're the fire fighter who has to come to the rescue! Your goal is to save the worker who is trapped in the warehouse; on the right side of the screen is a firetruck with an adjustable ladder. You can move the ladder to the appropriate floor of the building to climb up and rescue the trapped worker. Depending on which floors have caught fire, the worker will move to the lowest floor he can which isn't burning; you'll need to estimate which floor he'll be on when you position the ladder. Once the worker is safe, you move on to the next (more challenging) level. The fire in the building may spread quickly! If necessary, you can use a fire hose to put out the fire. Of course, you have a limited supply of water so make sure you don't run out! As the levels progress, the building becomes shorter and the fire spreads faster which means you don't have as much time in which to rescue the trapped victims.</desc>

		<desc>After your interplanetary craft accidentally enters a black hole, you find yourself in a different universe. This world is inhabited by strange, mechanical bug-like creatures. You find that this world contains both bad and good bugs; the good bugs have asked for your help, and you agree to defend them. Your first challenge is to rescue the Pixy; this is the last living creature on the planet and is guarded by a killer bee. Should you succeed, you next will need to fight off a variety of enemy creatures including a flaming pumpkin, demons, and coiled serpents. Each time you defeat the creatures on the screen, you can move to the right where a new challenge (and bonus) awaits! After you complete all of the screens of bad bugs, then the game repeats at a tougher difficulty level.</desc>

Enemies will come at you three at a time, and will throw discs at you.  You must keep moving to avoid them while also firing discs right back at them.  There are different doors you can enter that will teleport you to another part of the room, giving you a chance to catch the enemies off guard.

There are two skill levels, and the higher your score, the harder the game becomes.  Do good, and your enemies will move faster, become more accurate, and the discs will go much faster.</desc>

		<desc>Fireball is an arcade action game similar to Breakout. You are a juggler, and you need to keep multiple fireballs within the play field. You can hold on to two fireballs at a time, so be careful because if you try to catch a third it wall fall off the screen. Your goal is to destroy the bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with the fireballs. When all the bricks are destroyed, you move on to the next round and are given one additional fireball to keep in play. Five different game variations are included:

Firetrap: Two additional fireballs are trapped within brick walls. Once a hole forms in the walls, you will also need to keep these additional fireballs in play.

Marching Blocks: In this game, each time you catch a fireball the rows of blocks will drop down one level. From time to time, a mystery fireball may also appear.

Knock-A-Block: This is the most basic game variation. There is a solid wall of blocks at the top of the screen that you need to destroy.

Migrating Blocks: In this game, the rows of blocks move! Every few seconds each row of blocks will rotate either to the left or to the right.

Cascade: There are five additional fireballs trapped within the block formation! When you destroy enough blocks to release an extra fireball, it too will need to be kept in play.</desc>

		<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon</name>
		<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>

		<name>Flag Capture</name>
		<desc>Flag Capture is an action/strategy game for one or two players. Your goal is to locate a flag hidden somewhere on a 9x7 grid. Using the joystick you can move your explorer around the grid; on any square you can press the button to see if the flag is located in that square, or if not to receive a clue as to the flags location. If the square doesn't contain the flag, one of several items may appear: an arrow indicating what direction the flag is, a number indicating how many squares away the flag is, or a bomb which will cause you to have to start again. In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games: in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games, players take turns moving around the grid. Several skill levels are available which control the players moving speed, allow the flag to be stationary or move, or add an invisible wall around the playfield.</desc>

		<name>FlapPing</name>
		<desc>"The future of gaming can be summed up in two words -- Pong and Joust." ...with these prophetic words on rec.games.video.classic, "Otter" planted the seeds for the game you see before you now. FlapPing, at its core, is an oldschool Pong Deathmatch... but with a "Flap" button. Each player flaps furiously to prevent the opponent from getting a ball past and scoring a point--first to 10 points win (3 points in a "poorlords" game).

FlapPing features two primary game variations, a "classic pong" mode which resembles the classic Pong arcade game, and "poorlords", where each player must defend a wall in a manner similar to the arcade game Warlords. You can play another human, or take on all the AI might of your Atari 2600. The Pterodactyl of Joust also makes an appearance in FlapPing, adding an unpredictable element to the gameplay!

FlapPing is descended from JoustPong, the name Kirk Israel originally chose for his original homebrew game. Unfortunately, this name stepped on the Pong trademark owned by Atari, and in early 2005 he renamed the game top FlapPing so it could once again be sold in the AtariAge Store, complete with a new label and manual designed by Dave Exton.</desc>

		<name>Flash Gordon</name>
		<desc>You are Flash Gordon. Many spacemen have entered Spider City but never returned. Your job, Flash, is two fold. Rescue any spacemen you find in the tunnels of Spider City and destroy all the hatching pods.

The lower part of the screen is a map. You are the horizontal line, the hatching pods are the vertical lines and the Disrupters are the crosses. The upper part of the screen is the close-up of the action.

You rescue spacemen by touching them with your ship. You destroy hatching pods, and the spider warriors that hatch, by flying to the pods then shooting the warriors.

You can also shoot generators, patrol ships and debris. Shooting the generator will keep the Disrupter from moving about the city for a little bit but the debris never stops while you are within, so don't hang out in the Disrupter.

If you destroy five warriors at one hatching pod or your ship is destroyed when it returns, you will have a shield for a short time. There will be two beeps to warn you of the shield leaving.

The scoring is as follows:
10 points = Debris
25 points = Patrol Ship
70 points = Rescued Spaceman
100 points = Disrupter Generator

You get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second, 300 for the third and so on.

You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do that, right?

Every time you conquer a city, you get an extra man.</desc>

The third game has the computer controlling the players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish it to execute  and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game variations the timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of course, the team with the most points when the timer runs out wins!</desc>

		<name>Frankenstein's Monster</name>
		<desc>In the cold dark night you make your way through the ghoulish castle of Dr. Frankenstein. There you must prevent him from completing his creation.

Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.

You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.

You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points.

Game variations
The only variation is one or two players

Difficulty switches
Left for player one, right for player two
Set to A for a five minute timer. Set to B for an eight-and-a-half minute timer.

Scoring
You start with five hundred points.
If you touch a ghost, tarantula or spider, you lose 20 points
If you touch a bat, you lose 10 points
If you fall through a trapdoor, you lose 100 points
If you fall in the pool of acid, you lose 200 points as well as one life
Each stone you place gets you 500 points
If you place all four stones, you get a 100 point bonus for each unit of time saved.</desc>

		<name>Frog Pond</name>
		<desc>The history behind Frog Pond is a little hazy, it's either a victim of bad timing or of management/programmer dispute.  The premise behind Frog pond is simple, you control a frog who must try and catch various insects with its tongue in a race to see how many points you can score.  The game subject and total lack of difficulty almost guarantee that it was to going to be aimed at small children, much like Nick Tuner's previous game Demons to Diamonds.  The problem with children's games is that they're really not alot of fun for adults to play, and Frog Pond is no exception. 

If Frog Pond looks familiar to you it's probably because it's an almost exact copy of Mattel's Frog Bog, which was released for the 2600 as Frogs and Flies under the M-Network label.  According to Nick Turner, this is a completely coincidence and neither company had any idea what the other had been working on.  According to Nick he wanted to add more options and gameplay to the game, expanding it to 8K.  Atari wasn't keen on spending the extra money on more memory for a children's game, and refused to allocate the extra 4K.  Frog Pond was shelved and Nick left Atari shortly afterwards.

As you might expect the gameplay is very simple.  Every time you press the fire button, your frog jumps and shoots out his tongue.  If your tongue hits an insect you score points and your frog gets a pleasant snack.  The are several different insects to catch, which are worth varying amounts of points.

While the larger insects are slightly faster than the smaller ones, they still don't put up much of fight.  However if you take too long to grab your bug he'll fly away.  If you miss six insects the sun sets and the games ends.</desc>

		<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<desc>In Frogger II, you need to guide your frog to safety in three different locations. Starting out underwater, reach the top of the pond while avoiding dangerous alligators and fish (you can ride a turtle for safety!). Once on top of the pond, hop across logs, birds, and even a whale to the life preserver trailing behind a tugboat. In the third location you have to hop across a flock of birds to reach a cloud at the top of the screen. Each frog has a time limit to safely reach one of the homes on each of the three screens. You move on to the next level when a frog has safely reached each of the homes on all screens.</desc>

		<desc>Front Line is a vertically scrolling action game. Your mission is to infiltrate enemy territory and destroy their fortress. To reach the fortress, you will have to make your way through varied and dangerous terrain. Jungles, deserts, brush, and rocks all slow your progress, plus each area has numerous enemy fighters and tanks trying to stop you. To help get past these obstacles, you are armed with a machine gun and grenades; at some points in the game you may even come across an abandoned tank which you can control to increase your odds of survival. When you reach the end of the level and successfully destroy the fortress, the game will repeat at a higher level of difficulty. Gameplay is for one or two players, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>

		<desc>Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</desc>

		<name>Gangster Alley</name>
		<desc>S.B.I. (Spectravision Bureau of Investigation) file on Chicago Joe and his gang:
We apprehended Chicago Joe but in retaliation, his gang have holed up in an apartment building, taking hostage a dame and her kid. The following men have been positively identified:

Shifty
2. Scar Face
3. Mugsy
4. Lefty
5. Nitro Ed

Your orders are to snipe any gang member. DO NOT SHOOT AN INNOCENT! Watch out for Nitro Ed. He likes to play with hand grenades. One of those and you're pushing up daisies. Good luck.

You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your ammo is limited so don't fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof, will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to disarm him. You get money for each gangster shot. The values for level one are:

1. Mugsy=$20
2. Scare Face=$30
3. Lefty=$40
4. Shifty=$50
5. Disarming Nitro Ed=$100

These amounts increase for each level by $10.  You also get $10 for each bullet you have left after each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a nighttime level. In this level, you must fire one bullet to light up the windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again.
If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or you total amount if you have less than $1000.

If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he will shoot you and you will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game is over. And Nitro Ed will laugh at you. You start with four vests and can earn another at $5000.</desc>

		<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>

		<desc>Garfield was never finished.

As you probably guessed, Garfield stars the lovable orange furball from the Sunday comics (no not Alf!).  Garfield is on a mission to find Nermal (wasn't he always trying to get AWAY from Nermal?), and to accomplish this mission he's going to have to cross five different action filled screens while keeping a looking out for the nefarious Odie!  The movement in Garfield is a bit strange, you don't move left or right with the joystick but by pressing the fire button to jump.  It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but fits in well with the whole fence post idea.</desc>

		<desc>You are in your vehicle which has terrible fuel efficiency. A real gas hog. You are trying to travel along but there is one or more ships above you that are trying to bomb you. To make things worse, there are holes in the road and other ships you need to shoot so as to not ram them.

As you go along, you can accelerate or decelerate to avoid being bombed but be careful because you might ram some ships near the ground. You can jump to avoid them or blast them for points. You will also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or their value will be deducted from you score.

As this is Gas Hog, you will soon run low on fuel. You must get below ground via the occasional holes, to grab a refuel marker. Do not stay below ground, however, as you travel in the wrong direction while there. You start with four lives and lose one if you are hit by a bomb or ship or run out of fuel.</desc>

		<desc>This game has nothing to do with the Atari arcade game or any of the home-ported versions.

You are the great explorer, Sir Robert Wittenbottom. You have discovered an ancient civilization deep within the forest of a mysterious island. Since you're a likable old fellow, they have decided to induct you into their council of warriors. But first you must prove your worthiness by running the gauntlet.

You are given three glasses of water. You must run through the gauntlet to the ceremonial fires and use your water to put them out. You current glass of water will then be refilled then it is off to the next fire.

Of course, it is not that easy. You must jump over rocks and logs, duck under stones, arrows and tomahawks, and avoid hitting trees or touching the sides of the gauntlet.You can ease the thirst of the old men you come across for points but it will cost you water. The game is over when you run out of your third glass of water. To jump, just press the fire button. To duck, pull back then press the fire button.

Scoring:
Jump over a rock or a log=50 points
Duck under an arrow, stone or tomahawk=100 points
Give an old man a drink of water=250 points
Duck under the Secret Talisman=500 points
Extinguish the ceremonial flame=500 points

Difficulty switches
Left switch:
A=joystick less responsive, more challenging
B=joystick more responsive, less challenging
Right switch:
A=jumping and ducking more difficult
B=jumping and ducking less difficult</desc>

		<desc>Your friend is trapped inside Ghost Manor! There are five different screens you need to get past before you can rescue your friend from the top floor of the manor. The game begins in the graveyard outside the manor; here you play tag with a friendly rainbow ghost or skeleton which will supply you with spears you can fire at enemies. In the second screen, you approach the guarded entrance of the manor. Using the spears you collected, you need to shoot all of the enemies blocking the entrance. The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>

		<desc>Your friend is trapped inside Ghost Manor! There are five different screens you need to get past before you can rescue your friend from the top floor of the manor. The game begins in the graveyard outside the manor; here you play tag with a friendly rainbow ghost or skeleton which will supply you with spears you can fire at enemies. In the second screen, you approach the guarded entrance of the manor. Using the spears you collected, you need to shoot all of the enemies blocking the entrance. The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>

		<desc>Mouse Trap is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. You control a mouse in a maze; your goal is to eat all of the bits of cheese in order to score points and move on to the next maze. Wandering throughout the maze are several cats who are trying to catch you! Your mouse has the ability to temporarily turn into a dog and be able to chase the cats. To do so, however, he will need to eat the dog bones which are located throughout the maze. The maze also contains numerous doors. The mouse can move these doors to reconfigure the maze in an attempt to outsmart the cats.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters II</name>
		<desc>Ghostbusters II by Activision (the makers of the original Atari VCS Ghostbusters game) never even hit a store shelf in the United States. With the video game market (circa 1989) having shifted toward more advanced systems like the NES and Sega Master System, Activision felt it would be wasting its time releasing a new VCS game. Yet it was released overseas by Salu. In scenes inspired by the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II puts players in the shoes of the apparition-apprehending heroes as they descend into a slime-filled underground tunnel, trying to blast ghosts and collect samples of "mood slime." Ghosts will attack both the player's Ghostbuster and the rope he's hanging from, and the Ghostbuster's "courage" meter must be monitored as well (though that can be replenished by picking up "elixir" power-ups in the tunnel). In the game's second level, players guide a mobile Statue of Liberty through the streets of New York City (echoing the movie's goofy climax), fending off more ghosts with her fireball-shooting torch and trying to keep a steady supply of "mood slime" to keep the statue moving.</desc>

		<name>Gorf</name>
		<desc>Gorf is a game similar to Space Invaders, alien vessels approach closer and closer in their threatening row formation.

The game itself consists of four levels:

1. The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship &amp; shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;

The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;

The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading "towards" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;

The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.

Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</desc>

		<desc>The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</desc>

		<desc>Enduro is an action racing game similar to Pole Position. Your goal is to last as long as you can in an enduro race; each day of the race you are required to pass a certain number of cars. If you succeed, you get to continue on, fail and you are out of the race. The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes, the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.</desc>

		<desc>Hangman is an electronic version of the game hangman! Your goal is to figure out a word that the computer has generated by guessing one letter at a time. Guess a correct letter, and it will appear on the screen in the proper location, but if you guess a letter that isn't in the word then you are one step closer to being hung. Guess eleven incorrect letters, and the game is over. A point is earned each time a word is completed. Several difficulty settings are included which affect the number of letters in the words. The game can be played by one or two players, and in the two player version the words can optionally be created by one of the players instead of the computer.</desc>

		<desc>An evil magician has stolen the Enchanted Chalice and has hidden it somewhere in the Kingdom. The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs. 

This is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgie, the Yellow Dragon, who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.

There are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).

The Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom

Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</desc>

		<name>Haunted House</name>
		<desc>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the  four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.

The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!

You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter so be careful! You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score!</desc>

		<desc>Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</desc>

		<desc>Time Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.</desc>

Each horizontally scrolling level in the game is loosely based on a different James Bond movie. The levels included are Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only. Each level has a variety of enemies trying to destroy you, and a unique goal that must be accomplished to continue on (for example, you may have to land on a hidden oil rig to stop Seraffino, or find Stromberg's undersea laboratory and destroy it). If you can complete all the missions, you win the game! Good luck, Mr. Bond.</desc>

		<name>Krull</name>
		<desc>Krull is a multi part action game based on the movie of the same name. A beast and his army have traveled through space until finally landing on the distant planet of Krull and ravaging the entire planet. But there is a prophecy which tells of a king and queen who will someday take back the planet. These future rulers are Princess Lyssa and Prince Colwyn. But before their marrage, Princess Lyssa is captured by the beast! 

You play the part of Prince Colwyn on a mission to rescue Lyssa and destroy the beast. The game is divided up into several parts.

The first part takes place during the foiled wedding. A large number of slayers arrive at the castle, and you need to defeat as many as you can to earn points. But eventually Princess Lyssa is captured.

In the next section you need to ride your horse towards the Widow's web; on the way you can collect Glaives which may be used to fight the beast. Once you reach the web, you need to make your way to the cocoon at the top of the web in order to find the correct path to the Black Fortress. The crystal spider along with strands of the web make maneuvering your way around this screen a challenge. Once you know the correct path, you ride on to the Black Fortress. 

Here you need to use the Glaives you've collected to free the Princess from a prison, and then destroy the beast!  After successfully completing all tasks, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

		<desc>You are a diver in an underwater maze. Throughout the maze are valuable diamonds, and your goal is to retrieve as many as you can. In the middle of the screen is a shark cage where you begin. As you collect diamonds you need to bring them back to the shark cage in order to earn points. Swimming back and forth constantly is a deadly shark. If the shark encounters any of the diamonds, it will eat them; likewise you can also be eaten by the shark, causing you to lose a life. You have no defense against the shark, however you are immune if you are in the shark cage and the doors are closed. Somewhere in the maze the Loch Ness monster remains hidden. If you disturb the monster, it will continuously chase you unless you can lead it back into one of the caves located in the corners of the screen.</desc>

		<desc>Looping is an unreleased prototype for the Atari 2600 based on the 1981 Venture Line arcade game of the same name. It's unknown why this game was never released, as it appears to be complete and would have been one of the better titles released by Coleco on the 2600. It is fairly close to the ColecoVision version of the game in terms of gameplay, but is a difficult game, either of which could be a reason for why it was not released.</desc>

		<desc>An evil magician has stolen the Enchanted Chalice and has hidden it somewhere in the Kingdom. The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs. 

This is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgie, the Yellow Dragon, who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.

There are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).

The Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom

Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</desc>

		<desc>Mama Mia! That's a  lots a pasta!

Mama brings pasta to the table. You must either eat the pasta, toss it to Frankie the cat when he is at the window, or toss it to Sergio the dog when he is under the table.

You have four lives. If you eat more than 20 plates of pasta, you will burst (literally) and lose 1 life. If more than 9 plates of pasta are placed on the table, it will collapse and you will lose 1 life.

To eat pasta, you move the joystick to the right then the left. To toss pasta to a pet, you move the joystick to the right then up or down in one smooth motion. You must throw when Mama's back is turned and the cat is in the window or the dog is in the right spot under the table. If you throw food at the floor or window when the pet is not in position or if Mama sees you throw food to a pet, she will bring 3 plates the next time. Remember, over nine plates on the table and it is arrivederci una vita (goodbye one life).

To clear a level, you must eat or toss a certain number of plates of pasta.
1=31
2=32
3=35
4=37
5=40
6=42
7=45
8=47
9=49

The point value of each plate of pasta starts at 5 at level 1 and increases by 1 point per level, to a maximum of 13 at level 9.
You get an extra life at every 1,000 points. The highest points you can reach is 9,999.</desc>

You start on the right side of a room, randomly selected. You must make your way though various rooms, killing or avoiding the four robots as you go. You need to find the power center and shoot it to clear that level. You must do this before the timer at the bottom runs out. Once you shoot the power center, you will get the remaining time as bonus.  You are then sent to a new room to start again but now there are five robots per room.

Each player controls a cop that starts on the left, and the first player to make it out the exit on the right wins. The game also includes of variety of options. The maze can be completely visible, completely invisible, or have just a few parts invisible. With invisible mazes you can optionally have the computer provide a sneak peak at the complete maze periodically. To make your task more challenging, one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are caught by one of the robbers, you will momentarily be stunned giving your opponent an advantage. You can also give your cop the ability to set up a blockade to confuse your opponent. This will look like a regular wall, however you can walk straight through it. The games speed can also be adjusted, from calculatingly slow to extremely fast.</desc>

		<name>Masters of the Universe : The Power of He-Man</name>
		<desc>In Masters of the Universe, you control He-Man as he battles Skeletor in two different types of arcade action scenes. In the first part of the game, you control the Wind Raider flying towards Castle Grayskull. You have a limited amount of fuel with which to reach your destination, plus numerous fireballs will be flying around the screen trying to stop you and Skeletor will be running along the ground. The Wind Raider is equipped with bombs and guns which can be used to defend yourself from the fireballs, and also can earn bonus points if you can hit Skeletor. The second part of the game takes place on foot. When you've landed near the castle, He-Man needs to pursue Skeletor. Skeletor will be firing numerous lightning bolts which can be blocked with a shield. There is a time limit here, and you must get past all of the screens and catch Skeletor before time runs out. If you are successful, the game will repeat at a tougher skill level.</desc>

		<desc>Midnight Magic utilized the Atari 2600 joystick for performing simulated pinball functions, such as activating the flippers and shooting the ball. Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. Hitting all five drop targets at the top of the table increases the bonus multiplier (2x, 3x, and so on). Extra balls can be earned when hitting the rollover targets at the top left and right corners of the table when the bonus multiplier is activated.</desc>

		<name>Millipede</name>
		<desc>Millipedes, cousins of the Centipede, are all over the garden. This will ruin anything trying to grow there unless they are stopped. But there are other insects as well; spiders, bees, dragonflies and earwigs. Nature is dangerous. Luckily, there's a bug zapper that can shoot arrows at these insects and destroy them.

Millipede is the sequel to Centipede, and features similar gameplay, but with a new swarm of insects! The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen. When all millipede segments have been destroyed, the player will progress to the next, more difficult level. Millipedes and other creatures are all worth a different amount of points. Occasionally dynamite will appear on the screen, which will explode if shot by the bug zapper. With a well timed shot, numerous millipede segments (and other insects as well) can be taken out as they pass by.</desc>

		<desc>Bounty Bob has tracked Yukon Yohan into Nuclear Ned's uranium mine. Bob must 'claim' each section of each part of the mine...but cannot take too long in each area, or the radiation will kill him.

Taking the role of Bob, players must traverse through different types of areas inside the nuclear mine. In the first level, "Lift", Bob must walk on each part of the screen to 'claim' it. Avoid the monsters by jumping over them or grab an old miner possession to become energized and grab a mutant for points. Use the lift to reach the higher parts of the screen.

The next area is the Crusher, with the same goal as Lift but more challenging as the player must also avoid getting crushed. The last part is the Radioactive Waste, where the goal is again the same, but the player must maneuver Bob around the radioactive waste. In each screen, there is a timer in the upper right. If this timer reached zero before you claim all sections, you lose a life.

After you have beaten all three screens, they repeat but without any of the bonuses for energizing, so you must jump over or avoid all mutants.</desc>

		<name>Miss Piggy's Wedding</name>
		<desc>Miss Piggy's Wedding was a two-player game created in 1983 for the Atari 2600 console. The game was advertised in Atari catalogs, but never made it to final release, due to Atari's cancellation of their Children's series. A prototype of the game was discovered in the late '90s by a private collector.



The object of the game was for one player to maneuver Kermit through the church and outside to a waiting taxi, without getting caught by Miss Piggy (controlled by the second player), who insisted that they be married.



The obstacles to Kermit were the wedding guests (represented by blocks in the picture), who try to impede his progress through the maze. He also must touch a key in order to open the doors and escape, although if Miss Piggy touches the key, the doors close again.



The most complete version currently known for this game was never finished, so the consequences of Kermit escaping or being caught by Miss Piggy are unknown. Additionally, Gonzo appears at the top of the screen as the minister, yet he has no purpose in the game prototype.</desc>

You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat.

		<desc>In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

		<desc>Mr. Postman puts you in control of a mail carrier tasked with getting a very important package to a house in the City of Silence. The first step is taming the eagle that will carry Mr. Postman to his destination. This is done by climbing a tree on the far right edge of the screen, jumping onto a swinging vine and finally dropping onto the eagle's back, all while avoiding the bird's "droppings." Now, there are many things the nondescript white squares emanating from the eagle could be, and what exactly they are isn't important. What is important is that getting hit by one costs a life. So don't get hit by one. Oh, and while all this is happening your score is counting down at a pretty rapid clip, so no dilly-dallying.

Once you've secured your steed it's time to ride him (or her) through a thunderstorm, shooting hailstones while avoiding streaks of lightning. Once you clear the skies of hail three times you finally reach your destination, the City of Silence. Here you navigate through tight passages to deliver your package to its grateful recipients. Just like the first screen, your score ticks down rapidly here, so you'd better step on it.</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-man</name>
		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

		<name>The Music Machine</name>
		<desc>In this game, you play as Stevie and Nancy.

The Music Machine moves back and forth at the top of the screen, dropping symbols that represent good qualities (Fruits of the Spirit). You have to catch these in you basket. Once you have caught one of each of the other symbols, then the heart (representing love) comes down. You MUST catch the heart to end the round and go to the next round. If you miss the heart, you lose a life.

Just under the Music Machine is Mr. Pims. He tries to mess you up by dropping down his assistants, the Pudgeons. If you catch a Pudgeon, you lose a life.

The symbols and what they represent are:
Heart=Love
Snail=Patience
Lamb=Gentleness
Mustard Seed=Faith
Music Note=Joy
Harp=Peace
Gift=Kindness
Angel=Goodness
Stop Sign=Self-control

The points vary per level. They are:
Level........................1......2.....3......4.......5......6.......7.......8........9......10
Catch symbol=........10...15....20....30.....40....50.....60.....70.......80.....90
Miss symbol=.........-5....-8....-10...-15...-20....-25....-30....-35.....-40.....-45
Catch love=.........100..200..300..400..500...700..1000..1400..2000...2500
Catch Pudgeon=-100.-200.-300.-400.-500.-700.-1000.-1400.-2000.-2500

You get a bonus basket at 10,000 points if you have less the three in reserve.</desc>

		<desc>This golf game (as you couldn't tell by the title) comes from HES games.  It is a pretty decent little game with some nice graphics of the golfer and even two different views of the greens.  You get the option of switching clubs and you have the power bar to gauge how hard you hit it. If you like golf games, then this will be a welcome addition to your  collection.  I am not a big fan of golf games, but still play this occasionally.</desc>

The Holiday GreetingCart is an Atari 2600 cartridge with a unique, holiday-themed label created by artist Dave Exton. When plugged into an Atari 2600, the cartridge displays a rendition of the same image, courtesy of Interleaved ChronoColour(tm) technology. These carts were individually numbered and there were only two ways of getting one: By placing an order of $50 or more in the AtariAge Store, or by participating in the 2003 AtariAge Holiday GreetingCart Contest and winning one for free!</desc>

The computer keeps score, and gives you more challenging game action the higher you go!

This is the Atari version of the Intellivision game Astrosmash. There is a bug in the original release of this cartridge - when two controllers are plugged in and moved simultaneously, unpredictable graphic effects can occur, and the joysticks may stop operating until the game is reset. The bug was fixed in later productions of the game.</desc>

		<name>Private Eye</name>
		<desc>You are the great French private eye Pierre Touche. Your job is to capture the criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases, several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and how high you can jump.</desc>

		<desc>You are the great French private eye Pierre Touche. Your job is to capture the criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases, several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and how high you can jump.</desc>

		<name>Q*bert's Qubes</name>
		<desc>Q*Bert's Qubes is the sequel to the game Q*Bert and features similar gameplay, but is now in three dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.</desc>

		<name>Rainbow Invaders</name>
		<desc>It's the year 3006, and the evil “Rainbow Invaders” from the planet “Pacco”, are headed to Earth! They look like the ridiculous aliens depicted in 1980’s arcade games, but are extremely dangerous and their goal is to exterminate all humans! You command a fleet of spaceships and you must defeat all of the Invaders to save Earth! Good luck!

This game is inspired by the game Space Invaders but with a twist. Yes, there are rows of invaders moving across the screen then moving down, firing as they go. Yes, your ship moves left and right at the bottom of the screen, firing up. Yes, an enemy ship will travel across the top of the screen. But there, the similarities end. For one thing, there are no shields to hide behind. Your ship does have a shield you activate by pulling back on the joystick but be warned, it drains all your energy so when you use it, after it is gone, you cannot move or fire for a second.

Also, the aliens are not dropping just electric shots. They also drop any of sixteen Special Shots. Some of these will help you, most will hinder you.

The Special Shots do the following:

1. Your ship's movements and shots become faster. Duration: ten seconds
2. Your ship's left/right movements are inverted. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
3. Your ship's movements and shots become slower. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
4. Enemies do not fire. Duration: ten seconds
5. Inavders' electric shots descend at maximum speed. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
6. Invaders' electric shots track your ship. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
7. Invaders stop moving. Duration: five seconds
8. Invaders move very fast. Duration: one second
9. All shots, your and the invaders, become invisible. Duration: ten seconds
10. If you shoot at an invader or the enemy ship and miss, a randomly generated invader could appear. And your “Shoot Abort” option, wherein when you shoot again the last shot disappears, is temporary disabled. Duration: thirty seconds
11. Your ship freezes. Duration: one second
12. Invaders’ electric shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
13. Your shots follow a random path. Duration: until you grab a different Special Shot or lose your current life.
14. Your shots don’t stop when they hit an enemy but continue straight to the top of the screen, killing any enemies it hits. Duration: five seconds
15. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you don’t blast it immediately, every few moments a new invader is randomly generated. Duration: thirty seconds
16. A randomly chosen invader blinks. If you don’t blast it before the bonus expires, your ship will explode. Duration: ten seconds. Meaning you have ten seconds to shoot that invader or lose a life</desc>

		<name>Asteroids</name>
		<desc>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name.

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon.  When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.

Game Difficulty and Variations
There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. 

The game also offers three different game variations:

1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.

2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.

3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.

Scoring
The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.

1. Small saucer - 1,000 points
2. Other player's ship - 500 points
3. Large saucer - 200 points
4. Small asteroid - 100 points
5. Medium asteroid  - 50 points
6. Large asteroid - 20 points</desc>

		<desc>Sentinel is a side scrolling action game. Several worlds have fallen victim of an alien attack, and you need to free them. To do this, a glowing orb called the Sentinel has been sent which can absorb the alien energy. As the Sentinel floats above the various, scrolling landscapes, you need to protect it from attacks by using the light gun to destroy enemies and enemy fire. If you don't destroy an enemy, it will deplete the Sentinels energy supply which will eventually destroy it. There are four levels of increasing difficulty, each with a large boss at the end. To help out on your mission, several bonuses may be encountered from time to time; increased firepower and energy can be acquired when you shoot the bonus capsules that appear. Three levels of difficulty are available.</desc>

		<desc>A damsel in distress is being held in a castle by a fire breathing dragon! As Sir Lancelot, you need to ride your winged horse Pegasus to the rescue. Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</desc>

		<desc>Fly slalom around pylons (right of the red ones, left of the blue ones). Avoid skipping a pylon, hitting the pylons, trees or hot-air balloons. Try to get the best time you can. If you fly to the wrong side of a pylon, you will get a three second penalty for each missed pylon. The total number of pylons remaining is at the top of the screen above the time. If you hit a tree, pylon or balloon your plane will crash to the ground. You will not die but this will hurt your time as your plane has to take off again. Hitting a pylon will not hurt your pylon count. You will still get credit for the pylon but will lose time as your plane was slowed. You can press the fire button to throttle up or release to throttle down. Move the joystick left or right to turn. You bank into turns so you need to time turns as it is not instant. Up and down on the joystick do nothing.</desc>

For every caught star, a bucket appears to remove some of the water from the cavern.  Mickey also has the opportunity to catch the brooms before they get to the bottom of the stairs and flood the cavern further.

If Mickey fails to provide enough buckets, or stop the brooms, they will flood the cavern, and the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</desc>

		<name>Space Shuttle : A Journey into Space</name>
		<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>

		<desc>Space War for the Atari 2600 was among the first home adaptations of the classic mainframe game Spacewar!.

The cartridge includes two different game modes: Space War and Space Shuttle. Space War is the classic one-on-one game of dueling spaceships and requires two players. The goal is to shoot down the opponent with missiles for one point per kill. Each player's ship carries eight missiles and a limited amount of fuel for its thrusters. Once the ammunition has run out, it is refilled automatically, but only if the other player is also out of shots. The controls follow the Spacewar!/Asteroids model of momentum preservation: once accelerated, the ship will keep flying in the same direction until its thrusters fire again. Seven different variants of Space War are available, each toggling different options: the screen boundary is either solid and ships and shots will bounce off, or it can be passed through and the ships and missiles will reappear on the other side of the screen. If hyperspace is available, a player can become temporarily invisible, which uses a lot of fuel and disables the guns, however. If there is a sun in the center of the play field, its gravity will pull the ships towards it and crashing into it will award the opponent one point. Finally, if a starbase is present, ships can fly by it to resupply fuel and ammo.</desc>

		<name>Star Trek : Strategic Operations Simulator</name>
		<desc>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</desc>

		<desc>Star Strike was clearly inspired by the Death Star battle sequence in the movie Star Wars. You fly a space craft into the enemy launch trench. Your mission: to destroy the alien station before Earth passes directly over the launch trench. You must evade the alien ships that are defending the launch trench while being sure to bomb the red "Hot Targets". The very first red target that is missed when the Earth is directly in the middle of the launch trench becomes a missile. The missile is launched and destroys Earth.</desc>

		<desc>An evil magician has stolen the Enchanted Chalice and has hidden it somewhere in the Kingdom. The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs. 

This is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgie, the Yellow Dragon, who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.

There are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).

The Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom

Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</desc>

		<desc>This game is an altered version of the Atari 2600 version of RealSports Baseball. The game controls are identical. The alterations are that the graphics and colors were changed. Also, the options were reduced to one or two player and whether, in one player, the human player is up first at bat or not.

Otherwise, everything else is the same. You still can throw fastballs, curve balls, sinkers, etc. and you can still bunt, hit fly balls, etc. Scoring remains the same with a tie after nine innings going into extra innings. The difficulty switches do not have any use.</desc>

		<name>Super Cobra</name>
		<desc>Super Cobra is a side scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

		<desc>The Swoops! cartridge contains three games:

Splatform
Simply bounce to the right from platform to platform as fast as you can. Don't bounce in one place or you will lose points. Don't miss and end up below the screen or you will lose a life.

Crash 'n' Dive
As you fall down an endless tunnel, turn the paddle to hit platforms of the same color for points. You can also hit bonus platforms but beware of deadly platforms.

Cave 1k
You must press the button to make the helicopter fly up. You constantly move forward and must avoid obstacles, the cave roof and the cave floor. The farther you get, the more your points.

The fourth option, 3-athlon, allows you to play all three games in succession, with you final score being the total from all three games.</desc>

		<name>Time Pilot</name>
		<desc>Time Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.</desc>

		<name>Up 'n Down</name>
		<desc>This is a home port of a 1983 Sega arcade game that was distributed by Bally Midway.

The object is to drive around a twisty course and collect all the colored flags. You can jump over gaps and over or onto other cars. If you land on another car, you kill them and collect points. You can also collect things like balloons and ice cream cones for bonus points. The faster you collect all the flags, the bigger a time bonus you get.

In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you will need to jump on him. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. In two player games, play alternates.</desc>

		<desc>Vanguard is an arcade style shooter for one or two players. Your goal is to pilot your spaceship to the City of Mystery which is located at the end of a heavily guarded tunnel, and once there destroy the creature Gond. The tunnel is broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, rainbow zone, stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features different types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either horizontally or vertically. In the mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly through this, your ship temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped with lasers to help destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions, however your speed is decreased when firing. You also need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge; your fuel will deplete at a rapid rate, and your ship will crash if it runs out. Fuel is gained each time you destroy an enemy, so make sure you destroy as many as you can! When you finally make it through all the various zones of the tunnel and defeat Gond, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

On each side of the screen are five rabbit holes; the rabbits will come running out of the holes and try to steal the carrots. You need to throw rotten eggs at the rabbits to scare them away. Every time the rabbits get away with a carrot, a point is added to their score. Every time you hit a rabbit with an egg, you will receive points.  For every 100 points you earn, the rabbits will lose 25 points. The game ends when the rabbits have reached 100 points.

		<name>Xevious</name>
		<desc>It's dangerous, it's devious, it's Xevious.  Never before has a tag line so perfectly summed up a video game.  Xevious was one of the first (if not the first) in a new genre of arcade games: the scrolling shooter.  While we make take such games for granted today, back in 1982 such a concept was unheard of.  Most games of the time had only one non-scrolling screen, which seriously limited their creativity.  One screen shooter like Galaga and Galaxian were ok, but players hungered for something different.  Xevious satisfied that hunger.
It's a nightmare, but it's true.  Scientific research has determined that we are the actual aliens on Earth and the evil Xevions are the original inhabitants.  Now the Xevions want Earth back, minus the humans! Earth's last hope is an experimental fighter plane known as the Solvalou.  The mission is dangerous, success isn't guaranteed, and odds are this is a one-way trip.  But at this point it's do or die!
As Earth's last hope, you must successfully defeat the Xevion assault fleet before they reclaim earth.  However this won't be an easy task, the Xevions have had over a millennia to develop the biggest, nastiest, and most destructive ships Earth has ever seen.  Thankfully the Solvalou is armed with the latest in weapons technology which will cut through the Xevion hordes like a hot knife through butter.  The Solvalou has two main weapons, a laser blaster for taking out air targets, and a photon bomber for destroying ground targets.  Over the course of the game you'll run into numerous enemy types which can only be destroyed using the appropriate weapon, so mastering the dual shot (air and ground) technique is vital.
Toroid Fleet Ships -- These round rotating objects are the first and most common enemy encountered in Xevious.  Gliding in from the left or right, a small squad of Toroids come towards your ship before darting away from whence they came.  Thankfully Toroids don't pose much of a threat unless you happen to be distracted by something else at the time.
Torkan Scout Ships -- Torkan Scouts are similar to Toroids except if they see your ship they will change color and fire.  They also have a bad tendency to ram your ship.
Jarra Spinners -- Jarra Spinners tend to move faster than Torkan Scout Ships, but they also move in a more straight forward pattern.   As the name implies they appear to be spinning as they move.
Mirrors (Bacura Shields) -- Mirrors are the single most annoying enemy in Xevious.  These large rotating squares appear in large swarms at various points in the game.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but they are INDESTRUCTABLE!  That's right, all you can do is avoid them and hope one doesn't go smashing into your cockpit.  Thankfully Mirror swarms are fairly uncommon.
Zoshi Death Squad -- These odd shaped UFO's are encountered in the later areas.  As the name suggests, Zoshi Death Squads are quick and deadly.  Take great care when attempting to engage themnnGiddo Spario -- These tiny balls of energy are quick and hard to see.  Unless you're careful these will wipe your ship out in no time.
Zakato Energy Launcher -- Zakato Energy Launchers (also known as Black Balls) are on of the deadliest enemies in Xevious.  Appearing out of nowhere, Black Balls self-destruct into a fast moving bullet which will then launch itself at you.  While one or two are easy to avoid, Black Balls like to swarm and appear right next to your ship making them all the more deadly.  Black Balls tend to herald the arrival of Andor Genesis, so when they start to appear you know Andor isn't far behind.
Andor Genesis -- This is the big one, the Mother Ship!  Andor Genesis is a hulking air fortress armed with four laser cannons just dying to blow you out of the sky.  The only way to defeat Andor Genesis is with a direct hit on the rector core with a photon bomb (think Star Wars), however getting close enough to Andor Genesis without being hit is a major challenge.  Destroying the rector will cause Andor Genesis will cause it to flee and prepare itself for another attack.
Domogram Rovers -- As the name implies Rovers spend their days roaming along the ground just taking pot shots at your ship.  Rovers move quite fast and can be difficult to bombnnLogram Sphere Station -- These sphere shaped structures appear to be harmless although they will occasionally shoot a bullet towards your ship.  Be on your guard.
Derota Defense Station -- These square pyramid shaped structures are the most common defensive structure that you'll encounter.  Derota Defense Stations will often shoot a quick moving energy bullet at your ship.  Take them out quickly before they become a problem.
Batra Energy Station -- These square pyramid shaped structures provide power for the Xevion assault fleet.  They'll take pot shots at you if you get too close.
When Ray Kassar was fired as CEO of Atari in 1983, James Morgan was hired to take his place.  Jim put all projects on hold for 30 days while he reviewed what had been going on during Ray's "reign of terror".  Since the 7800 was deemed high priority, most 2600 and 5200 projects were put on hold or outsourced to GCC.  It was originally assumed that Xevious was one of the 2600 titles that were killed off during this time, but recently a nearly complete version of the game was found proving that it survived at least until early 1984.
While the gameplay in the 2600 version is amazingly accurate, some corners still had to be cut.  One of the 2600's biggest problem was that it only had one fire button, making many arcade conversions difficult.  Tod got around this problem by having the fire button serve double duty as your fire and bomb button.  Pressing the fire will shoot a shot and drop a bomb that slowly arcs to where the targeting sight is.  The enemy AI also got a bit of a lobotomy so they all generally act the same instead of having distinct attack patterns.  Amazingly Tod was able to implement a scrolling background as was seen in the arcade version.  While this background wasn't as detailed as it's arcade cousin, it was still a major accomplishment for the 2600.  Not only was Tod able to get the scrolling background implemented, but he was able to have multiple enemies appear on the screen at once with little or no flicker.  In fact the only thing that flickers in the entire game is your ship which is actually made up of two missile graphics to keep more sprites free (hence the funny shape and flickering).  This odd design also makes your ship almost twice as large as it was in the arcade (making it harder to dodge enemy shots).
Although Xevious appears to be just about complete, there are a few bugs still present in the code.  The 2600 version of Xevious has an option for controlling the scrolling speed with the difficulty switches (a feature not found in any other version).  However when the game is put in fast mode (A=Slow, B=Fast) the scrolling gets rather choppy and non-uniform making it hard to play after a while.   There's also a glitch in one of the animation frames of the boss (Andor Genesis) due to the game accidentally reading sound code rather than graphics code.  Scoring seems to be a bit generous in this version making it easy to rack up extra lives, but it is unknown if this would have been changed before release.  The code is also unoptimized which wastes a lot of space that could have been used for other improvements, however since code optimization is one of the last things that is done to a game before completion this is not unexpected.
Unfortunately as good as Xevious was, it didn't stand a chance against the deadliest of enemies ?collapsing market'.   The 2600 version along with the 5200 version were canceled with the 7800 version being the only one to see the light of day.  This is a shame because it's obvious that Tod was a highly skilled programmer who could push the 2600 to its limits and Xevious is an amazing looking game.  The remaining bugs could have probably been squashed with just a few more weeks of work with code optimization taking a little longer.  Had it been finished Xevious probably would have been a mainstay in the 2600 library and a big hit, but it appears that Atari wasn't willing to wait.</desc>

		<desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>
