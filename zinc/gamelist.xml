		<name>Dancing Eyes (World, DC2/VER.B)</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 27 years ago:

Dancing Eyes (c) 1996 Namco.

A typically Japanese flavoured puzzle game in which the idea is to 'colour in' areas of women's clothing in order to strip them to their underwear. Gameplay is a variation on Konami's popular and much-copied 1981 classic, "Amidar". Once a level is completed, the player can watch their on-screen female counterpart 'dance', during which the player can use the joystick to move the in-game camera.

		<name>Dead Or Alive ++ (Japan/USA/Export)</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 25 years ago:

Dead or Alive ++ (c) 1998 Tecmo, Limited.

An update of the 1996 original, this game run on the ZN-1 architecture, hardware based the Sony Playstation.

Upon its initial release, the now-respected series drew attention and notoriety as much for the gravity-defying 'bouncing breasts' of its female protagonists as for its solid, inventive gameplay.

- TRIVIA -

Dead or Alive ++ was released on October 16, 1998.

Presented by Team Ninja (see 'Staff' section for more information).

This game runs on Sony Playstation-based hardware while the original Dead or Alive runs on the more powerful Sega Model 2 hardware. Consequently, this game uses 3-D arenas surrounded by 2D backdrops while the original Dead or Alive uses a fully 3-D environment rendered in real time. However, this game compensates with smoother, rounder character models and better lighting effects.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Raidou: complete a game playing as Kasumi in Tournament Mode and defeating Raidou at stage 8, then in the name entry screen input the word 'SIAWASE?'. Raidou appears now in the character select screen.

		<name>G-Darius (Ver 2.02O)</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 26 years ago:

G-Darius (c) 1997 Taito Corp.

G-Darius literally added a new dimension to the highly regarded 'Darius' series, with the introduction of fully 3D rendered backgrounds and enemies. Namco had already done the same with their Xevious series for "Xevious 3D/G", released the year earlier, but G-Darius is generally regarded as the most accomplished of the two titles.

G-Darius' game-play was also enhanced, with the 'Capture Ball' system; this allowed the player to capture almost any enemy craft and use it against the game's other enemies. Captured enemies can either be detonated like a ''bomb'', damaging all enemies nearby; or used to fire a special 'Alpha Beam', which cuts through everything but gold-colored objects and enemy bosses. Each boss is capable of firing its own version of this beam at the player; when both beams meet, they will interrupt each other's path. Depending on how rapidly the player presses the Fire button, one beam will grow and eventually overpower the others. The Capture ball was actually introduced in "Darius Gaiden" but was only used to a minimal extent.

		<name>Hyper Athlete (GV021 Japan 1.00)</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 27 years ago:

Hyper Athlete (c) 1996 Konami.

A superb 3-D update of Konami's Track and Field series, in which up to 4 players compete in 11 different Olympic events. All 6 events from the legendary first game, 1983's "Track and Field", are included; but tellingly, only 3 events (swimming, pole vault and triple jump) are taken from the less accomplished sequel, Hyper Sports. Hyper Athlete uses the three-button control system of its predecessors (two RUN buttons and one ACTION button per player) and the 11 disciplines can be attempted in any order. The available events are:
* 100M DASH - Use the RUN buttons to run as fast as possible.
* LONG JUMP - Run to the take-off board then press and hold the ACTION button until you achieve the desired angle of jump (45 is optimal).
* FREESTYLE SWIMMING - Another straightforward "sprint" event, the only difference being that as you approach the end of you first length of the pool, press the ACTION button to 'flip' your swimmer and begin the return length.
* 110M HURDLES - Run and time jumps over the hurdles. the optimum jumping point is around the halfway point between the hurdles.
* HAMMER THROW - Gradually build up the power meter, the athlete will do three build-up spins followed by three full-speed spins; on the third full spin, hold and release the ACTION button to achieve the desired angle of throw (45 is optimal).
* DISCUS - Similar to the Hammer Throw, only this time, instead of gradually charging up the power meter, try for full power from the start. You must release the discus on the second spin. Be aware that on this event, the angle meter increases much faster than in other events.
* SHOT PUT - Start charging up the power meter and your character will bow down and lift his leg. As he begins to turn, hold the ACTION and release once the desired angle is achieved (45 is optimal).
* HIGH JUMP - Run to the bar as quickly as possible. When you reach it, a "Jump" caption appears; immediately press ACTION button to start the jump. The longer the button is held down, the less steep the angle of your jump, i.e. just tapping the button would generate a jump of 90 degrees.
* JAVELIN - Run to the line as quickly as possible, then press and hold ACTION, releasing to chose the desired angle of throw (50 is optimal).
* TRIPLE JUMP - Press RUN (LEFT and RIGHT) buttons repeatedly to gain speed, then hold ACTION to initiate the first jump. It should be noted that for the first two jumps, the angle meter does not appear. The player should hold the button down for about .5 of a second before releasing. When you land you will take one step forward, press ACTION only when you have taken a step to instigate the second jump. The angle meter comes into play on the third and final jump, and the desired angle is 45 degrees.
* POLE VAULT - This is by far the trickiest event of the game. Press the RUN buttons to start the run-up. Then, as you near the silver pole trap, hold ACTION and the pole will lower towards the trap (the closer it is, the more power you will have for the next part). Keep holding ACTION until you reach the top of the bar, then release. You will then let go of the pole and vault over.

		<name>Psychic Force (Ver 2.4O)</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 27 years ago:

Psychic Force (c) 1996 Taito Corporation.

A great fighting game with eight selectable characters.

The plot takes place in the year 2010, where selected individuals are blessed with the power of psychic abilities. All people imbued with this power are called "Psychiccers" and uses a specific element such as fire, ice or gravity in fighting. 

Time after Psychiccers are shunned by normal people because of their unnatural abilities and that most cases turn violent and deadly. All of that changes one day when a mysterious corporation known as "NOA" appears and offers Psychiccers a place in their company. Headed by a man named Keith Evans, the corporation seeks to create a perfect utopia for Psychiccers and that they'll eliminate anyone who stands in their way. 

Challenging NOA's ambition is a small independent group known as "Anti-NOA" and that one of its members, a young American Psychiccer named Burn Griffiths, seeks to confront and stop his old friend Keith from going through with his extreme plans of creating a Psychiccer-only world.

		<name>Ray Storm (Ver 2.05J)</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 27 years ago:

レイストーム (c) 1996 Taito Corporation.
(Ray Storm)

3-D follow up to Rayforce featuring a lock-on laser system.

A sequel of RayForce that does not follow the main plot "Con-Human" storyline, to this time the plot consists of eight stages taking place between August 4 and August 7, 2219 AD; the first three stages take place on Earth, the last three at the fictional planet Secilia, and two between them in the orbits of Earth and Secilia, respectively. Whereas RayForce players must head toward Earth to destroy it, RayStorm players start at and move away from the planet. The plot of the game is exposed minimally during play, with only dates and place names given at the start of each of its first seven stages. An "Extra Mode" included with home versions of the game displays maps before the first seven stages and a closing crawl after completing the game, which further illustrate the plot; the map for the fifth stage, for example, shows that a "gravity catapult" at the Moon is used to travel from Earth orbit to Secilia orbit.

In a future where space travel has existed since 2119. Humans explored space, and within 100 years Earth established a twenty-colony Star Federation extending to Orion, with each colony kept under martial law. The colonies then mutinied against the Federation: they took control of the major colony Secilia, formed the Secilia Federation and defeated Earth's forces after many battles. After Earth's surrender, all of its inhabitants had been transferred to the colonies. The Secilia Federation suppressed colonial opposition and sent out a force to destroy the planet completely. However, by then the R-Gray, a aircraft made with parts salvaged from 13 different Secilia ships, is completed and deployed to carry out OPERATION RAYSTORM, a desperate attempt to defend Earth from the Federation.

		<name>Strider Hiryu 2 (Japan 991213)</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 24 years ago:

Strider Hiryu 2 (c) 1999 Capcom.

A direct sequel to the superb 1989 original, the player once again takes on the role of Strider Hiryu; a ninja who wields a deadly plasma-ejecting cypher called the 'Falchion'. Players start the game by selecting one of three difficult missions, with a fourth becoming available once the initial three are completed. Completing the fourth mission will unlock the final 'boss' mission, in which the player must battle a number of bosses which includes the rogue 'Strider Hien' from the first Strider game. Once all missions are completed, the character of Strider Hien - who wields two ranged cyphers - is unlocked.

To add variety to the tight gameplay, Capcom included special unlockable and powerful skills to aid players on their missions. These included the Savage Slash ('Midare-Giri' in Japanese), Hassou Jump, Boost (unlimited if missions defeated by Hien) and rapid slash.

Strider 2 features improved graphics - now rendered in pseudo 3-D - but with hack-and-slash gameplay largely unaltered from the first game. One difference to the original is a greater emphasis placed on boss encounters.

- TRIVIA -

Strider Hiryu 2 was originally released in December 1999 in Japan. The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Flying Dragon Strider 2'. 

This game is known outside Japan as "Strider 2".

This is not the first Strider sequel to be released. U.S. Gold published a game known as "Strider Returns" to various home consoles, such as the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, throughout the early 1990s. However, the game was poorly received by critics and gamers alike due to poor gameplay. Because of its failure and the true sequel being named Strider 2, it is possible that Capcom actually denied its existence.

The first background music from Stage 1 (Armed Fortress Invasion 1) samples 'Shot in the Dark', a song from Ozzy Osbourne.

Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Strider Hiryu 2 Original Soundtrack - CPCA-1035) on January 21, 2000.

- TRIVIA -

Tekken was released in December 1994 in the Arcades.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Iron Fist'.

The game was originally going to be called 'Rave War'.

The music in Tekken was recycled in "Tekken 2" for all except Venezia and the Character Select BGM. Marine Stadium -&gt; Bruce, Monument Valley -&gt; Armor King, Angkor Wat -&gt; Kunimitsu, Fiji -&gt; Roger, Windermere -&gt; P.Jack, Acropolis -&gt; Kuma, Chicago -&gt; Lee, Szechwan -&gt; Wang, Kyoto -&gt; Ganryu, King George Island -&gt; Anna.

Some of the characters' sound effects are recycled for other characters:
Kazuya and Lee
Yoshimitsu and Kunimitsu
Nina and Anna
Jack, P.Jack, Ganryu and Heihachi
King, Armor King and Kuma
Law, Paul, Michelle and Wang have their own individual sounds.

Interestingly, Kunimitsu had Yoshimitsu's voice, although Kunimitsu is a female character. Why Namco decided not to use Michelle's or Nina's voices no-one knows.

Law was originally going to be called 'Dragon'. This name remained on his PL1 outfit. In the sound ROM, the announcer says 'Law the Dragon', but this was cut to just say 'Law' afterwards. This is why the announcer's voice sounds cut off mid-sentence.

The boss characters mostly share the same moves as the 8 playable characters, with more moves added (e.g. Heihachi gains the 'Hammer to Power Punch' from Paul). While the boss characters share the same moves as the regular characters, they are also given extra moves for extra difficulty.
Similarity of the boss characters:
Heihachi: Kazuya
P.Jack: Jack
Ganryu: Jack
Kuma: Jack
Lee: Law
Anna: Nina
Wang: Michelle
Armor King: King
Kunimitsu: Yoshimitsu

Paul was never 'cloned' by any character.

Heihachi was given Paul's 'Hammer to Power Punch' &amp; 'Heavy Power Punch' (a.k.a. Deathfist, a fan name).
P.Jack was given Paul's 'Hammer to Power Punch'.
Kuma was given Michelle's 'G-Clef Cannon'.
Wang was given Paul's 'Heavy Power Punch'.
Armor King was given Kazuya's 'Rising Uppercut' &amp; 'Dragon Uppercut'.
Anna was given Law's 'Crescent Kick'.
Lee was given Paul's 'Double Hop Kick' combos and Kazuya's 'Left Splits Kick'.
Ganryu received the only hidden (non-playable) moves of the game - left and right handed versions of the 'Palm Combo'. Players would find this move later in "Tekken 2".
Kunimitsu remained unchanged and shared every Yoshimitsu move (however the CPU never used the sword moves or the 10-hit combo against a player).

2ND (Kazuya) 51'00"00 GNY

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* If you attempt to throw an opponent but it doesn't connect properly, the opponent will yell in a hurt manner. This can be done if you're slightly out of range (only just connect but miss), if the opponent is in the air, and also if they have their back turned. It's funny when you perform this against Yoshimitsu, as he will say 'Ow!' even though he wasn't hurt in any way!

* The slowest recovering move in the game is Jack's 'Body Press'. If Jack doesn't fully connect with the opponent, he will fall over and automatically stagger backwards, leaving himself open to lots of attacks. On the other side, if you happen to be crushed by Jack, you will be stuck on the ground for an even longer time.

* The most powerful move in the game is Jack's 'Gigaton Punch', at 128 damage points and an instant KO. The player must wind up by rotating the stick 5 times, with the announcer counting, and press Left Punch to complete the move. Failure to do so will leave Jack winding his arm for a short while and you can't move or block until he powers back down. Left Punch can be pushed during any wind-up but will do less damage the shorter the wind-up is.

* Nina has a special throw called the 'Back Hand Slap'. This unique throw can be linked to more damaging moves, in the form of an unblockable combo. Anna (CPU) has a toned down version of the same move with only one follow-up (Arm Snap).
- Back Hand Slap: In a quarter circle motion roll the stick D,DF,F and press LP+RP to initiate the throw. This throw is not very damaging and is the only throw to leave the opponent still standing. On its own it does 15 damage.
- Arm Break: Right after grabbing the opponent with the above move, quickly press LP,LK,RP,LP. Nina will grab her opponent's arm and bend it backwards. 20 damage (total 35).
- Double Arm Break: If you thought breaking one arm was enough, the 'Silent Assassin'  will turn around again and break both her opponents arms at the same time. This is done right after the animation changes to 'Arm Break' by pressing LK,LP,RK,LP+RP,LP+RP in the short amount of time. 25 damage (total 60).
- Falling Arm Break: An alternative combo to the Arm Break. Nina will instead fall on top of her opponent's broken arm causing more damage. This is done right after the animation changes to 'Arm Break' by pressing RP,LP,LK,RK,LP+RP in the short amount of time. 25 damage (total 60).
- Arm Snap: Another Back Hand Slap follow-up. Right after grabbing the opponent with the first move, quickly press LK,RK,LK,LP+RP. Nina will wrestle her opponent to the ground and break their arm. 30 damage (total 45).

* Michelle is the only character in Tekken to have a back throw; a special throw which would be available to all characters as of "Tekken 2" and later. Wang (CPU character on stage 8) also has this throw. If you are caught in this move, hold Down to duck the throw.

Spin Behind to Behind Back Suplex: Press Back+RP (spin on hit), then hold LP+RP to initiate back throw. 12+45 damage (total 57).

* Some moves are not blockable if done in sequence: King's 'Exploder' and 'Running Exploder' can be followed up to a rising kick, as can Nina's 'Forward Flip Kick'. The rolling cross chop (all character except Jack) from the ground also has a similar property if a simple left or right punch is made. You can do basic juggle moves (air combos) from this feature.

* 10-Hit Combos (buttons: LP=1, RP=2, LK=3, RK=4): These must be timed so each move corresponds with each hit (or, take advantage of the 'feature' which lets all buttons pressed at once count as each hit after the first). This was fixed in the PlayStation version and later games.

* CONSOLES:
Sony PlayStation (1995): On this version, the Marine Stadium stage was renamed to just Stadium. The AI is also much easier. On the Stadium stage, a big screen reflects you fighting, just like the mirror on the Tekken 2 Devil stage. The music is remixed by default, including the Kazuya intro, but has the option of selecting the original arcade music, however there's no 'arcade' Kazuya intro music. The eight boss characters, as well as Heihachi, can also be unlocked on this game, and have some updated moves from Tekken 2 thrown in. Jack's 'raaah' sound (heard during Lift Up throw) is missing, however P.Jack has it, but P.Jack's 'mreeyah' sound has been replaced by it.
Sony PlayStation 2 (2005, "Tekken 5 Ultimate Collectors Edition")
Sony PlayStation 2 (2005, "NamCollection"): Japan release only.
Sony PlayStation 2 (2005, "Tekken 5"): Available in the Arcade History mode. This game is an updated version of the actual arcade version, with fewer options and no coin settings. The Marine Stadium stage has been renamed to Stadium again. The characters have the arcade AI, but are given sampled sound effects like the PlayStation version.

Tekken 2 (c) 1995 Namco.

Two years after winning the original 'King of the Iron Fist' tournament, Kazuya Mishima decides to hold a second tournament in an attempt to finish off his father, Heihachi Mishima, in this sequel to 1994 original.

The gameplay in Tekken 2 is identical to that of its predecessor, with one or two players fighting over a series of 3D-rendered backdrops. As before, the fighting system utilises four attack buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick and right kick. Certain button combinations will initiate both standard and special grab and throwing moves.

- TRIVIA -

Released in August 1995.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Iron Fist 2'.

Angel is still called Devil until the Sony PlayStation release.

Jun Kazama and Kazuya Mishima aren't connected by any other way other than the fact that Kazuya is the son of Heihachi, who is the owner of the Mishima Zaibatsu and Jun is a worker at a world wildlife NGO. During the Tekken 2 Tournament, Jun Kazama and Kazuya Mishima marry (Namco never elaborated on the nature of their relationship, seeing as how they faced each other in Tekken 2 as opponents). After their marriage, Kazuya is killed by his own father who was jealous of him because Kazuya had the 'devil' inside him which Heihachi has been trying to capture for a long time. Jin is a born after a little time. He is trained by Heihachi... during this Jin's mother is killed by the God of fight (Toshin) or originally 'Ogre' (Ogre appears in the next sequel, "Tekken 3"). Jin keeps practicing until he is 18 and he then participates in Tekken3 to take the revenge of his mother and fathers death. The story continues...

NEC Avenue released 2 limited-edition soundtrack albums for this game (Tekken 2 Strike Fighting Vol.1 - NACL-1225 &amp; Tekken 2 Strike Fighting Vol.2 - NACL-1229) respectively on 29/06/1996 and 20/07/1996.

Michael Jackson used to own this game (Serial number M450). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on Apr. 24th, 2009.

- UPDATES -

REVISION 1:
* Software version: TES2/VER.A
* Build date: 19:01:47, AUG 3 1995
* Green text for timer, round, insert coin etc.
* Most throws do not have the opponent yell in pain when thrown (like "Tekken").

REVISION 2:
* Software versions: TES2/VER.B, TES3/VER.B
* Build date: 10:39:16, SEP 29 1995
* Yellow text for timer, round, insert coin etc.
* AI is modified, opponents' sound effects were added to almost all throws.
* Added some new moves, listed below.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Basic throws can be escaped by pressing the same buttons as the corresponding throw. A LP+LK throw is escaped by pressing LP+LK, and a RP+RK throw is escaped by pressing RP+RK.

* Special throws, as well as back throws, cannot be escaped - use these when in close quarters, but don't abuse them or people (and the CPU) will start ducking under them.

* Ultimate Tackle (Paul, Kazuya) can be escaped with RP+RK. The running tackle cannot be escaped however.

* Some chain throws (Nina, King, Anna, Bruce) can be escaped using certain combinations of LP+RP, LP+LK, LK+RK or RP+RK.

* Non-grab throws also cannot be escaped:
Body Press (Jack-2, P.Jack, Kuma)
Frankensteiner (King, Armor King, Roger/Alex)
Run Up To Drop (Law)
Whirlwind Toss (Wang)
Slow Power Punch Combo (Michelle, Wang)
Machine Gun Cannon (Michelle)
Running Tackle (all)
Attack Reversal (Nina, Paul, Jun, Wang, Anna) - 'Chicken' move was added in Tekken 3 to counter throw

* If Devil or Angel fly in the air to fire their laser (the move being called Devil Blaster aka Flying Killer Beam) and you are close to them, run under them, turn around and perform a back throw when they land. If you are too far away to do this, dash back and hold the stick U/B to perform a large backward jump to clear the laser. Note that timing the jump is important otherwise your character will still be hit by the laser. Note that larger characters like Jack-2 and Kuma will have more difficulty clearing the laser. If the laser is still unavoidable, jumping into the laser without attacking deals less damage than being hit while standing still and will allow you to recover much faster.
* If Devil or Angel perform their Devil Blaster while you are on the ground, press LP to roll to the side just before the laser reaches the ground, this will make you roll out of the way of the laser and you can then retaliate. Note that this can only be done if your character is lying on their back. Some characters such as Kazuya may also be able to sidestep the laser but this is usually more difficult.

* Tekken 2 also has a few bugs in its moves database:
Hammer Punch (Paul, Heihachi, P.Jack). Can be done facing backwards. You can also continue to the Power Punch by following with RP.
Geta Stomping (Heihachi). Can be done facing backwards, opponent must be on ground.
Sledge Hammer (Bruce). Can be done facing backwards.
Face Crushing Knee (Bruce). On Ver.A machines this causes a sound bug against the opponent, who will use another character's voice half way through.
Inferno/Devil Blaster aka Killer Beam (Devil/Angel). Can be done facing backwards (both standing and flying versions).
Special throws (all). Throws like King's Tombstone Pile Driver can be performed backwards by reversing the directional input as though you're facing the opponent, causing the character to grab in the wrong direction.
Dragon Uppercut to Twin Pistons (Kazuya). On Ver.A machines, a Dragon Uppercut can be canceled into a rising Twin Pistons by inputting RP before the uppercut connects. This move is not actually a bug, as it actually has its own animation data specifically for this, however in Ver.B and later games the move and its extra animation was removed.

* Play As Hidden Characters (even if they aren't selectable yet):
Wang: On the character select screen, highlight Jun/Baek (whoever's default), then press Start, Down, Right, Left, Up
Anna: Highlight Nina, press Left, hold Start, press Right, Left(x2)
Baek (or Jun, if Baek is default): Highlight Law, press Start, Down, Start(x2), Down, Up
Lee: Highlight Heihachi, press Down, Start, Left, Start, hold Left and press Start
Kazuya: Highlight Heihachi, press Down, Up, hold Up, press Start(x2), release Up, press Up again
P.Jack: Highlight Jack-2, press Down(x2), hold Start and press Up(x2)
Armor King: Highlight King, press Left, hold Start, press Left, Right, release Start, press Right
Ganryu: Highlight Michelle, hold Start, press Down, Up
Bruce: Highlight Lei, press Start(x4) and then Right

For the following characters you have to hold an attack button before entering the character select...
Kunimitsu: Hold LP, then press Start to enter character select, highlight Yoshimitsu, then press Right, Start
Kuma: Hold RP, press Start, highlight Paul, press Down, Start, Down
Alex: Hold RK, press Start, Up(x2)
Roger: Hold LK, press Start, Up(x2)

* Fight Roger or Alex on Stage 4: On the second/final round of Stage 3, defeat the opponent with less than 5% health (so the announcer says 'Great!'). Roger will appear if your character was selected with a punch button, Alex if selected with a kick button.

* Fight Kuma on Stage 4: If you have Roger or Alex and do the same thing Kuma will appear instead.

* Each character has a sub-boss (stage 8) depending on who started the game:
If Jun (default) was chosen, Wang will be on stage 8. Baek is in place of Jun if the "New Character" setting is set to 'Baek &amp; Lei'.
If Yoshimitsu was chosen, Kunimitsu will be on stage 8.
Nina: Anna.
Law: Baek or Jun depending on the "New Character" setting.
Heihachi: Lee.
Paul: Kuma.
Jack-2: P.Jack.
King: Armor King.
Michelle: Ganryu.
Lei: Bruce.
Roger: Alex.
Kazuya: Roger, Heihachi on stage 9 (never Alex on stage 8).
Devil: Heihachi, Jun on stage 9.
If a sub-boss is selected the characters are reversed e.g. selecting Armor King will make King appear.

* Tekken 2 Ver.B introduced some new moves into the game:
Wang: Whirlwind Toss (throw) - d/f+LP+LK+RK
Wang: Dragon Power Punch - b+LP+RP
Armor King: Jump to Capital Punishment - u (or u/f), LP+RP
Armor King: Jump to Burning Double Knuckle - u (or u/f), LP+RP,d (hold)
Armor King: Jump to Moonsault Body Press - u (or u/f), LP+RK
Lee: Silver Cyclone - (while crouching) d+LK+RK
Lee: Blazing Kick - d,d/b+RK (launches opponent on counter hit)
Ganryu: Sumo Popup - b,d/b,d,d/f+1
Ganryu: Take Down - (while fully crouched) d+LP+RP
Kuma: Salmon Hunting - b,f+RP+LK
Kuma: Grizzly Claw - b+LP+RP
Kuma: Rolling Bear - b+LP+RP, clockwise 360 x2
King: 10-Hit Combo ender - Combos ending in LK can now end in LP for an elbow drop; combo ending with Power Bomb can also end with LP or LK

* Some original moves were modified in Tekken 2 Ver.B:
Kazuya: Rising Sun combo was given an extra low sweep and named Roundhouse to Triple Spin Kick - u/f+RK,RK,RK,RK
Ganryu: Thunder Slap move notation was changed - Ver.A is d,d/f+RP, Ver.B is d/f+RP+LK

* One move was completely missing from the arcade versions but exists in the PlayStation home port:
Kuma: Head Butt - RP+RK,B

Attack Reversal (Nina, Paul, Jun, Wang, Anna) - 'Chicken' move was added in Tekken 3 to counter throw

* If Devil or Angel fly in the air to fire their laser (the move being called Devil Blaster aka Flying Killer Beam) and you are close to them, run under them, turn around and perform a back throw when they land. If you are too far away to do this, dash back and hold the stick U/B to perform a large backward jump to clear the laser. Note that timing the jump is important otherwise your character will still be hit by the laser. Note that larger characters like Jack-2 and Kuma will have more difficulty clearing the laser. If the laser is still unavoidable, jumping into the laser without attacking deals less damage than being hit while standing still and will allow you to recover much faster.
* If Devil or Angel perform their Devil Blaster while you are on the ground, press LP to roll to the side just before the laser reaches the ground, this will make you roll out of the way of the laser and you can then retaliate. Note that this can only be done if your character is lying on their back. Some characters such as Kazuya may also be able to sidestep the laser but this is usually more difficult.

* Tekken 2 also has a few bugs in its moves database:
Hammer Punch (Paul, Heihachi, P.Jack). Can be done facing backwards. You can also continue to the Power Punch by following with RP.
Geta Stomping (Heihachi). Can be done facing backwards, opponent must be on ground.
Sledge Hammer (Bruce). Can be done facing backwards.
Face Crushing Knee (Bruce). On Ver.A machines this causes a sound bug against the opponent, who will use another character's voice half way through.
Inferno/Devil Blaster aka Killer Beam (Devil/Angel). Can be done facing backwards (both standing and flying versions).
Special throws (all). Throws like King's Tombstone Pile Driver can be performed backwards by reversing the directional input as though you're facing the opponent, causing the character to grab in the wrong direction.
Dragon Uppercut to Twin Pistons (Kazuya). On Ver.A machines, a Dragon Uppercut can be canceled into a rising Twin Pistons by inputting RP before the uppercut connects. This move is not actually a bug, as it actually has its own animation data specifically for this, however in Ver.B and later games the move and its extra animation was removed.

* Play As Hidden Characters (even if they aren't selectable yet):
Wang: On the character select screen, highlight Jun/Baek (whoever's default), then press Start, Down, Right, Left, Up
Anna: Highlight Nina, press Left, hold Start, press Right, Left(x2)
Baek (or Jun, if Baek is default): Highlight Law, press Start, Down, Start(x2), Down, Up
Lee: Highlight Heihachi, press Down, Start, Left, Start, hold Left and press Start
Kazuya: Highlight Heihachi, press Down, Up, hold Up, press Start(x2), release Up, press Up again
P.Jack: Highlight Jack-2, press Down(x2), hold Start and press Up(x2)
Armor King: Highlight King, press Left, hold Start, press Left, Right, release Start, press Right
Ganryu: Highlight Michelle, hold Start, press Down, Up
Bruce: Highlight Lei, press Start(x4) and then Right

For the following characters you have to hold an attack button before entering the character select...
Kunimitsu: Hold LP, then press Start to enter character select, highlight Yoshimitsu, then press Right, Start
Kuma: Hold RP, press Start, highlight Paul, press Down, Start, Down
Alex: Hold RK, press Start, Up(x2)
Roger: Hold LK, press Start, Up(x2)

* Fight Roger or Alex on Stage 4: On the second/final round of Stage 3, defeat the opponent with less than 5% health (so the announcer says 'Great!'). Roger will appear if your character was selected with a punch button, Alex if selected with a kick button.

* Fight Kuma on Stage 4: If you have Roger or Alex and do the same thing Kuma will appear instead.

* Each character has a sub-boss (stage 8) depending on who started the game:
If Jun (default) was chosen, Wang will be on stage 8. Baek is in place of Jun if the "New Character" setting is set to 'Baek &amp; Lei'.
If Yoshimitsu was chosen, Kunimitsu will be on stage 8.
Nina: Anna.
Law: Baek or Jun depending on the "New Character" setting.
Heihachi: Lee.
Paul: Kuma.
Jack-2: P.Jack.
King: Armor King.
Michelle: Ganryu.
Lei: Bruce.
Roger: Alex.
Kazuya: Roger, Heihachi on stage 9 (never Alex on stage 8).
Devil: Heihachi, Jun on stage 9.
If a sub-boss is selected the characters are reversed e.g. selecting Armor King will make King appear.

* Tekken 2 Ver.B introduced some new moves into the game:
Wang: Whirlwind Toss (throw) - d/f+LP+LK+RK
Wang: Dragon Power Punch - b+LP+RP
Armor King: Jump to Capital Punishment - u (or u/f), LP+RP
Armor King: Jump to Burning Double Knuckle - u (or u/f), LP+RP,d (hold)
Armor King: Jump to Moonsault Body Press - u (or u/f), LP+RK
Lee: Silver Cyclone - (while crouching) d+LK+RK
Lee: Blazing Kick - d,d/b+RK (launches opponent on counter hit)
Ganryu: Sumo Popup - b,d/b,d,d/f+1
Ganryu: Take Down - (while fully crouched) d+LP+RP
Kuma: Salmon Hunting - b,f+RP+LK
Kuma: Grizzly Claw - b+LP+RP
Kuma: Rolling Bear - b+LP+RP, clockwise 360 x2
King: 10-Hit Combo ender - Combos ending in LK can now end in LP for an elbow drop; combo ending with Power Bomb can also end with LP or LK

* Some original moves were modified in Tekken 2 Ver.B:
Kazuya: Rising Sun combo was given an extra low sweep and named Roundhouse to Triple Spin Kick - u/f+RK,RK,RK,RK
Ganryu: Thunder Slap move notation was changed - Ver.A is d,d/f+RP, Ver.B is d/f+RP+LK

* One move was completely missing from the arcade versions but exists in the PlayStation home port:
Kuma: Head Butt - RP+RK,B

Tekken 2 (c) 1995 Namco.

Two years after winning the original 'King of the Iron Fist' tournament, Kazuya Mishima decides to hold a second tournament in an attempt to finish off his father, Heihachi Mishima, in this sequel to 1994 original.

The gameplay in Tekken 2 is identical to that of its predecessor, with one or two players fighting over a series of 3D-rendered backdrops. As before, the fighting system utilises four attack buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick and right kick. Certain button combinations will initiate both standard and special grab and throwing moves.

- TRIVIA -

Released in August 1995.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Iron Fist 2'.

Angel is still called Devil until the Sony PlayStation release.

Jun Kazama and Kazuya Mishima aren't connected by any other way other than the fact that Kazuya is the son of Heihachi, who is the owner of the Mishima Zaibatsu and Jun is a worker at a world wildlife NGO. During the Tekken 2 Tournament, Jun Kazama and Kazuya Mishima marry (Namco never elaborated on the nature of their relationship, seeing as how they faced each other in Tekken 2 as opponents). After their marriage, Kazuya is killed by his own father who was jealous of him because Kazuya had the 'devil' inside him which Heihachi has been trying to capture for a long time. Jin is a born after a little time. He is trained by Heihachi... during this Jin's mother is killed by the God of fight (Toshin) or originally 'Ogre' (Ogre appears in the next sequel, "Tekken 3"). Jin keeps practicing until he is 18 and he then participates in Tekken3 to take the revenge of his mother and fathers death. The story continues...

NEC Avenue released 2 limited-edition soundtrack albums for this game (Tekken 2 Strike Fighting Vol.1 - NACL-1225 &amp; Tekken 2 Strike Fighting Vol.2 - NACL-1229) respectively on 29/06/1996 and 20/07/1996.

Michael Jackson used to own this game (Serial number M450). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on Apr. 24th, 2009.

- UPDATES -

REVISION 1:
* Software version: TES2/VER.A
* Build date: 19:01:47, AUG 3 1995
* Green text for timer, round, insert coin etc.
* Most throws do not have the opponent yell in pain when thrown (like "Tekken").

REVISION 2:
* Software versions: TES2/VER.B, TES3/VER.B
* Build date: 10:39:16, SEP 29 1995
* Yellow text for timer, round, insert coin etc.
* AI is modified, opponents' sound effects were added to almost all throws.
* Added some new moves, listed below.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Basic throws can be escaped by pressing the same buttons as the corresponding throw. A LP+LK throw is escaped by pressing LP+LK, and a RP+RK throw is escaped by pressing RP+RK.

* Special throws, as well as back throws, cannot be escaped - use these when in close quarters, but don't abuse them or people (and the CPU) will start ducking under them.

* Ultimate Tackle (Paul, Kazuya) can be escaped with RP+RK. The running tackle cannot be escaped however.

* Some chain throws (Nina, King, Anna, Bruce) can be escaped using certain combinations of LP+RP, LP+LK, LK+RK or RP+RK.

* Non-grab throws also cannot be escaped:
Body Press (Jack-2, P.Jack, Kuma)
Frankensteiner (King, Armor King, Roger/Alex)
Run Up To Drop (Law)
Whirlwind Toss (Wang)
Slow Power Punch Combo (Michelle, Wang)
Machine Gun Cannon (Michelle)

Tekken 3 (c) 1997 Namco.

The world's 19 toughest fighters enter The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, in order to defeat Heihachi, and Ogre, who has taken the souls of many of the world's greatest fighters to adopt its own fighting style. Every character has his own ambition of winning the tournament. A fully 3-D game with one on one concept of fighting.

- TRIVIA -

Tekken 3 was released in March 1997 (even if the title screen says 1996).

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Iron Fist 3'.

This is the first Tekken game which has 3-D backgrounds. Namco's Tekken 3 production team used one of the most advanced motion capture apparatus and facilities at its time for the highly life-like movements, moves, actions and reactions of the 3-D characters. They also used some of the very famous and active personalities of different martial arts styles from all over the world, like, for Eddy Gordo's Capoeira style of fight they got the services of Master Marcelo Pereira of 'Capoeira Mandinga'. And for Hwoarang's Taekwondo style of fight they got the services of Hwang Su-Il of 'Japan International Taekon-do Federation, and several other martial arts institutes.

Namco's production team motion captured each and every move to create such an in depth game, that was also one of the most higly anticipated fighting game for the last few years. After Tekken 3, its followers like Tekken Tag, Tekken 4 and Tekken 5 got more and more depth, life-like impression, and the element of giving more fun (and addictiveness to its players).

The word Tournament on the 'You are the Champion!' background is mis-spelled in the Japanese version as 'Tounament'.

Most of the characters like Jin, Law, Julia are the children of the characters from the first Tekken games.

The Lei Wulong music theme was certainly inspired by East 17's song: Steam (1994).

In the Sound FX there is the announcer voice for Jun Kazama, Kazuya Mishima and Sake meaning these characters could have been in the game but weren't added to the final version.

There are 21 different characters, but Anna, Tiger and Panda play identical to Nina, Eddy and Kuma respectively. In total, excluding Anna, Tiger, Panda and Mokujin, there are 17 characters with different moves.

With a cheat enabled sometimes you can face Jun and a new character, Sake (pronounced Shaa-Ke). In fact Jun has a graphic for the VS. screen and a name tag for the energy bar. Uses Nina's body and Jin's moves Sake only has a name tag. Uses Yoshimitsu's body and Jin's moves, and a blank VS. picture. You can play with them with the code enabled. You'll have to find the value which the cpu uses to select your character. The value for Jun is 17 in Hex that will be (11). After you've played with Jun or Sake in the game you can see Jun and Sake in the Percentage Screens which appear in the game randomly when nobody is playing. Jun has got her Percentage Page's thumbnail but sake uses Paul's thumbnail. In the same way, after you've played with Jun and/or Sake you can see them in the EDS screen from the Dip-Switch menu. It looks like Namco was putting Jun and Sake but then stopped working on them for some purposes (explained below):
1) According to the story Jun gets killed by Ogre (the god of fight). So if they would've put her they couldn't put Jin in the game as he probably looks of the same age of his mother. That doesn't apply to TekkenTag which has both Jin and his mother Jun, because TekkenTag does not have any storyline and the idea is to put all the characters from previous games (some of them were even dead).
2) Sake was rather populating the game as the game had already got 20 characters at that time. Namco's production team probably didn't had much time to re-do the whole code for character selection so they buried the two raw characters in an as-is condition forever...

A cameo of this game seen is in the 2000 movie 'Dude, Where's My Car?'. A "Tekken 3" cabinet can be briefly shown in the arcade scene.

Wonder Spirits released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Tekken 3 arcade soundtrack 001 ex - WSCAX-10001) on 18/07/1997.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When a Time Release character is about to become selectable the vs. screen before a demo fight will say "Coming Soon" and display a picture of the hidden character.

* Play as Anna Williams: Highlight Nina on the character selection screen and press Start. Anna plays identical to Nina. Anna is only available after Bryan is unlocked from Time Release.

* Play as Tiger: Highlight Eddy at the character selection screen and press the Start button. Tiger plays identical to Eddy. This option is only available after Ogre 2 (aka True Ogre) is unlocked from Time Release.

* Special Outfits: There are three characters that can have an additional outfit by pressing Start to select them instead of a punch or kick button, these are: Jin, Law and Xiaoyu. Law's third outfit is selectable from the start but Jin and Xiaoyu's school outfits can only be selected after Mokujin is unlocked from Time Release.

* Fight Jin on Stage 9: If you start a game with Heihachi you will fight Jin on Stage 9 instead, regardless if you continue and choose another character.

note: On the home version, Anna was redone as a separate character with different moves, which a few were recycled from Tekken 1 and 2 to differentiate from Nina. One such move is the 'Red Bomb', denoted f,f+1+2; the animation for the falling opponent is from Tekken 1.

The transformed main boss, known more commonly as 'Ogre 2' (named simply as Ogre in the game itself), was renamed True Ogre in the PlayStation release.

- TRIVIA -

Tekken was released in December 1994 in the Arcades.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Iron Fist'.

The game was originally going to be called 'Rave War'.

The music in Tekken was recycled in "Tekken 2" for all except Venezia and the Character Select BGM. Marine Stadium -&gt; Bruce, Monument Valley -&gt; Armor King, Angkor Wat -&gt; Kunimitsu, Fiji -&gt; Roger, Windermere -&gt; P.Jack, Acropolis -&gt; Kuma, Chicago -&gt; Lee, Szechwan -&gt; Wang, Kyoto -&gt; Ganryu, King George Island -&gt; Anna.

Some of the characters' sound effects are recycled for other characters:
Kazuya and Lee
Yoshimitsu and Kunimitsu
Nina and Anna
Jack, P.Jack, Ganryu and Heihachi
King, Armor King and Kuma
Law, Paul, Michelle and Wang have their own individual sounds.

Interestingly, Kunimitsu had Yoshimitsu's voice, although Kunimitsu is a female character. Why Namco decided not to use Michelle's or Nina's voices no-one knows.

Law was originally going to be called 'Dragon'. This name remained on his PL1 outfit. In the sound ROM, the announcer says 'Law the Dragon', but this was cut to just say 'Law' afterwards. This is why the announcer's voice sounds cut off mid-sentence.

The boss characters mostly share the same moves as the 8 playable characters, with more moves added (e.g. Heihachi gains the 'Hammer to Power Punch' from Paul). While the boss characters share the same moves as the regular characters, they are also given extra moves for extra difficulty.
Similarity of the boss characters:
Heihachi: Kazuya
P.Jack: Jack
Ganryu: Jack
Kuma: Jack
Lee: Law
Anna: Nina
Wang: Michelle
Armor King: King
Kunimitsu: Yoshimitsu

Paul was never 'cloned' by any character.

Heihachi was given Paul's 'Hammer to Power Punch' &amp; 'Heavy Power Punch' (a.k.a. Deathfist, a fan name).
P.Jack was given Paul's 'Hammer to Power Punch'.
Kuma was given Michelle's 'G-Clef Cannon'.
Wang was given Paul's 'Heavy Power Punch'.
Armor King was given Kazuya's 'Rising Uppercut' &amp; 'Dragon Uppercut'.
Anna was given Law's 'Crescent Kick'.
Lee was given Paul's 'Double Hop Kick' combos and Kazuya's 'Left Splits Kick'.
Ganryu received the only hidden (non-playable) moves of the game - left and right handed versions of the 'Palm Combo'. Players would find this move later in "Tekken 2".
Kunimitsu remained unchanged and shared every Yoshimitsu move (however the CPU never used the sword moves or the 10-hit combo against a player).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* If you attempt to throw an opponent but it doesn't connect properly, the opponent will yell in a hurt manner. This can be done if you're slightly out of range (only just connect but miss), if the opponent is in the air, and also if they have their back turned. It's funny when you perform this against Yoshimitsu, as he will say 'Ow!' even though he wasn't hurt in any way!

* The slowest recovering move in the game is Jack's 'Body Press'. If Jack doesn't fully connect with the opponent, he will fall over and automatically stagger backwards, leaving himself open to lots of attacks. On the other side, if you happen to be crushed by Jack, you will be stuck on the ground for an even longer time.

* The most powerful move in the game is Jack's 'Gigaton Punch', at 128 damage points and an instant KO. The player must wind up by rotating the stick 5 times, with the announcer counting, and press Left Punch to complete the move. Failure to do so will leave Jack winding his arm for a short while and you can't move or block until he powers back down. Left Punch can be pushed during any wind-up but will do less damage the shorter the wind-up is.

* Nina has a special throw called the 'Back Hand Slap'. This unique throw can be linked to more damaging moves, in the form of an unblockable combo. Anna (CPU) has a toned down version of the same move with only one follow-up (Arm Snap).
- Back Hand Slap: In a quarter circle motion roll the stick D,DF,F and press LP+RP to initiate the throw. This throw is not very damaging and is the only throw to leave the opponent still standing. On its own it does 15 damage.
- Arm Break: Right after grabbing the opponent with the above move, quickly press LP,LK,RP,LP. Nina will grab her opponent's arm and bend it backwards. 20 damage (total 35).
- Double Arm Break: If you thought breaking one arm was enough, the 'Silent Assassin'  will turn around again and break both her opponents arms at the same time. This is done right after the animation changes to 'Arm Break' by pressing LK,LP,RK,LP+RP,LP+RP in the short amount of time. 25 damage (total 60).
- Falling Arm Break: An alternative combo to the Arm Break. Nina will instead fall on top of her opponent's broken arm causing more damage. This is done right after the animation changes to 'Arm Break' by pressing RP,LP,LK,RK,LP+RP in the short amount of time. 25 damage (total 60).
- Arm Snap: Another Back Hand Slap follow-up. Right after grabbing the opponent with the first move, quickly press LK,RK,LK,LP+RP. Nina will wrestle her opponent to the ground and break their arm. 30 damage (total 45).

* Michelle is the only character in Tekken to have a back throw; a special throw which would be available to all characters as of "Tekken 2" and later. Wang (CPU character on stage 8) also has this throw. If you are caught in this move, hold Down to duck the throw.

Spin Behind to Behind Back Suplex: Press Back+RP (spin on hit), then hold LP+RP to initiate back throw. 12+45 damage (total 57).

* Some moves are not blockable if done in sequence: King's 'Exploder' and 'Running Exploder' can be followed up to a rising kick, as can Nina's 'Forward Flip Kick'. The rolling cross chop (all character except Jack) from the ground also has a similar property if a simple left or right punch is made. You can do basic juggle moves (air combos) from this feature.

* 10-Hit Combos (buttons: LP=1, RP=2, LK=3, RK=4): These must be timed so each move corresponds with each hit (or, take advantage of the 'feature' which lets all buttons pressed at once count as each hit after the first). This was fixed in the PlayStation version and later games.

* CONSOLES:
Sony PlayStation (1995): On this version, the Marine Stadium stage was renamed to just Stadium. The AI is also much easier. On the Stadium stage, a big screen reflects you fighting, just like the mirror on the Tekken 2 Devil stage. The music is remixed by default, including the Kazuya intro, but has the option of selecting the original arcade music, however there's no 'arcade' Kazuya intro music. The eight boss characters, as well as Heihachi, can also be unlocked on this game, and have some updated moves from Tekken 2 thrown in. Jack's 'raaah' sound (heard during Lift Up throw) is missing, however P.Jack has it, but P.Jack's 'mreeyah' sound has been replaced by it.
Sony PlayStation 2 (2005, "Tekken 5 Ultimate Collectors Edition")
Sony PlayStation 2 (2005, "NamCollection"): Japan release only.
Sony PlayStation 2 (2005, "Tekken 5"): Available in the Arcade History mode. This game is an updated version of the actual arcade version, with fewer options and no coin settings. The Marine Stadium stage has been renamed to Stadium again. The characters have the arcade AI, but are given sampled sound effects like the PlayStation version.

* Nina has a special throw called the 'Back Hand Slap'. This unique throw can be linked to more damaging moves, in the form of an unblockable combo. Anna (CPU) has a toned down version of the same move with only one follow-up (Arm Snap).
- Back Hand Slap: In a quarter circle motion roll the stick D,DF,F and press LP+RP to initiate the throw. This throw is not very damaging and is the only throw to leave the opponent still standing. On its own it does 15 damage.
- Arm Break: Right after grabbing the opponent with the above move, quickly press LP,LK,RP,LP. Nina will grab her opponent's arm and bend it backwards. 20 damage (total 35).
- Double Arm Break: If you thought breaking one arm was enough, the 'Silent Assassin'  will turn around again and break both her opponents arms at the same time. This is done right after the animation changes to 'Arm Break' by pressing LK,LP,RK,LP+RP,LP+RP in the short amount of time. 25 damage (total 60).
- Falling Arm Break: An alternative combo to the Arm Break. Nina will instead fall on top of her opponent's broken arm causing more damage. This is done right after the animation changes to 'Arm Break' by pressing RP,LP,LK,RK,LP+RP in the short amount of time. 25 damage (total 60).
- Arm Snap: Another Back Hand Slap follow-up. Right after grabbing the opponent with the first move, quickly press LK,RK,LK,LP+RP. Nina will wrestle her opponent to the ground and break their arm. 30 damage (total 45).

* Michelle is the only character in Tekken to have a back throw; a special throw which would be available to all characters as of "Tekken 2" and later. Wang (CPU character on stage 8) also has this throw. If you are caught in this move, hold Down to duck the throw.

Spin Behind to Behind Back Suplex: Press Back+RP (spin on hit), then hold LP+RP to initiate back throw. 12+45 damage (total 57).

* Some moves are not blockable if done in sequence: King's 'Exploder' and 'Running Exploder' can be followed up to a rising kick, as can Nina's 'Forward Flip Kick'. The rolling cross chop (all character except Jack) from the ground also has a similar property if a simple left or right punch is made. You can do basic juggle moves (air combos) from this feature.

* 10-Hit Combos (buttons: LP=1, RP=2, LK=3, RK=4): These must be timed so each move corresponds with each hit (or, take advantage of the 'feature' which lets all buttons pressed at once count as each hit after the first). This was fixed in the PlayStation version and later games.

* CONSOLES:
Sony PlayStation (1995): On this version, the Marine Stadium stage was renamed to just Stadium. The AI is also much easier. On the Stadium stage, a big screen reflects you fighting, just like the mirror on the Tekken 2 Devil stage. The music is remixed by default, including the Kazuya intro, but has the option of selecting the original arcade music, however there's no 'arcade' Kazuya intro music. The eight boss characters, as well as Heihachi, can also be unlocked on this game, and have some updated moves from Tekken 2 thrown in. Jack's 'raaah' sound (heard during Lift Up throw) is missing, however P.Jack has it, but P.Jack's 'mreeyah' sound has been replaced by it.
Sony PlayStation 2 (2005, "Tekken 5 Ultimate Collectors Edition")
Sony PlayStation 2 (2005, "NamCollection"): Japan release only.
Sony PlayStation 2 (2005, "Tekken 5"): Available in the Arcade History mode. This game is an updated version of the actual arcade version, with fewer options and no coin settings. The Marine Stadium stage has been renamed to Stadium again. The characters have the arcade AI, but are given sampled sound effects like the PlayStation version.

Tetris - The Grand Master (c) 1998 Arika.

- TRIVIA -

This game was released in Japan only (July 1998).

If you enter the initials '666', 'A  ', 'AA ', 'AAA', 'AHO', 'ASS', 'AUM', 'DIE', 'ETA', 'FUC', 'FUK', 'HIV', 'IRA', 'KKK', 'OSI', 'PEE', 'PIS', 'PLO', or 'SEX', they will be changed to 'ARK', which stands for Arika, the company that made the game.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (TGM The Grand Master - PCCB-00372) on 19/05/1999.

Music from this game was remixed and included in Arika's music game 'Technic Beat' which saw a release in both arcades and on PS2.

- SCORING -

The higher your level, the more points you earn for clearing lines.
You also get more points if you press down to drop or lock a piece.
This game gives you a bonus for clearing lines in a 'Combo' with consecutive pieces.
If you manage to clear the screen entirely, 'BRAVOx4' will appear on the screen and you will get quadruple the points for those lines.

Here is a more technical description of the scoring formula:
Score = ((Level + Lines)/4 + Drop) x Lines x Combo x Bravo

Where (Level + Lines)/4 is rounded up and:
Level is the current level you are on.
Lines is the number of lines you just cleared.
Drop is the number of spaces you dropped the piece. The last space your piece falls does not contribute to this, however locking the piece once it has landed will add 1 to the Drop.
Bravo is equal to 4 if this piece has cleared the screen, and otherwise is 1.
Combo returns to 1 by default every time a piece does not clear lines. Otherwise, it is:
Combo = Combo - 1 + (2 x Lines - 1)

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Conditions for Achieving the Grandmaster Grade: The higher you score, the better your grade will be. However, you need more than a high score to be graded a Grandmaster. You must be at least grade 1 when you reach level 300 and grade S4 when you reach level 500. Finally, you must be grade S9 and reach level 999 in under 13 minutes and 30 seconds (the tricky bit). Good luck!

* Basic Tips for Improving Speed:
1) When a piece is touching your stack, tapping 'down', will lock it in place instantly, saving you a  fraction of a second. These really add up, so keep pushing the game forward as fast as you can handle!
2) It takes the same amount of time to clear a single line as it does to clear a double, triple, or Tetris, so try to be efficient and avoid clearing too many singles.
3) Your level increases by 1 for every line you clear. It also increases by 1  for every piece that appears. However, when you are at levels 99, 199, 299, etc. your level will not increase from falling pieces. You MUST clear a line to proceed (and change the background). Every second you spend without clearing a line is wasted time, so keep an eye on your level and try to have a line ready for the right moment.
4) If you intentionally keep your stack near the top of the screen it will take less time for pieces to fall and you will save time. This is most important at the beginning when pieces fall slowly, and again at level 200 when they slow to a crawl once more. By level 500, pieces will literally fall instantly and it will no longer make a difference how high your stack is.

* Advanced Rotation Techniques:
1) If you press and hold a rotate button before a piece appears, that piece will be rotated instantly as it appears in the field. The attract mode can give you a visual demonstration.
2) When you are rotating a piece, if there are any blocks preventing a rotation then the game will then try to see if there is room for a rotated piece 1 square to the right, and failing that, 1 square to the left. It sounds subtle, but you can use this to get pieces into seemingly impossible locations. Study the visual demonstrations of this in the attract mode.

* Predicting Upcoming Pieces:
1) At the top of the screen, the next piece is displayed.
2) Every piece has its own sound effect. Whenever a piece enters the screen, the sound of the upcoming piece is played. With practice, this knowledge can save you the effort of looking up to find out the next piece.
3) The pieces you get are not purely random. The game keeps a history of the 4 most recent pieces, and every time the game "rolls" a new piece, it will reroll if this piece is found in the history. The game will keep trying to give you a piece not contained in your history, re-rolling as many as 4 times, before finally giving you whatever the last of these rolls happened to be. The implications of this are subtle: You are both unlikely to get flooded with many of the same piece, and unlikely to get starved of any particular piece. Overall the pieces come more regularly than other versions of Tetris, allowing the player to build bold structures (in expectation of upcoming pieces) that would be far too risky with purer randomization. It is also interesting to note that this version of Tetris, a game named after the Greek word for 'four' and using pieces constructed with 4 squares, also keeps a history of 4 pieces and will re-roll up to 4 times.
4) The game will never give you an 'S', 'Z', or 'O' shape as your first piece. Also, every game begins with its history filled with 4 green 'Z' pieces, making these pieces initially unlikely. The odds of getting a Z shape as your second piece, for example, are fewer than 1/1000. Plan your opening moves accordingly.

* Title Screen Codes: Enter these codes at the title screen for the desired effect...
Big Mode (Pieces are much larger in size.): Left(x4), Down, C, B, A.
Mono Mode (Play the game in black and white.): Right(x3), Up, C, B, A.
TLS Mode (Pieces will still have shadows beyond lvl100): A, B, C(x2), B, A(x2), C, B.
Uki Mode (A Japanese child will laugh when you clear lines.): A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B(x2).
20G Mode (Starts the game with the highest gravity of 20 spaces per frame.): Down(x8), C, B, A.
Rev Mode (Pieces rise instead of falling as you play Tetris in reverse.): Down, Up(x2), Down, C, B, A.

* No Item Mode: To play a classic versus game without any items, hold down both player Start buttons when it says 'Here Comes a New Challenger'.

* Another Hidden Game Mode: As you play, leave the bottom left square unfilled so that that line doesn't clear. Also, leave the square up one and right one unfilled so that the second line won't clear. Continue like this, leaving holes diagonally, until you reach the right wall. Then continue diagonally to the left wall. You should be making a pattern that looks like '&gt;'. It's actually rather hard to make the pattern entirely, but try to make as much as you can. After you die the game will recognize this pattern and give you an additional "Secret Grade", according to how much of the pattern you were able to make. Can you achieve Grandmaster in this challenging exercise ?

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 27 years ago:

Xevious 3D/G (c) 1996 Namco.

An excellent sequel in 3-D.

You are the pilot of the mighty combat aircraft 'Solvalou' and must fly through vast zones full of enemies and armed with the classic weaponry the forward-firing gun for aerial targets, and the bombs to destroying ground-based targets and with the addition of a series of new and powerful weapons. 

This game is a very popular sequel to the "Xevious" saga. It became quite popular because of a good 3-D modelling and nice camera work and featuring a nice BGM and sounds.
