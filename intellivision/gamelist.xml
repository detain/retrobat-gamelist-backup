		<name>Abpa Backgammon</name>
		<desc>Intellivision Backgammon is identical with the board game. Backgammon is a game played by two players (the computer can be one of the players). Each player has 15 pieces. The object of the game is to be the first to move all your pieces completely around and finally off the board. Moving your pieces off the board is called "bearing off". The first player to bear off all his pieces is the winner. Each player moves in a direction beginning from his opponent's Home Table and coming around to his own Home Table. Thus one player always moves clockwise and the other always 
counterclockwise.
You can play against the computer at two skill levels - one for beginners or intermediate, another for experts - or two players can compete against each other. It displays the American Backgammon Players Association (ABPA) logo.</desc>

		<name>Bomb Squad</name>
		<desc>The terrorist Boris has placed a bomb in the city! As a member of the bomb squad, it is the player's job to disarm the bomb before it explodes. 

Start the game with a view of the code number display which is damaged. In order to find the code which disarms the bomb, the player has to repair the various circuits in order to fix the display. By selecting a square on the code number display, the player will be brought to the corresponding circuit which can be repaired using cutters, pliers, and soldering iron. The player's partner, Frank, will guide through the repairs by telling the player what needs to be done, in what order repairs should be performed, and by helping the player position the tools. Depending on the circuit, the player may need to cut out parts or replace parts (spare parts are located at the top of the screen). If the player use an incorrect replacement part, or perform the repairs in the wrong order, the player will lose time or even cause the bomb to explode. 

On the more difficult skill levels, circuit parts may even overheat and cause a fire; luckily, the player also have a fire extinguisher with you to deal with this situation! When enough circuits have been repaired, the player can decipher the code, enter it into the computer, and the bomb will be disarmed (an incorrect guess will cause it to explode, however). The player may choose to have a one, two, or three digit code to guess and several difficulty levels are available.</desc>

		<desc>Bump 'N' Jump is an action racing game played from a top down point of view. As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</desc>

		<name>Buzz Bombers</name>
		<desc>Buzz Bombers is an arcade action game similar to Centipede. You control a can of bug spray at the bottom of the screen, and you need to defend yourself from the swarms of incoming bees. The bees start at the top of the screen, and fly their way back and forth, slowly heading towards the bottom of the screen. If they reach the ground, they will pollinate the flowers there which causes them to grow and will restrict movement of your spray can. When you shoot a bee, it will turn into a honeycomb. The honeycombs will cause the bees to head towards the ground even faster, since they will turn around when one is in their way. Your spray can is able to shoot the honeycombs, but if you leave them in place a hummingbird will fly around and eat the honey from them. The more honey the hummingbird eats, the more points you get. The game ends when all of your spray cans are destroyed by growing flowers.</desc>

Then you can choose if an horse must be driven by a player or by the CPU. Only the third and the fourth horse can be driven by the players. There are 3 types of terrain: turf, mud or dry. 
When the race begins, the horses are speedier at the beginning, slower toward the end. They are different for speed at the starting gate, stamina, speed at the straight line, and for speed with different conditions of the race terrain. You (and the CPU too!) have the whip and the coax to spur a horse, and these tools could be useful to win a race even with a more tired horse.</desc>

		<desc>Lock 'n' Chase is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. You play a thief who is trapped in a maze like vault. To get out, you need to collect all of the gold dots located in the maze. Your task won't be easy, since there are four police officers in the vault who are constantly trying to catch you! Located throughout the maze are numerous doors. As you run through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily close a door in an attempt to block the police. You can only close two doors at a time, and any closed doors automatically open again after a short amount of time. When all of the gold in the maze has been collected, the exit to the vault will open and you can escape and move on to the next, more difficult vault. Occasionally a bonus item will appear in the maze, such as a cash bag, crown, or briefcase, which can be collected to earn even more points.</desc>

The game is shown from a side-court angle with team baskets on the left and right sides of the screen.  Characters animate when running, and when dribbling the basketball.  The "floor" does have basic basketball set-up including the center line and free throw lines.  

NBA Basketball is a two-player (only) game and features four quarters, passing, blocking and jump shots.  There is even overtime should it become necessary.

The title screen says only "Basketball," but the box and game cartridge have the NBA emblem and "NBA Basketball" printed on them.</desc>

		<name>Snafu</name>
		<desc>Snafu is an arcade action game similar to the Atari game Surround. You control a constantly moving and growing wall; the goal is to trap all of your opponents before you become trapped yourself. If you crash into the borders of the screen, into another players wall, or your own wall, you are out for that round. The last player left standing wins the round! Several game options are available which allow or forbid diagonal movement, set obstacles in the playfield, allow a players wall to disappear or remain on the screen after they crash, control the speed of movement, and select the number of rounds to play. The game can be played by one or two human players, and optionally two additional computer players can be added for up to four players on the screen at a time.

Also included is a two player only game where you control a serpent containing 10 links, and your goal is to bite the links off of your opponent one at a time. Only the very last link of the serpent can be bitten off, so you need to be sure you keep your tail away from your opponent! The screen walls and the players links are non lethal if you crash into them in this variation, however if you double back accross your own path you will lose a link. The first player to bite off all of his opponents links wins.</desc>

You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

		<name>Super Pro Football</name>
		<desc>Super Pro Football is a one or two-player football game.  There are only two teams, the Home Team and the Visiting Team (orange and blue respectively).  Quarterbacks are colored differently than the rest of the team--red and dark blue for the Home and Visiting teams.

After pressing Enter from the title screen, the player has the options of selecting if the players will be human or computer, and then their difficulty level, or rating--Rookie or Super Pro.  

Prior to playing the game, the player (or computer) can select from a wide list of options and planning strategies for playing the game.  

Options for the Defensive team include Formation, Tactic, Timeout, Stats, Controls, and Break.  "Break" exits the menu and begins gameplay.  "Stats" contains all the current information on the game including the timer, score, down, quarter, and time outs.  There are nine Formations to choose from, and four options under Tactics.  Formations can also be changed on the gameplay screen prior to the opponent team hiking the ball.  Controls are pretty basic, only really involving the control wheel.

The options for the Offensive team include Formation, Kick, Recover 1, Recover 2, Timeout, Stats, Controls, and Break.  A "program receiver" appears under the Recover options.  Like defense, there are nine formation options.  Controls are more involved in offensive play, including hiking, kicking, passing high or low, and running.

The game is seen from a top-down view and scrolls left-to-right to move with the gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>Pit your wits against a friend or challenge the computer in USCF Chess!

Game features include taking back and redoing moves, rotating the game board 180 degrees, and setting up the chess board for special moves and instances. When playing against the CPU, players can also switch sides with the computer to make a move for the CPU. If the computer takes too long to make a move, the player may force the CPU to immediately make the best move it can think of, or cause the game to make an audible tone and pause before making the move.

USCF Chess allows 2-player gameplay or for 1 player against the CPU with 7 difficulty levels available.</desc>

		<desc>The object of Vectron is to construct an energy base, section 
by section. You add each section by moving your energy block in place and filling it with an energy blast. You must protect your energy block against Hungrees, G-spheres, splits, sweeps, and prizums who can destroy it. Shoot them down with energy blasts or neutralize them with special energy from an E-Pak. Don't run out of energy or you lose an energy block. There are three energy blocks per game. When they're gone, the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>Math fun is an educational game which can be played by one or two players. Each player controls a gorilla which is wandering through the jungle. As the gorilla walks on, it will encounter a creature which has a math problem with it. You need to enter in the correct answer to the problem as quickly as possible. If you get the answer correct, your gorilla may continue on. If you get the answer wrong, then your gorilla must jump into the river. Your gorilla is unable to leave the river and continue on until you answer another math problem correctly. The goal is to correctly answer as many of the problems as you can in the shortest amount of time. The game includes eighteen different levels of difficulty which can be set individually for each player.</desc>

The letters drift around the network, and will even try to get away from your spaceship when you get close. When you touch the right letter in the right order, you earn points, but touch a letter that doesn't belong and you lose them. If you collect letters out of order you don't earn as many points. On the higher levels you also have to dodge robots and satellites, which cost more points if you hit them.</desc>

		<desc>Intellivision Backgammon is identical with the board game. Backgammon is a game played by two players (the computer can be one of the players). Each player has 15 pieces. The object of the game is to be the first to move all your pieces completely around and finally off the board. Moving your pieces off the board is called "bearing off". The first player to bear off all his pieces is the winner. Each player moves in a direction beginning from his opponent's Home Table and coming around to his own Home Table. Thus one player always moves clockwise and the other always 
counterclockwise.
You can play against the computer at two skill levels - one for beginners or intermediate, another for experts - or two players can compete against each other. It displays the American Backgammon Players Association (ABPA) logo.</desc>

		<desc>You're piloting a biplane through enemy territory. Drop bombs on factories and ammunition depots. Engage enemy planes in dogfights to the death!  

Due to the popularity (especially with APh and Mattel programmers) of the Biplanes game in the Triple Action cartridge, APh proposed this one-player version. A prototype was shown to Mattel with scrolling mountain terrain and targets that could be bombed. The plane graphics, sound effects and flight control were lifted directly from Biplanes. (Enemy planes, which would have presented an artificial intelligence-programming challenge, were not included in the prototype but promised for the finished game.)  An unfinished but playable version was released in 1998 on the Intellivision Lives! CD.</desc>

		<name>World Series Major League Baseball</name>
		<desc>World Series Major League Baseball is a baseball sports game that supports both ECS and Intellivoice (for play by play announcements). The game is based on real baseball player statistics (even though the names had been changed to fictional ones before the release) and offers baseball games using multiple cameras (including in-game split-screen), showing the game in a 3D display rather than side-scrolling fashion.

It supports two players simultaneously, where a center camera is used to show pitcher and batter. While one player chooses the pitch type, the batter decides when to swing or bunt. The screen then switches to an external camera view for the defending player to control the fielders, while the other player handles the baserunners. The games can be saved and loaded through the RAM chip on the cartridge.</desc>

		<name>Astrosmash</name>
		<desc>In Astrosmash you control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen; your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the various incoming meteors, bombs, and other objects. Points are earned for destroying objects, while points are lost for letting them get past you. Meteors are the most common item you need to defend yourself against. They come in various sizes and colors, and some even split into two smaller meteors when shot.

Mixed in with the meteors are white spinning bombs. While letting a meteor get past you will only lower your score, you have to shoot the spinners. If one gets past, you will lose a life. On the more difficult levels, ufo's and guided missiles will also appear occasionally and attempt to destroy your canon.

If you become trapped in a hopeless situation, your canon can enter hyperspace and be instantly transported to a different location on the screen. Just be careful, sometimes you may be transported to a situation worse than the one you left! The game ends when all of your laser canons have been destroyed.</desc>

		<name>Astrosmash: Meteor</name>
		<desc>Astrosmash was originally conceived when a game called Meteor!, an Asteroids clone, did not fill up the ROM space of an entire cartridge. The extra space was used to create a variation of the game called Avalanche! The Meteor! game was cancelled at the last minute, due to concerns that it was too similar to Asteroids. 
Programmer John Sohl programmed a "branch" around the opening-screen menu, leading directly to the Avalanche! variation, retitled Astrosmash. The games were compatible, since they were designed together, and used the same sprites and sound effects. In rare instances, if the console's reset button is pressed rapidly, an error can occur, resulting in the game starting in the original Meteor! format.
Mattel released the game for the Atari 2600. Renamed Astroblast, it has faster play than the Intellivision original.</desc>

		<desc>B-17 Bomber takes place near the end of World War II. As the pilot of a B-17, your mission is to fly across the English Channel and bomb various strategic targets. First you need to select a destination which features a lot of targets. The further the target is from your home base, the more points you can earn, but with more ground to cover there will be more enemy fighters blocking the target and more fuel will be needed. Once a destination is set, you need to stock your plane with bombs and fuel, then take off! You will now have a first person point of view from the plane and can control which of several views is active. When trying to bomb targets, you will be looking straight down from the bombay doors. When you hear a voice announce incoming enemy planes, you need to switch the view to one of the guns and defend yourself. Lastly you can have a view from the cockpit to control the plane. If your fuel runs low, or your plane takes too much damage, you can fly back to your home base for repairs and then take off again to bomb as many targets as you can!</desc>

The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occassionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</desc>

		<desc>The Object of Body Slam: Super Pro Wrestling is to defeat your opponent in the ring. You must use strength, strategy, and a hint of sneakiness. Each match consists of a series of four-minute rounds. There is an unlimited number of rounds, so the match continues until a player wins or until a draw is declared. The first wrestler to pin his opponent to the mat for a time of 3 seconds is the winner.

You control a wrestler selected from 12 different characters. Your 
opponent is controlled by another player or by the computer. If 
you choose a Tag-Team Match you and your opponent each 
control 2 wrestlers who take turns in the ring.

There are 26 possible moves - drops, kicks, punches, etc. Before each match, you choose 4 to 9 moves (depending upon your selected skill level) that you will use in that match. How many moves you can make during the match is determined by your selected skill level: the lower the skill level, the fewer the moves. Players may select different skill levels to handicap the match. The 12 wrestlers you have to choose from, have their relative strengths and weaknesses depending from their height, weight, strength, coordination, and ego.</desc>

		<name>Bomb Squad</name>
		<desc>The terrorist Boris has placed a bomb in the city! As a member of the bomb squad, it is the player's job to disarm the bomb before it explodes. 

Start the game with a view of the code number display which is damaged. In order to find the code which disarms the bomb, the player has to repair the various circuits in order to fix the display. By selecting a square on the code number display, the player will be brought to the corresponding circuit which can be repaired using cutters, pliers, and soldering iron. The player's partner, Frank, will guide through the repairs by telling the player what needs to be done, in what order repairs should be performed, and by helping the player position the tools. Depending on the circuit, the player may need to cut out parts or replace parts (spare parts are located at the top of the screen). If the player use an incorrect replacement part, or perform the repairs in the wrong order, the player will lose time or even cause the bomb to explode. 

On the more difficult skill levels, circuit parts may even overheat and cause a fire; luckily, the player also have a fire extinguisher with you to deal with this situation! When enough circuits have been repaired, the player can decipher the code, enter it into the computer, and the bomb will be disarmed (an incorrect guess will cause it to explode, however). The player may choose to have a one, two, or three digit code to guess and several difficulty levels are available.</desc>

		<desc>SDK-1600 is a fully-fledged development kit for the Intellivision * video-game system. The tools contained within it were used to write the first new game in a decade for the Intellivision: 4-Tris. SDK-1600 derives its name from the CP-1600 CPU that lies at the heart of the Intellivision. You can run the programs created with this kit using one of the available Intellivision Emulators, or by using Chad Schell's Intellicart.

Here are various demos included in SDK-1600. Altogether, 19 complete Intellivision programs and over 2 dozen library functions are provided.</desc>

		<name>Brickout</name>
		<desc>An alien force field has blocked your only means of escape, preventing you from returning home. Your only hope is to use your supply of proton balls to try and destroy the field, one block at a time. Use your deflector to bounce proton balls against descending rows of energy layers. When a ball contacts the force field, it will neutralize that part of the barrier. But just when you think you're making some headway, more layers appear to seal you in. Just how much damage can you do to the force field before running out of proton balls?

Features

A one player action game.
Blast your way through the mysterious force field.
Take control and rack up a huge score!
Wave after wave to blast through!
Stay focused as endless layers descend upon you.</desc>

		<desc>Bump 'N' Jump is an action racing game played from a top down point of view. As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.

The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.</desc>

		<desc>Buzz Bombers is an arcade action game similar to Centipede. You control a can of bug spray at the bottom of the screen, and you need to defend yourself from the swarms of incoming bees. The bees start at the top of the screen, and fly their way back and forth, slowly heading towards the bottom of the screen. If they reach the ground, they will pollinate the flowers there which causes them to grow and will restrict movement of your spray can. When you shoot a bee, it will turn into a honeycomb. The honeycombs will cause the bees to head towards the ground even faster, since they will turn around when one is in their way. Your spray can is able to shoot the honeycombs, but if you leave them in place a hummingbird will fly around and eat the honey from them. The more honey the hummingbird eats, the more points you get. The game ends when all of your spray cans are destroyed by growing flowers.</desc>

		<desc>In this unofficial sequel to the arcade game BurgerTime, the Rotten Foods (Hot Dogs, Cherries, Bananas, and their leader Mugsy, the Mug o' Root Beer) have thrown lunch all over the diner and Peter Pepper has to get it back on the plate. 

The game is for 1 or 2 players (but in this case they have to choose two different difficulty levels). Peter Pepper must kick the Food Balls (red Meatballs, green Lettuce Heads, white Rice, tan Mashed Potatoes, and yellow Macaroni) scattered throughout the diner. The Food Ball will roll across the floor, down ramps, and over ledges. If it's close enough to the bottom of the screen, it will roll right onto the plate.

When a plate is full, Side Orders appear in the diner: if Peter picks them up, he earns 250 points and 1 pepper. When he fills 4 plates (finish four game screens), he enters the Blue Plate Special bonus round: Food Balls start raining across the screen and Peter can eat all them, but the flashing ones, for extra points.

With them he can squish the Rotten Food too, earning extra points. He can shake pepper to stop them momentarily or simply run away. If a Rotten Food touch him, he loses a turn. Peter can obtain a new turn every 20.000 points. If he run out of turns the game ends.</desc>

As Dracula bites his victims, his actions will call the attention of the local constable who will try to slow him down by driving a stake into him.  Dracula can respond by either turning one of his victims into zombies to attack the police, or by transforming into a bat to escape capture.  Even the forces of nature are against the vampire, as wolves will attack him on foot, and hawks will drag away his bat form.  Dracula must feed on a certain number of victims and return to his tomb before sunrise, or he will not survive to feed another night.</desc>

You will have to jump and duck the dragons fireballs as well as avoid flying arrows to reach the other side! In the second part you need to collect all of the treasures on the screen and make it to the exit while avoiding the dragon who runs across the bottom of the screen. The dragons on each level have different patterns of movement and firing, and as the levels progress will become faster and trickier.</desc>

As Duncan skates he weakens the ice; if he skates completely around another penguin -- KER-PLASH! -- the ice collapses and the penguin falls into the pond. Duncan has only two worries -- the seal who loves to bounce him on her nose, and the lumbering polar bears who like to bat him around.

You control Duncan by pressing the hand controller DISC.  Skate around the other penguins, dunking them in the pond. Avoid or dunk the seal and polar bears. Gobble shrimp cocktails for extra speed. Dunk all of the penguins, then take the Zamboni ice resurfacer out for a spin to fix up the pond -- more penguins show up and the game continues at the next level, harder than before!</desc>

		<desc>Neptina, Neptune's daughter, has been imprisoned at the bottom of the sea by Titans. Your goal is to rescue her by locating the scattered pieces of a magical trident! You will need to take the form of a dolphin and a bird in order to locate the pieces that are hidden in the ocean and clouds. When flying in the air, there are several screens that have clouds flying by. Touch all of the clouds, and the trident piece appears! Other birds which are flying around will cause you to lose energy if you touch them accidentally. Underwater, trident pieces can be found by touching the sea horses. Octopuses, sharks, and a deadly maze of seaweed will get in your way and cause you to lose energy if caught! When you have located all of the trident pieces, the cage holding Neptina can be unlocked, but if you run out of energy first the game will be over.</desc>

		<desc>You control one of two frogs sitting on a lily pad in a bog. The object of the game is to eat as many flies as you can in the three minute time limit. Your frog can jump back and forth between the two lily pads in order to catch the flies that go by overhead. When jumping, be careful not to fall in the water or your frog will have to swim back to the lily pad which can waste time. The game can be played during the day, or at night making it more difficult to see the flies. At the end of the time limit, whichever player has eaten more flies wins! One player can compete against a computer controlled frog, or two players against each other.</desc>

		<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<desc>Happy Trails is an action strategy game for one or two players. Black Bart has robbed the stagecoach, and you need to recover all of the stolen money within the given time limit! The money is located in various locations in a series of maze-like paths. The paths are broken up into tiles, and there is one tile missing so you can rearrange the maze by moving a tile into the empty space. As your character walks through the paths, you need to rearrange the tiles to make sure there is always a connected path in front of him (or you'll lose a life) and to guide him towards the money bags. When all of the money has been recovered, you move on to the next round. On the more difficult rounds, Black Bart will also be wandering around the maze trying to stop you! You should avoid him at all costs, unless you have first collected a star which gives your character temporary invincibility.</desc>

		<desc>This game is for 1 up to 6 players. When the game begins, you can place the bets, for the winner or  for the first and second place. Then you can choose if an horse must be driven by a player or by the CPU. Only the third and the fourth horse can be driven by the players. There are 3 types of terrain: turf, mud or dry. 
When the race begins, the horses are speedier at the beginning, slower toward the end. They are different for speed at the starting gate, stamina, speed at the straight line, and for speed with different conditions of the race terrain. You (and the CPU too!) have the whip and the coax to spur a horse, and these tools could be useful to win a race even with a more tired horse.</desc>

The terrorists hits can damage the engine, the navigation system, the cannons and the radar.

		<desc>2 children are trapped in a haunted house full of evil Thirsties! Guide the children through the house to find all of the ingredients for a batch of Kool-Aid!

The children initially move together through the house, but if one of the children is attacked by a roaming Thirsty, the children separate, and are now controlled one at a time. If a child is attacked twice, that child is out of the game. If both children are attacked twice, the game is over.

Once all ingredients for Kool-Aid (sugar, Kool-Aid, and a pitcher) are placed near the kitchen sink, Kool-Aid Man appears and is now controlled by the player! Use Kool-Aid Man to collect roaming fruit and to destroy the Thirsties. Once the Thirsties have been defeated, the round is over, and the game starts over with a higher difficulty level (unless "kiddy mode" was selected at game start-up.)

Kool-Aid Man is for 1 player, and offers 13 difficulty settings, including a children's mode which never increases in difficulty during gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Lady Bug</name>
		<desc>An action game in the same style as Pac-Man but very very different. Players control a ladybug who must venture around different mazes collecting all of the food pellet "x"'s. In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game.  In the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete "lap". Timers for the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.

In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that colour's word. The red word is "SPECIAL" and the yellow word is "EXTRA". Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.

Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.</desc>

		<desc>Land Battle is a two player war game which utilizes both strategic and tactical modes of play. Each player controls an array of forces with the objective of capturing or destroying his opponent's "flag."

The game can be played on any of thousands of different countryside maps -- the first thousand of which are selectable at the beginning of the game. All of these maps show roads, towns, hills, lakes, forests, orchards, and fields, and these geographic features impose restrictions and necessitate clever planning on the part of the player.</desc>

		<name>Loco-motion</name>
		<desc>Based on a 1982 coin-op, Loco-Motion is a puzzle-style arcade game in which a train is riding on a grid of movable track pieces. The goal is to guide the train through the train stations located around the edge of the playfield. An empty section in the grid allows the player to shift adjacent track pieces into that section to alter the train's path, and a tracing light shows the path the train is taking as it moves. An accelerator button moves the train more quickly on its path, and a panic button will switch the piece of track the train is on with a random track piece on the grid.

A bonus timer ticks down during gameplay, showing how many points will be received if the train arrives at a station in a timely fashion. If the timer reaches zero, "Crazy Trains" and "Loop Sweepers" will appear and race down the track in an attempt to crash into your train. Other obstacles include "Crazy Tracks" which can send your train in another direction, and exploding stations (occurring occasionally if the bonus timer reaches zero.)

Loco-Motion has 4 play speeds, and offers play for 1 player or 2 players alternating turns.</desc>

		<name>Masters of the Universe: The Power of He-Man</name>
		<desc>In Masters of the Universe, you control He-Man as he battles Skeletor in two different types of arcade action scenes. In the first part of the game, you control the Wind Raider flying towards Castle Grayskull. You have a limited amount of fuel with which to reach your destination, plus numerous fireballs will be flying around the screen trying to stop you and Skeletor will be running along the ground. The Wind Raider is equipped with bombs and guns which can be used to defend yourself from the fireballs, and also can earn bonus points if you can hit Skeletor. The second part of the game takes place on foot. When you've landed near the castle, He-Man needs to pursue Skeletor. Skeletor will be firing numerous lightning bolts which can be blocked with a shield. There is a time limit here, and you must get past all of the screens and catch Skeletor before time runs out. If you are successful, the game will repeat at a tougher skill level.</desc>

		<desc>You're a microsurgeon, and your patient is in critical condition! First you need to examine the patient's medical chart to find out what's wrong, and which conditions are the most critical. Now to save the patient, you control a robot probe which can be used to administer aspirin, antiseptic, or ultrasonics to clear up the problem. You should clear up the most critical conditions first, then move on to the less serious areas to ensure your patient survives. Your probe should navigate through the veins, arteries, and lymph; if you guide the probe outside these areas, it's movement will slow down and swarms of white blood cells will attack it, depleting the limited energy supply. There are 197 different patients you need to help, each with different ailments.</desc>

		<desc>NBA Basketball is an early, very basic basketball game.  While officially licensed by the NBA, the game contains no team names or players to speak of.  There are only two teams, a Home team and a Visitor team.  The Home team is red and the Visitor team is green.  

The game is shown from a side-court angle with team baskets on the left and right sides of the screen.  Characters animate when running, and when dribbling the basketball.  The "floor" does have basic basketball set-up including the center line and free throw lines.  

NBA Basketball is a two-player (only) game and features four quarters, passing, blocking and jump shots.  There is even overtime should it become necessary.

		<desc>NFL Football contains almost all the elements of a real football game. The game consists of four quarters, fifteen minutes each. There are four difficulty levels; high school, college, semi-pro, and pro. There are nine different plays to call, including running plays, field goals, passing plays, and punting. The only thing that's not realistic about NFL Football is the teams only have five players on offense and on defense.</desc>

		<desc>NHL Hockey is a two-player, action hockey game for the Intellivision. Players control their team's puck handler, while the CPU controls all other team members, including the goalie. The players can either shoot the puck quickly or pass it slowly, and can also trip other players (at the risk of a penalty if they do not have the puck.) Stealing the puck and intercepting shots are also possible during gameplay. NHL Hockey features 4 different speed settings, selectable at the beginning of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Nova Blast is a side-scrolling sci-fi shooter in which your must defend 4 shielded cities from invaders that attack from both in the air and on the ground. Each city has a bubble shield that can sustain one hit; another hit to an unshielded city will destroy it.

Players control a ship that can fire lasers horizontally and drop bomb vertically. The ship is also equipped with an energy beam that can absorb energy from energy tanks, and can also use that energy to create temporary shields around unprotected cities. The ship can also sustain up to 10 blows in each round. If all 4 cities are destroyed or the ship takes 10 hits in a round, the game ends.

Nova Blast is a single player game with 3 difficulty levels.</desc>

		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<desc>PGA Golf is a golf game played from an overhead point of view. Up to four players can compete on a nine hole, par 38 course containing a variety of terrain (greens, fairway, rough, water, and sand) as well as numerous trees. Each player has nine clubs (3 woods, 4 irons, a wedge, and a putter) and is able hook, slice, and control the power of each shot. You will receive penalty strokes for balls that land out of bounds and in the water, and of course the lowest score at the end of the round wins!</desc>

		<desc>Pinball is a pinball simulation for one or two players. You begin the game with five balls, and need to score as many points as possible by hitting the ball into the various bumpers and targets on the pinball table. The pinball table consists of three different screens, each with a different layout and level of difficulty. To advance from one screen to the next, you need to use a single ball to hit several targets and then get the ball into a white cup that appears. If you are on the second or third screen and the ball falls off the bottom, you will be back to the lower screen; if the ball falls off the bottom screen you will lose that ball. The game ends when all five balls have been lost.</desc>

With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</desc>

Other objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!</desc>

To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>

Steve Montero developed this game at Activision after programming the robot-themed Night Stalker at Mattel Electronics.  The game was completed in late 1983, just as Activision decided to give up on releasing new Intellivision titles.  It was finally released in 2001 on the Intellivision Rocks CD.</desc>

		<desc>Safecracker puts you in the role of one of history's greatest spies as you drive around the streets of a foreign city and abscond with secretive cameras, keys, microfilm, flasks of chemicals, and bars of gold bullion.

While cruising around the city, you should avoid crashing into curbs or other cars. You can shoot the cars if you like, but this will bring the Secret Police and their bullets. You should make your way to one of the embassies, where you can learn the combination needed to open the treasury vault. This is also where you can find most of the secretive items. After picking the combination locks of four embassies, you will have both secret numbers needed to open the treasury safe, which contains the gold.

The most profitable way to crack a safe is to pick its combination numbers by finding the right number sequences. This involves cycling through various numbers (0 through 99) on your keypad. Pick numbers until there are no more to find. If you find yourself running out of time, you can simply blow up the safe with dynamite. However, you will not score any points, and the Secret Police will respond to an alarm that will automatically be set off.</desc>

The ever-popular television cartoon dog had his first video game conversion in this maze game similar to  Pac-Man.  You control Scooby as he chases ghosts through a maze while himself being chased by the skull &amp; crossbones.  If three ghosts are caught within a time-limit, the skull will disappear and a submarine sandwich appears. When eaten, it gives you a magic bone which when dropped in the path of the skull will momentarily freeze it in place.  When Scooby is caught by the skull, the difficulty will go down.  There's 10 mazes in all, but with the keyboard addon for Intellivision you can also make your own mazes.</desc>

The winner is the player who commands the troop transport ship into the opponent's harbor. There are two phases in Sea Battle; the strategy phase, and the combat phase. The strategy phase includes maneuvering your fleet into different strategic positions on the map, laying mines, and repair fleets. Opponents engage in ship-to-ship warfare in the combat phase, triggered by the ENGAGE button. Each of the different types of ships has there own strengths and weaknesses, such as weapon range and maneuverability.</desc>

		<name>Sewer Sam</name>
		<desc>It's a lovely day and Sam is waiting in Central Park to meet his girlfriend Sally. He sees her and walks to her. He only has eyes for her and before he realizes it he finds himself in the New York sewer system.

Three Russian submarines have been located in the New York sewer system and they have blocked off the system.
Sam's only way out of the sewer system is to destroy the Russian submarines. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.
Sam can't go back... once he's gone through the City Sewer Department seals the tunnel. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.

The sewer system has three types of sewer tunnels. Tunnels with solid dry floors, tunnels with a water passage in the middle and tunnels with pits. 
Sam can walk, run and creep through the tunnels but Sam can't move as quickly in water.
Sam can move from tunnel to tunnel by entering one of the passages that appear occasionally on his way.
Each time he enters a new sewer, Sam receives a fresh supply of oxygen.

On it's way through the sewer system Sam is under attack by nasties like rats, bats, spiders and more.
The ultimate nasties are the Russian submarines. They are located only in water canals. The status bar at the top of the screen contains a distance indicator. It tells you how far Sam has traveled into the sewer. If it's red, it means there's a dreaded submarine at the end of the sewer.
The more nasty elements you shoot, the higher you'll score.</desc>

As player/owner, you run, pass, shoot, defend, and rebound. Keep an eye on your players - if they tire, they play more poorly. And keep an eye on the 24 second shot clock!</desc>

		<name>Slap Shot: Super Pro Hockey</name>
		<desc>Super Pro Hockey is a one or two-player hockey game.  There are four handicap/skill levels to choose from after selecting whether or not the player wants a one or two-player game: Amateur, Rookie, Pro, Super Pro.  Essentially, changing the handicap results in changing speeds to the gameplay, from low (Amateur) to high (Super Pro).  There are no teams, only Home and Visitor.  

Each team has three players and a goalie.  The home team is tan and the visitor team is green.  The player can only control one character at at time, and this character is colored lighter than the rest of the player's team.  Goalies are controlled by the computer.

The game also features a special slap shot button, a penalty box, face-offs, interceptions, and tripping.  

Tripping is considered a "legal" move if applied to the opponent character with the puck.  Penalties occur when a player trips an opponent character without a puck, and one player will be removed to the penalty box.  The team with the penalized player must now defend for a short time with one less man.  Supposedly, the computer "referee" will only call a penalty about one in three times tripping occurs.

Various stats are maintained at the top of the screen, including score, penalty time, remaining time and which period the game is currently in.  Periods are shown as bars on the screen rather than numbers--one for first, two for second, three for third.

The game has been criticized for essentially being little more than the original Intellivision NHL Hockey game with an added single player mode.</desc>

		<desc>Snafu is an arcade action game similar to the Atari game Surround. You control a constantly moving and growing wall; the goal is to trap all of your opponents before you become trapped yourself. If you crash into the borders of the screen, into another players wall, or your own wall, you are out for that round. The last player left standing wins the round! Several game options are available which allow or forbid diagonal movement, set obstacles in the playfield, allow a players wall to disappear or remain on the screen after they crash, control the speed of movement, and select the number of rounds to play. The game can be played by one or two human players, and optionally two additional computer players can be added for up to four players on the screen at a time.

Also included is a two player only game where you control a serpent containing 10 links, and your goal is to bite the links off of your opponent one at a time. Only the very last link of the serpent can be bitten off, so you need to be sure you keep your tail away from your opponent! The screen walls and the players links are non lethal if you crash into them in this variation, however if you double back accross your own path you will lose a link. The first player to bite off all of his opponents links wins.</desc>

You control a laser gun at the bottom of the screen; your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the waves of attacking aliens at the top of the screen. The aliens march steadily downward, and if they reach the ground or you run out of laser guns, the game is over. When all aliens in a wave are destroyed, you move on to the next, more challenging round. From time to time, a flying saucer will pass by at the top of the screen which can be shot for bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>Like the ancient Spartans that fought (and won) the Persian army in the battle of the Thermopylae, you are the last stand before the alien invasion. 

The game has two screens. When it begins, a female voice welcomes you as the commander of the star ship. You have three star bases to defend while alien ships surround you. Then you choose a space sector where you enter in to the battle section. 

Your ship has 5 systems (Battle Computer, Impulse Drive, Hyper Drive, Tracking Computer and Shields): if your  ship is hit you can repair the damage at a star base. Repairs during battles are allowed, but they are slower, use ship's energy and can't repair destroyed ship systems. The game ends when you run out of energy and/or your ship is destroyed. The ship is destroyed when all the systems are destroyed, or if Hyper Drive blows the ship up (50% chance of this occurring if you use Hyper Drive when destroyed).</desc>

As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!</desc>

To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

		<name>Super Pro Football</name>
		<desc>Super Pro Football is a one or two-player football game.  There are only two teams, the Home Team and the Visiting Team (orange and blue respectively).  Quarterbacks are colored differently than the rest of the team--red and dark blue for the Home and Visiting teams.

After pressing Enter from the title screen, the player has the options of selecting if the players will be human or computer, and then their difficulty level, or rating--Rookie or Super Pro.  

Prior to playing the game, the player (or computer) can select from a wide list of options and planning strategies for playing the game.  

Options for the Defensive team include Formation, Tactic, Timeout, Stats, Controls, and Break.  "Break" exits the menu and begins gameplay.  "Stats" contains all the current information on the game including the timer, score, down, quarter, and time outs.  There are nine Formations to choose from, and four options under Tactics.  Formations can also be changed on the gameplay screen prior to the opponent team hiking the ball.  Controls are pretty basic, only really involving the control wheel.

The options for the Offensive team include Formation, Kick, Recover 1, Recover 2, Timeout, Stats, Controls, and Break.  A "program receiver" appears under the Recover options.  Like defense, there are nine formation options.  Controls are more involved in offensive play, including hiking, kicking, passing high or low, and running.

The game is seen from a top-down view and scrolls left-to-right to move with the gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>A one or two player "Dungeons &amp; Dragons"-style dungeon crawl.  In a one-player game, the player controls the Warrior Prince on his quest to collect treasures, learn the secrets of the Fortress of the Sinister Serpent, and locate the Serpent's lair. In a two-player game, the right player controls the Warrior Prince, while the left player controls Nilrem the Wizard.

As you explore the labyrinthine fortress you can collect treasures, magic scrolls, and healing items while battling Phantom Knights and Red Sorcerers.  But be careful -- if your adversaries catch you, you can lose half a life, and may need to be "reincarnated."  Each player has only 9 Reincarnations, and when those are gone, it's "Game Over."</desc>

		<desc>In this medieval fantasy game, players take control of a brave knight as he sets out on a quest of treasure hunting and survival.  The quest takes the knight into three different realms of danger, each with its own challenges, and an ever changing maze of which they must navigate through.  The quest is broken down into these challenges:

Forest - The Knight must confront three dragons, each one more difficult than the last.  Along the way, an enchanted bat will give him the strength to overcome the danger.

Castle - The Knight must overcome six wizards, his only aid being a mouse that will generally try to avoid capture.

Dungeon - A randomly appearing skull is the only defense against the nine demons that make up the sinister dungeons.

Along the way, the items that the Knight will find may be of some help (or hinder) his quest to make it through the different areas.  Challenge the areas again and again for the highest score possible!</desc>

		<desc>Reaching high towards the heavens, the Tower of Doom stands, beckoning brave adventures to confront the bizarre creatures and brave the deadly traps it contains in hopes of collecting the bountiful treasures and magical items found within its corridors.

Tower of Doom is a single-player, Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired adventure title created exclusively for the Intellivision. Choose from 10 different character classes, each with its own strengths. 7 different quests are available for play, with the harder quests featuring randomized maps and magic item effects. After choosing the quest to embark on, players will then control their character using a top-down view of the section of the dungeon they are in, the corridors and rooms being drawn on-screen as they explore them. Also to the player's disposal is a display of the character's inventory which can be utilized at any time, and an on-screen map of the entire dungeon. Encountering a creature will initiate a battle screen at which time players can fight the creature or attempt to bribe it with items they have discovered. Magic items and traps can also be found in the dungeon, each having unique effects on the player.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the movie from Walt Disney, you play a man trapped in a computer world who must keep moving to avoid being hurt.

Enemies will come at you three at a time, and will throw discs at you.  You must keep moving to avoid them while also firing discs right back at them.  There are different doors you can enter that will teleport you to another part of the room, giving you a chance to catch the enemies off guard.

There are two skill levels, and the higher your score, the harder the game becomes.  Do good, and your enemies will move faster, become more accurate, and the discs will go much faster.</desc>

		<desc>You play the role of Flynn, who's been zapped into the circuits of the Master Control Program (MCP). The MCP has plans for world domination, and only Flynn can stop it.

The ultimate goal of Maze-A-Tron is to disable the MCP. Maze-A-Tron is played in rounds; Circuit Maze and the Master Control Program. You go around the maze and collect energy for your shields, which can be used to protect Flynn from some enemies. You also collect zeroes that are used to clear RAM. 

When you proceed to the Master Control Program, the MCP works to fix the RAM you cleared. Your goal here is to fire a Bit-Gun at pairs of BIT streams and BIT stacks before they hit the top of the screen.

These two phases repeat with a higher difficulty each time.</desc>

		<desc>Take the role of Flynn in Tron: Solar Sailer, an Intellivoice game based on the movie Tron. Navigate your way through the computer world to find the MCP (Master Computer Program). Overload the MCP to escape the computer world and return to reality!

Tron: Solar Sailer is a 1-player game with 2 stages of gameplay. In stage one, the player is given an access code to write down, and then is to guide the solar sailer down tracks in the computer world with the goal of reaching Track 0, where the MCP is located. As the player traverses the tracks, tanks attempt to shoot the sailer and recognizers attempted to move the sailer farther away from Track 0. I/O beams teleport the player closer to the MCP if they can properly enter the access code given to them at the beginning of the game. Moving down a track and shooting at enemies depletes energy from the track; switching tracks restores energy to full. If energy fully depletes before the player switches tracks, the sailer stops moving and the game is over. Energy levels can be monitored by the amount of "energy bugs" on the grid surrounding the track, with more bugs meaning more track energy. An audible warning also announces when track energy is low.

If the player makes it to Track 0, stage two begins. The player is placed in the heart of the MCP as it attempts to make continuous data transmissions to keep the player from entering the override code, thereby overloading the MCP and allowing Flynn to escape the computer program. 0s and 1s fly at the player in a first-person view. An in-game voice gives the player the override code in binary, and the player uses a cursor to catch the appropriate bits. Using the number pad, the player can then specify where in the code sequence the captured bit should go. Red bits, when colliding with the cursor, automatically fill in a randomly selected part of the sequence. This area is timed, so the code must be entered as quickly as possible!

Once the correct sequence has been entered, the MCP overloads and the game is over. However, the game gives the option of going into "Overtime Mode" for extra points, at which point the player attempts to block all incoming transmissions or lose the game.</desc>

When you collect the treasure from each of the chambers in a dungeon, you can then move on to the next, more difficult dungeon.</desc>

		<desc>In White Water! your goal is to raft down a river in the shortest time possible. The river features many dangerous turns, rocks, whirlpools, barrels, and other obstacles that get in your way. You begin your trip with three men, and if you don't navigate carefully they can fall out of the raft! If any men remain in the raft, they can try pick up anyone who has fallen out but must do so before they hit a rock, a whirlpool, or leave the screen (if all of your men fall out of the raft, the game will end). In the easier game variations, your score is based on how quickly you can reach the finish line. In the more difficult game variations, you not only need to reach the finish line as quickly as possible but also need to earn points by landing your raft at various beaches along the way and collecting treasures that can be found in the forest. Some of the treasures will be guarded by the natives, so be careful (also be sure not to wander too far into the forest, or you'll become lost). The game ends when you reach the finish line, or all your men are lost either by falling in the river or in the forest.</desc>

		<desc>World Series Major League Baseball is a baseball sports game that supports both ECS and Intellivoice (for play by play announcements). The game is based on real baseball player statistics (even though the names had been changed to fictional ones before the release) and offers baseball games using multiple cameras (including in-game split-screen), showing the game in a 3D display rather than side-scrolling fashion.

It supports two players simultaneously, where a center camera is used to show pitcher and batter. While one player chooses the pitch type, the batter decides when to swing or bunt. The screen then switches to an external camera view for the defending player to control the fielders, while the other player handles the baserunners. The games can be saved and loaded through the RAM chip on the cartridge.</desc>

But due to his laziness, all of the bugs have now arrived and are trying to eat every last bit of corn! You control Felton who is armed with a spray gun. Your crop of corn is displayed on the left side of the screen, and you need to protect it from the incoming hoard of inchworms, moths, caterpillars, slugs, and other assorted bugs which approach rapidly from the right. If any of the bugs sneak past you, they will eat part of your corn crop. The game ends when all of the corn has been eaten. On each level you need to spray all of the bugs that appear in order to move on to the next round; as the rounds progress, the bugs become faster, more numerous, and home in quicker on the corn.</desc>

Yogi needs to learn a lesson so Ranger Smith decides to put Yogi to work in the apple fields. His job is to fill up the cart and take the filled cart back to camp.
Being smarter than the average bear, Yogi concocts a conveyor belt that carries the apples down the hill.
Someone is out to get Yogi though and attempts to sabotage him by taking his basket away preventing him from send enough apples to the cart.
To make sure they succeed, they also clog the conveyor belt with a contraption that knocks the apples off the conveyor belt.
It is a good thing Yogi has a trusted and reliable friend.
Boo Boo is tasked with returning Yogi's baskets to him and stopping the contraption that knocks the apples off the conveyor belt.</desc>

		<desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

Due to the popularity (especially with APh and Mattel programmers) of the Biplanes game in the Triple Action cartridge, APh proposed this one-player version. A prototype was shown to Mattel with scrolling mountain terrain and targets that could be bombed. The plane graphics, sound effects and flight control were lifted directly from Biplanes. (Enemy planes, which would have presented an artificial intelligence-programming challenge, were not included in the prototype but promised for the finished game.)  An unfinished but playable version was released in 1998 on the Intellivision Lives! CD.</desc>

Points are earned for destroying objects, while points are lost for letting them get past you. Meteors are the most common item you need to defend yourself against. They come in various sizes and colors, and some even split into two smaller meteors when shot.

Mixed in with the meteors are white spinning bombs. While letting a meteor get past you will only lower your score, you have to shoot the spinners. If one gets past, you will lose a life. On the more difficult levels, ufo's and guided missiles will also appear occasionally and attempt to destroy your canon.

If you become trapped in a hopeless situation, your canon can enter hyperspace and be instantly transported to a different location on the screen. Just be careful, sometimes you may be transported to a situation worse than the one you left! The game ends when all of your laser canons have been destroyed.</desc>

		<name>B-17 Bomber</name>
		<desc>B-17 Bomber takes place near the end of World War II. As the pilot of a B-17, your mission is to fly across the English Channel and bomb various strategic targets. First you need to select a destination which features a lot of targets. The further the target is from your home base, the more points you can earn, but with more ground to cover there will be more enemy fighters blocking the target and more fuel will be needed. Once a destination is set, you need to stock your plane with bombs and fuel, then take off! You will now have a first person point of view from the plane and can control which of several views is active. When trying to bomb targets, you will be looking straight down from the bombay doors. When you hear a voice announce incoming enemy planes, you need to switch the view to one of the guns and defend yourself. Lastly you can have a view from the cockpit to control the plane. If your fuel runs low, or your plane takes too much damage, you can fly back to your home base for repairs and then take off again to bomb as many targets as you can!</desc>

		<name>BeamRider</name>
		<desc>Beamrider is a 3-D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occassionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</desc>

		<name>Body Slam: Super Pro Wrestling</name>
		<desc>The Object of Body Slam: Super Pro Wrestling is to defeat your opponent in the ring. You must use strength, strategy, and a hint of sneakiness. Each match consists of a series of four-minute rounds. There is an unlimited number of rounds, so the match continues until a player wins or until a draw is declared. The first wrestler to pin his opponent to the mat for a time of 3 seconds is the winner.

You control a wrestler selected from 12 different characters. Your 
opponent is controlled by another player or by the computer. If 
you choose a Tag-Team Match you and your opponent each 
control 2 wrestlers who take turns in the ring.

There are 26 possible moves - drops, kicks, punches, etc. Before each match, you choose 4 to 9 moves (depending upon your selected skill level) that you will use in that match. How many moves you can make during the match is determined by your selected skill level: the lower the skill level, the fewer the moves. Players may select different skill levels to handicap the match. The 12 wrestlers you have to choose from, have their relative strengths and weaknesses depending from their height, weight, strength, coordination, and ego.</desc>

		<desc>An alien force field has blocked your only means of escape, preventing you from returning home. Your only hope is to use your supply of proton balls to try and destroy the field, one block at a time. Use your deflector to bounce proton balls against descending rows of energy layers. When a ball contacts the force field, it will neutralize that part of the barrier. But just when you think you're making some headway, more layers appear to seal you in. Just how much damage can you do to the force field before running out of proton balls?

Features

A one player action game.
Blast your way through the mysterious force field.
Take control and rack up a huge score!
Wave after wave to blast through!
Stay focused as endless layers descend upon you.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.

The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.</desc>

The bees start at the top of the screen, and fly their way back and forth, slowly heading towards the bottom of the screen. If they reach the ground, they will pollinate the flowers there which causes them to grow and will restrict movement of your spray can. When you shoot a bee, it will turn into a honeycomb. The honeycombs will cause the bees to head towards the ground even faster, since they will turn around when one is in their way. Your spray can is able to shoot the honeycombs, but if you leave them in place a hummingbird will fly around and eat the honey from them. The more honey the hummingbird eats, the more points you get. The game ends when all of your spray cans are destroyed by growing flowers.</desc>

You can learn many pocket billiard (pool) and carom billiard games in the privacy and comfort of your own home - and brush up on rules and strategy before venturing out to a billiard parlor. Play against a friend, or practice "against yourself" -- in 1 player games, you control both players 1 and 2.</desc>

		<desc>In this unofficial sequel to the arcade game BurgerTime, the Rotten Foods (Hot Dogs, Cherries, Bananas, and their leader Mugsy, the Mug o' Root Beer) have thrown lunch all over the diner and Peter Pepper has to get it back on the plate. 

The game is for 1 or 2 players (but in this case they have to choose two different difficulty levels). Peter Pepper must kick the Food Balls (red Meatballs, green Lettuce Heads, white Rice, tan Mashed Potatoes, and yellow Macaroni) scattered throughout the diner. The Food Ball will roll across the floor, down ramps, and over ledges. If it's close enough to the bottom of the screen, it will roll right onto the plate.

When a plate is full, Side Orders appear in the diner: if Peter picks them up, he earns 250 points and 1 pepper. When he fills 4 plates (finish four game screens), he enters the Blue Plate Special bonus round: Food Balls start raining across the screen and Peter can eat all them, but the flashing ones, for extra points.

With them he can squish the Rotten Food too, earning extra points. He can shake pepper to stop them momentarily or simply run away. If a Rotten Food touch him, he loses a turn. Peter can obtain a new turn every 20.000 points. If he run out of turns the game ends.</desc>

As Dracula bites his victims, his actions will call the attention of the local constable who will try to slow him down by driving a stake into him.  Dracula can respond by either turning one of his victims into zombies to attack the police, or by transforming into a bat to escape capture.  Even the forces of nature are against the vampire, as wolves will attack him on foot, and hawks will drag away his bat form.  Dracula must feed on a certain number of victims and return to his tomb before sunrise, or he will not survive to feed another night.</desc>

As Duncan skates he weakens the ice; if he skates completely around another penguin -- KER-PLASH! -- the ice collapses and the penguin falls into the pond. Duncan has only two worries -- the seal who loves to bounce him on her nose, and the lumbering polar bears who like to bat him around.

You control Duncan by pressing the hand controller DISC.  Skate around the other penguins, dunking them in the pond. Avoid or dunk the seal and polar bears. Gobble shrimp cocktails for extra speed. Dunk all of the penguins, then take the Zamboni ice resurfacer out for a spin to fix up the pond -- more penguins show up and the game continues at the next level, harder than before!</desc>

		<desc>Neptina, Neptune's daughter, has been imprisoned at the bottom of the sea by Titans. Your goal is to rescue her by locating the scattered pieces of a magical trident! You will need to take the form of a dolphin and a bird in order to locate the pieces that are hidden in the ocean and clouds. When flying in the air, there are several screens that have clouds flying by. Touch all of the clouds, and the trident piece appears! Other birds which are flying around will cause you to lose energy if you touch them accidentally. Underwater, trident pieces can be found by touching the sea horses. Octopuses, sharks, and a deadly maze of seaweed will get in your way and cause you to lose energy if caught! When you have located all of the trident pieces, the cage holding Neptina can be unlocked, but if you run out of energy first the game will be over.</desc>

		<desc>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<name>Happy Trails</name>
		<desc>Happy Trails is an action strategy game for one or two players. Black Bart has robbed the stagecoach, and you need to recover all of the stolen money within the given time limit! The money is located in various locations in a series of maze-like paths. The paths are broken up into tiles, and there is one tile missing so you can rearrange the maze by moving a tile into the empty space. As your character walks through the paths, you need to rearrange the tiles to make sure there is always a connected path in front of him (or you'll lose a life) and to guide him towards the money bags. When all of the money has been recovered, you move on to the next round. On the more difficult rounds, Black Bart will also be wandering around the maze trying to stop you! You should avoid him at all costs, unless you have first collected a star which gives your character temporary invincibility.</desc>

		<desc>Terrorist forces have taken over the island city of New Seeburg. They are equipped with heavily armed combat helicopters, so the only way to fight'em is in the air. The player drives the top secret JAF-3000 helicopter, and must blow up enemies with the laser cannons and put out fires with the water cannons. There is a radar screen too, that shows all the damages made by the terrorists, the fires extinguished and the enemies shut down.
The terrorists hits can damage the engine, the navigation system, the cannons and the radar. The player can return to home base (Force Island) for repairs and refuelling, but only two times per mission (the 3rd time after eliminating all the fiends). The game, for 1 player, ends if the copter crashes.</desc>

		<desc>2 children are trapped in a haunted house full of evil Thirsties! Guide the children through the house to find all of the ingredients for a batch of Kool-Aid!

The children initially move together through the house, but if one of the children is attacked by a roaming Thirsty, the children separate, and are now controlled one at a time. If a child is attacked twice, that child is out of the game. If both children are attacked twice, the game is over.

Once all ingredients for Kool-Aid (sugar, Kool-Aid, and a pitcher) are placed near the kitchen sink, Kool-Aid Man appears and is now controlled by the player! Use Kool-Aid Man to collect roaming fruit and to destroy the Thirsties. Once the Thirsties have been defeated, the round is over, and the game starts over with a higher difficulty level (unless "kiddy mode" was selected at game start-up.)

Kool-Aid Man is for 1 player, and offers 13 difficulty settings, including a children's mode which never increases in difficulty during gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Lady Bug</name>
		<desc>An action game in the same style as Pac-Man but very very different. Players control a ladybug who must venture around different mazes collecting all of the food pellet "x"'s. In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game.  In the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete "lap". Timers for the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.

In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that colour's word. The red word is "SPECIAL" and the yellow word is "EXTRA". Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.

Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.</desc>

		<desc>Land Battle is a two player war game which utilizes both strategic and tactical modes of play. Each player controls an array of forces with the objective of capturing or destroying his opponent's "flag."

The game can be played on any of thousands of different countryside maps -- the first thousand of which are selectable at the beginning of the game. All of these maps show roads, towns, hills, lakes, forests, orchards, and fields, and these geographic features impose restrictions and necessitate clever planning on the part of the player.</desc>

		<desc>Lock 'n' Chase is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. You play a thief who is trapped in a maze like vault. To get out, you need to collect all of the gold dots located in the maze. Your task won't be easy, since there are four police officers in the vault who are constantly trying to catch you! Located throughout the maze are numerous doors. As you run through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily close a door in an attempt to block the police. You can only close two doors at a time, and any closed doors automatically open again after a short amount of time. When all of the gold in the maze has been collected, the exit to the vault will open and you can escape and move on to the next, more difficult vault. Occasionally a bonus item will appear in the maze, such as a cash bag, crown, or briefcase, which can be collected to earn even more points.</desc>

		<name>Loco-motion</name>
		<desc>Based on a 1982 coin-op, Loco-Motion is a puzzle-style arcade game in which a train is riding on a grid of movable track pieces. The goal is to guide the train through the train stations located around the edge of the playfield. An empty section in the grid allows the player to shift adjacent track pieces into that section to alter the train's path, and a tracing light shows the path the train is taking as it moves. An accelerator button moves the train more quickly on its path, and a panic button will switch the piece of track the train is on with a random track piece on the grid.

A bonus timer ticks down during gameplay, showing how many points will be received if the train arrives at a station in a timely fashion. If the timer reaches zero, "Crazy Trains" and "Loop Sweepers" will appear and race down the track in an attempt to crash into your train. Other obstacles include "Crazy Tracks" which can send your train in another direction, and exploding stations (occurring occasionally if the bonus timer reaches zero.)

Loco-Motion has 4 play speeds, and offers play for 1 player or 2 players alternating turns.</desc>

In the first part of the game, you control the Wind Raider flying towards Castle Grayskull. You have a limited amount of fuel with which to reach your destination, plus numerous fireballs will be flying around the screen trying to stop you and Skeletor will be running along the ground. The Wind Raider is equipped with bombs and guns which can be used to defend yourself from the fireballs, and also can earn bonus points if you can hit Skeletor. The second part of the game takes place on foot. When you've landed near the castle, He-Man needs to pursue Skeletor. Skeletor will be firing numerous lightning bolts which can be blocked with a shield. There is a time limit here, and you must get past all of the screens and catch Skeletor before time runs out. If you are successful, the game will repeat at a tougher skill level.</desc>

		<desc>Nova Blast is a side-scrolling sci-fi shooter in which your must defend 4 shielded cities from invaders that attack from both in the air and on the ground. Each city has a bubble shield that can sustain one hit; another hit to an unshielded city will destroy it.

Players control a ship that can fire lasers horizontally and drop bomb vertically. The ship is also equipped with an energy beam that can absorb energy from energy tanks, and can also use that energy to create temporary shields around unprotected cities. The ship can also sustain up to 10 blows in each round. If all 4 cities are destroyed or the ship takes 10 hits in a round, the game ends.

Nova Blast is a single player game with 3 difficulty levels.</desc>

		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>

		<name>Reversi</name>
		<desc>Reversi is a computerized version of the board game Othello. During the game, two players take turns placing game pieces on the board in an attempt to trap pieces of their opponents color. Any trapped pieces will then be reversed in color. When the board becomes completely filled up, whomever has the most pieces of his own color on the board wins. The game can be played by two players, or one player against the computer. There are three skill levels the computer can use, and three different board sizes are available, 6 by 6, 8 by 8, and 10 by 10.</desc>

The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life.</desc>

		<desc>Safecracker puts you in the role of one of history's greatest spies as you drive around the streets of a foreign city and abscond with secretive cameras, keys, microfilm, flasks of chemicals, and bars of gold bullion.

While cruising around the city, you should avoid crashing into curbs or other cars. You can shoot the cars if you like, but this will bring the Secret Police and their bullets. You should make your way to one of the embassies, where you can learn the combination needed to open the treasury vault. This is also where you can find most of the secretive items. After picking the combination locks of four embassies, you will have both secret numbers needed to open the treasury safe, which contains the gold.

The most profitable way to crack a safe is to pick its combination numbers by finding the right number sequences. This involves cycling through various numbers (0 through 99) on your keypad. Pick numbers until there are no more to find. If you find yourself running out of time, you can simply blow up the safe with dynamite. However, you will not score any points, and the Secret Police will respond to an alarm that will automatically be set off.</desc>

You control Scooby as he chases ghosts through a maze while himself being chased by the skull &amp; crossbones.  If three ghosts are caught within a time-limit, the skull will disappear and a submarine sandwich appears. When eaten, it gives you a magic bone which when dropped in the path of the skull will momentarily freeze it in place.  When Scooby is caught by the skull, the difficulty will go down.  There's 10 mazes in all, but with the keyboard addon for Intellivision you can also make your own mazes.</desc>

		<name>Sewer Sam</name>
		<desc>It's a lovely day and Sam is waiting in Central Park to meet his girlfriend Sally. He sees her and walks to her. He only has eyes for her and before he realizes it he finds himself in the New York sewer system.

Three Russian submarines have been located in the New York sewer system and they have blocked off the system.
Sam's only way out of the sewer system is to destroy the Russian submarines. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.
Sam can't go back... once he's gone through the City Sewer Department seals the tunnel. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.

The sewer system has three types of sewer tunnels. Tunnels with solid dry floors, tunnels with a water passage in the middle and tunnels with pits. 
Sam can walk, run and creep through the tunnels but Sam can't move as quickly in water.
Sam can move from tunnel to tunnel by entering one of the passages that appear occasionally on his way.
Each time he enters a new sewer, Sam receives a fresh supply of oxygen.

On it's way through the sewer system Sam is under attack by nasties like rats, bats, spiders and more.
The ultimate nasties are the Russian submarines. They are located only in water canals. The status bar at the top of the screen contains a distance indicator. It tells you how far Sam has traveled into the sewer. If it's red, it means there's a dreaded submarine at the end of the sewer.
The more nasty elements you shoot, the higher you'll score.</desc>

Selecting from a pool of 70 players, each with statistics taken from the actual NBA (and attributed with 'fake' names so as to avoid licensing issues), each player must manage salaries to stay under the salary cap.

As player/owner, you run, pass, shoot, defend, and rebound. Keep an eye on your players - if they tire, they play more poorly. And keep an eye on the 24 second shot clock!</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Slap Shot - Super Pro Hockey (USA).int</path>
		<name>Slap Shot: Super Pro Hockey</name>
		<desc>Super Pro Hockey is a one or two-player hockey game.  There are four handicap/skill levels to choose from after selecting whether or not the player wants a one or two-player game: Amateur, Rookie, Pro, Super Pro.  Essentially, changing the handicap results in changing speeds to the gameplay, from low (Amateur) to high (Super Pro).  There are no teams, only Home and Visitor.  

Each team has three players and a goalie.  The home team is tan and the visitor team is green.  The player can only control one character at at time, and this character is colored lighter than the rest of the player's team.  Goalies are controlled by the computer.

The game also features a special slap shot button, a penalty box, face-offs, interceptions, and tripping.  

Tripping is considered a "legal" move if applied to the opponent character with the puck.  Penalties occur when a player trips an opponent character without a puck, and one player will be removed to the penalty box.  The team with the penalized player must now defend for a short time with one less man.  Supposedly, the computer "referee" will only call a penalty about one in three times tripping occurs.

Various stats are maintained at the top of the screen, including score, penalty time, remaining time and which period the game is currently in.  Periods are shown as bars on the screen rather than numbers--one for first, two for second, three for third.

The game has been criticized for essentially being little more than the original Intellivision NHL Hockey game with an added single player mode.</desc>

		<desc>Like the ancient Spartans that fought (and won) the Persian army in the battle of the Thermopylae, you are the last stand before the alien invasion. 

The game has two screens. When it begins, a female voice welcomes you as the commander of the star ship. You have three star bases to defend while alien ships surround you. Then you choose a space sector where you enter in to the battle section. 

Your ship has 5 systems (Battle Computer, Impulse Drive, Hyper Drive, Tracking Computer and Shields): if your  ship is hit you can repair the damage at a star base. Repairs during battles are allowed, but they are slower, use ship's energy and can't repair destroyed ship systems. The game ends when you run out of energy and/or your ship is destroyed. The ship is destroyed when all the systems are destroyed, or if Hyper Drive blows the ship up (50% chance of this occurring if you use Hyper Drive when destroyed).</desc>

As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!</desc>

		<name>Super Pro Football</name>
		<desc>Super Pro Football is a one or two-player football game.  There are only two teams, the Home Team and the Visiting Team (orange and blue respectively).  Quarterbacks are colored differently than the rest of the team--red and dark blue for the Home and Visiting teams.

After pressing Enter from the title screen, the player has the options of selecting if the players will be human or computer, and then their difficulty level, or rating--Rookie or Super Pro.  

Prior to playing the game, the player (or computer) can select from a wide list of options and planning strategies for playing the game.  

Options for the Defensive team include Formation, Tactic, Timeout, Stats, Controls, and Break.  "Break" exits the menu and begins gameplay.  "Stats" contains all the current information on the game including the timer, score, down, quarter, and time outs.  There are nine Formations to choose from, and four options under Tactics.  Formations can also be changed on the gameplay screen prior to the opponent team hiking the ball.  Controls are pretty basic, only really involving the control wheel.

The options for the Offensive team include Formation, Kick, Recover 1, Recover 2, Timeout, Stats, Controls, and Break.  A "program receiver" appears under the Recover options.  Like defense, there are nine formation options.  Controls are more involved in offensive play, including hiking, kicking, passing high or low, and running.

The game is seen from a top-down view and scrolls left-to-right to move with the gameplay.</desc>

You control Duncan by pressing the hand controller DISC.  Skate around the other penguins, dunking them in the pond. Avoid or dunk the seal and polar bears. Gobble shrimp cocktails for extra speed. Dunk all of the penguins, then take the Zamboni ice resurfacer out for a spin to fix up the pond -- more penguins show up and the game continues at the next level, harder than before!</desc>

		<name>Thunder Castle</name>
		<desc>In this medieval fantasy game, players take control of a brave knight as he sets out on a quest of treasure hunting and survival.  The quest takes the knight into three different realms of danger, each with its own challenges, and an ever changing maze of which they must navigate through.  The quest is broken down into these challenges:

Forest - The Knight must confront three dragons, each one more difficult than the last.  Along the way, an enchanted bat will give him the strength to overcome the danger.

Castle - The Knight must overcome six wizards, his only aid being a mouse that will generally try to avoid capture.

Dungeon - A randomly appearing skull is the only defense against the nine demons that make up the sinister dungeons.

Along the way, the items that the Knight will find may be of some help (or hinder) his quest to make it through the different areas.  Challenge the areas again and again for the highest score possible!</desc>

		<desc>Reaching high towards the heavens, the Tower of Doom stands, beckoning brave adventures to confront the bizarre creatures and brave the deadly traps it contains in hopes of collecting the bountiful treasures and magical items found within its corridors.

Tower of Doom is a single-player, Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired adventure title created exclusively for the Intellivision. Choose from 10 different character classes, each with its own strengths. 7 different quests are available for play, with the harder quests featuring randomized maps and magic item effects. After choosing the quest to embark on, players will then control their character using a top-down view of the section of the dungeon they are in, the corridors and rooms being drawn on-screen as they explore them. Also to the player's disposal is a display of the character's inventory which can be utilized at any time, and an on-screen map of the entire dungeon. Encountering a creature will initiate a battle screen at which time players can fight the creature or attempt to bribe it with items they have discovered. Magic items and traps can also be found in the dungeon, each having unique effects on the player.</desc>

Enemies will come at you three at a time, and will throw discs at you.  You must keep moving to avoid them while also firing discs right back at them.  There are different doors you can enter that will teleport you to another part of the room, giving you a chance to catch the enemies off guard.

There are two skill levels, and the higher your score, the harder the game becomes.  Do good, and your enemies will move faster, become more accurate, and the discs will go much faster.</desc>

The ultimate goal of Maze-A-Tron is to disable the MCP. Maze-A-Tron is played in rounds; Circuit Maze and the Master Control Program. You go around the maze and collect energy for your shields, which can be used to protect Flynn from some enemies. You also collect zeroes that are used to clear RAM. 

When you proceed to the Master Control Program, the MCP works to fix the RAM you cleared. Your goal here is to fire a Bit-Gun at pairs of BIT streams and BIT stacks before they hit the top of the screen.

These two phases repeat with a higher difficulty each time.</desc>

		<name>TRON: Solar Sailer</name>
		<desc>Take the role of Flynn in Tron: Solar Sailer, an Intellivoice game based on the movie Tron. Navigate your way through the computer world to find the MCP (Master Computer Program). Overload the MCP to escape the computer world and return to reality!

Tron: Solar Sailer is a 1-player game with 2 stages of gameplay. In stage one, the player is given an access code to write down, and then is to guide the solar sailer down tracks in the computer world with the goal of reaching Track 0, where the MCP is located. As the player traverses the tracks, tanks attempt to shoot the sailer and recognizers attempted to move the sailer farther away from Track 0. I/O beams teleport the player closer to the MCP if they can properly enter the access code given to them at the beginning of the game. Moving down a track and shooting at enemies depletes energy from the track; switching tracks restores energy to full. If energy fully depletes before the player switches tracks, the sailer stops moving and the game is over. Energy levels can be monitored by the amount of "energy bugs" on the grid surrounding the track, with more bugs meaning more track energy. An audible warning also announces when track energy is low.

If the player makes it to Track 0, stage two begins. The player is placed in the heart of the MCP as it attempts to make continuous data transmissions to keep the player from entering the override code, thereby overloading the MCP and allowing Flynn to escape the computer program. 0s and 1s fly at the player in a first-person view. An in-game voice gives the player the override code in binary, and the player uses a cursor to catch the appropriate bits. Using the number pad, the player can then specify where in the code sequence the captured bit should go. Red bits, when colliding with the cursor, automatically fill in a randomly selected part of the sequence. This area is timed, so the code must be entered as quickly as possible!

Once the correct sequence has been entered, the MCP overloads and the game is over. However, the game gives the option of going into "Overtime Mode" for extra points, at which point the player attempts to block all incoming transmissions or lose the game.</desc>

From time to time, Doris will drop a handkerchief; collect this and you become temporarily invincible! If you catch Doris, you then move on to the next section of the island; when each section of the island has been completed you then need to battle the Beach Bruiser on a bridge. If you're successful, the game will then repeat at a more difficult skill level.</desc>

		<desc>Venture is a conversion of the popular arcade game. You control Winky, the heroic adventurer. Your goal is to collect as many treasures as you can which are scattered throughout numerous dungeons. In each dungeon, there are several chambers which each contain a treasure. Armed only with your crossbow, you need to get past the varied creatures which guard the chamber, snag the treasure, and make it out again. When you collect the treasure from each of the chambers in a dungeon, you can then move on to the next, more difficult dungeon.</desc>

		<name>White Water!</name>
		<desc>In White Water! your goal is to raft down a river in the shortest time possible. The river features many dangerous turns, rocks, whirlpools, barrels, and other obstacles that get in your way. You begin your trip with three men, and if you don't navigate carefully they can fall out of the raft! If any men remain in the raft, they can try pick up anyone who has fallen out but must do so before they hit a rock, a whirlpool, or leave the screen (if all of your men fall out of the raft, the game will end). In the easier game variations, your score is based on how quickly you can reach the finish line. In the more difficult game variations, you not only need to reach the finish line as quickly as possible but also need to earn points by landing your raft at various beaches along the way and collecting treasures that can be found in the forest. Some of the treasures will be guarded by the natives, so be careful (also be sure not to wander too far into the forest, or you'll become lost). The game ends when you reach the finish line, or all your men are lost either by falling in the river or in the forest.</desc>

		<desc>Major League Baseball is an action baseball game for two players. The game follows most professional baseball rules and allows you to control all of the players on the team. You can throw a variety of pitches (from curve balls to fast balls), steal bases, tag players out, bunt, try for a home run, and in the event of a tie the game goes into extra innings! Several difficulty levels are available which control the game speed and whether or not stealing bases is allowed.</desc>

		<name>World Series Major League Baseball</name>
		<desc>World Series Major League Baseball is a baseball sports game that supports both ECS and Intellivoice (for play by play announcements). The game is based on real baseball player statistics (even though the names had been changed to fictional ones before the release) and offers baseball games using multiple cameras (including in-game split-screen), showing the game in a 3D display rather than side-scrolling fashion.

It supports two players simultaneously, where a center camera is used to show pitcher and batter. While one player chooses the pitch type, the batter decides when to swing or bunt. The screen then switches to an external camera view for the defending player to control the fielders, while the other player handles the baserunners. The games can be saved and loaded through the RAM chip on the cartridge.</desc>

		<desc>Felton Pinkerton wanted to take his wife to the fair, so he didn't get a chance to spray pesticide on his crop of corn. But due to his laziness, all of the bugs have now arrived and are trying to eat every last bit of corn! You control Felton who is armed with a spray gun. Your crop of corn is displayed on the left side of the screen, and you need to protect it from the incoming hoard of inchworms, moths, caterpillars, slugs, and other assorted bugs which approach rapidly from the right. If any of the bugs sneak past you, they will eat part of your corn crop. The game ends when all of the corn has been eaten. On each level you need to spray all of the bugs that appear in order to move on to the next round; as the rounds progress, the bugs become faster, more numerous, and home in quicker on the corn.</desc>

Yogi needs to learn a lesson so Ranger Smith decides to put Yogi to work in the apple fields. His job is to fill up the cart and take the filled cart back to camp.
Being smarter than the average bear, Yogi concocts a conveyor belt that carries the apples down the hill.
Someone is out to get Yogi though and attempts to sabotage him by taking his basket away preventing him from send enough apples to the cart.
To make sure they succeed, they also clog the conveyor belt with a contraption that knocks the apples off the conveyor belt.
It is a good thing Yogi has a trusted and reliable friend.
Boo Boo is tasked with returning Yogi's baskets to him and stopping the contraption that knocks the apples off the conveyor belt.</desc>

The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

		<desc>Math fun is an educational game which can be played by one or two players. Each player controls a gorilla which is wandering through the jungle. As the gorilla walks on, it will encounter a creature which has a math problem with it. You need to enter in the correct answer to the problem as quickly as possible. If you get the answer correct, your gorilla may continue on. If you get the answer wrong, then your gorilla must jump into the river. Your gorilla is unable to leave the river and continue on until you answer another math problem correctly. The goal is to correctly answer as many of the problems as you can in the shortest amount of time. The game includes eighteen different levels of difficulty which can be set individually for each player.</desc>

		<name>Lock 'n' Chase</name>
		<desc>Lock 'n' Chase is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. You play a thief who is trapped in a maze like vault. To get out, you need to collect all of the gold dots located in the maze. Your task won't be easy, since there are four police officers in the vault who are constantly trying to catch you! Located throughout the maze are numerous doors. As you run through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily close a door in an attempt to block the police. You can only close two doors at a time, and any closed doors automatically open again after a short amount of time. When all of the gold in the maze has been collected, the exit to the vault will open and you can escape and move on to the next, more difficult vault. Occasionally a bonus item will appear in the maze, such as a cash bag, crown, or briefcase, which can be collected to earn even more points.</desc>
