		<name>Dot Hack G.U. Vol. 1 : Rebirth</name>
		<desc>.hack//G.U. takes place in an alternate version of Earth in the year 2017. As depicted in the first .hack game series, the "2nd Network Crisis" was an incident that occurred seven years ago in which many computer systems across Japan malfunctioned. Through the efforts of those games' hero, Kite, the incident resulted in the birth of Aura, the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), capable of making decisions for itself. Under the guidance of Aura, The World, the most popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game at the time, flourishes and the events of .hack//Legend of the Twilight occur during this four-year period</desc>

		<name>Dot Hack G.U. Vol. 2 : Reminisce</name>
		<desc>The second release in a series of three, .hack//G.U.: Vol. 2 -- Reminisce takes place in a fictional MMO environment called The World. As in previous releases of .hack, The World features elements of online gaming without the actual connection. Gamers interact with people they might find in a real MMO, take on quests, and adventure across a large environment as they increase their level. 

In this version of The World, gamers find the once-utopian landscape is now a player killer's (PKers) heaven. A bug in the game is blocking the log-off ability to all fictional gamers; effectively locking them into The World. Now, bands of PKers prey on every character in their path hoping that the slaughter knocks them out of the game and back into real life. 

Gamers take the role of Haseo, a killer of players who is stuck in the game. Haseo must work his way through The World by interacting with other character, defeating enemies in dungeon sprawls, and by completing assigned objectives. Navigation through the game requires the use of Warp points located around the map.</desc>

		<name>Dot Hack G.U. Vol. 3 : Redemption</name>
		<desc>It is 2017 and the dangers found in .hack//G.U.: Vol. 3 Redemption are filtering out of the game. The evil entity terrorizing players in "The World" is free and wreaking havoc in real-life. Players once again take the role of Haseo, a young adventurer who is the only hope for restoring peace in "The World." 

Gamers lead Haseo through many recognizable environments and into such new root towns as Breg Epona and the Net Slum. The steam bike makes a return and players can now upgrade their bikes and speed through five riding missions. Toward the end of the game, players may access a 100 floor dungeon and work through each level with their most powerful party members. 

Haseo has earned a few upgrades via a mysterious hacker who broke into his account and added a new set of powers. These powers, called the "Xth" form, allow Haseo to use a pair of pistols with blades on the barrel. With these weapons Haseo can deal greater damage and perform a "double trigger" attack by invoking a special ability. 

The level cap is increased to 150, and gamers can add up to 22 additional avatars to their party. In the heat of battle, if players find themselves at the losing end, they can access the "avatar awakening" power and drain the virus cores from the enemy. Additionally, there are new cards for the "Crimson Versus" game and a new arena battle.</desc>

You can get member addresses of other character and attempt to call them to in game to see if they are on-line to join you in a quest. Like standard MMORPG games, it has many side quests, lots of weapons and armor, a trading system for equipment among other character and the ability to move between different servers. You also have message boards and e-mail to communicate with other "players". The second chapter offers better AI control of other character's, additional items, more characters, access to more servers / areas, and a few other features. Characters from the previous game can be imported, and current characters can be saved for use in future installments.

The story continues after the events of the first game. Kite's friend is still in a coma and he still hasn't found out why. The story deepens as the hacker Helba and the game administrators both start getting involved with Kite. The admins are not happy with him but can use his help to investigate what is going on. The question on what happened to Aura at the end of the first game still gets deeper and new elements concerning the beta version of ?The World? (originally called "Fragments") are resurfacing.</desc>

Some player characters in The World are mysteriously falling comatose - your main character Kite has to investigate the matter, aided by companions he meets on his trip through the virtual world.

Like the first two hack games, this is an action RPG - essentially a dungeon crawler. You can pause at any time during the battle to issue commands (such as using items). In "Outbreak", you and your opponents start at around level 50 and can reach level 70. You can also import a saved game from the previous game, .hack//MUTATION.</desc>

		<desc>Tenkaichi 2 is a fighting game with more than 120 playable characters, the biggest amount ever featured in a Dragon Ball game. The main Dragon Adventure mode follows an epic story mode that covers the first Dragon Ball Z saga (Saiyan Saga) right up to the last Dragon Ball GT saga (Dragon Saga), including all of the major battles, making it one of the most comprehensive Dragon Ball Z games.

The same battle format from the predecessor is taken, but extended with improved mechanics, including the return of the "Planet Freedom" feature (last seen in Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3). There are more combat combos and in-battle transformations, all topped of with a featured encyclopedia, which covers all the most important aspects of the Dragon Ball universe.

All the characters from the previous version are present, with some new ones (there are more in the Wii version), and up to ten characters can participate in a single battle, with a tag system. The locations include those of the previous game, with some additional ones.</desc>

		<desc>After the dragon rider Rynn returns to her home village, she finds it destroyed, and all its inhabitants massacred. Her dragon, Arokh, tells her that he hears a voice that calls them to the city of Surdana. There, they find out that race of three-faced monsters, called Desert Lords, have been terrorizing the human population recently. In order to fight them, the humans need powerful allies. But the gateway to the world of dragons has been sealed, and only a dragon of the Elder Breed can open it. Rynn and Arokh must now venture to the dragon world, restore the bond between humans and dragons, and defeat the Desert Lords.

Drakan: The Ancients' Gates is an action game with RPG elements. The player will take control of both Rynn and Arokh during the course of the game. Arokh's gameplay involves flying to distant lands and dealing with some of the more powerful foes. Rynn's gameplay has more RPG elements, as she can specialize in the arts of melee fighting, archery, or magic, acquiring experience from defeated enemies.</desc>

		<name>Drakengard</name>
		<desc>Drakengard follows the story of a kingdomless prince named Caim who fights for the Union against the Empire. Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...

The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.

Levels that have been visited before might become "Expedition Missions" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard.</desc>

Drakengard 2 (known as Drag On Dragoon in Japan) takes place 18 years after the events of the original. The whereabouts of the original's hero, Caim, are unknown to anyone. A new young knight called Nowe serves as the playable main character. Together with his dragon, Legna, Nowe takes part in land and air-based battles, just like in the original, albeit with more refined gameplay. The kill-all mechanics and upgradable weapons of the original return with this title, with the promise of faster action. While on the ground, the game now lets you change freely between characters, with no limit. You'll want to switch characters in order to best match the enemy at hand. Other additions include new mega attacks while airborne.</desc>

		<desc>DT Racer is an arcade and simulation racer featuring 21 facsimiles of real race cars. Players can select from Arcade, GT, and Free modes. In Arcade the player progresses through increasingly more difficult grand prix to unlock more powerful tiers of cars. In GT mode players are awarded credits for finishing races that they can buy new cars with, and higher level races require higher tier cars to be played. Courses range from ovals to city courses, and include facsimiles of real tracks such as the Circuit de Monaco.

Before a race the tires, downforce, and suspension of a car can be modified. During a race cars take damage from impacts, causing parts to break and fall off the car. This damage will also hinder a car's performance.</desc>

		<desc>A third-person action RPG, Dual Hearts tells the tale of Rumble and Tumble, an unlikely pairing of a young adventurer and a mythical creature known as a baku. While on a quest to retrieve the legendary Dream Stone, Rumble encounters Tumble, who is in fact on a quest of his very own. As ordered by the Queen of the Dreamworld, Tumble must safeguard nine ancient keys, whose combined powers ensure that nightmares remain sealed within the Temple of Dreams. The hapless creature loses the keys and the only way to recover them is to invade the dreams of people in the real world. Thus, the duo must seek out those whom they suspect have inadvertently become hosts to each key. While wondering around Sonno Island, players are free to speak to its many denizens or acquire items that will prove useful on their journey. As players wander about the island, time will slowly pass, changing from day to night and back again.</desc>

		<desc>About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.
 They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.
 Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win.</desc>

The heart of the game, campaign mode, begins by choosing any of 24 regions and 42 rulers (custom characters can be created). Beginning with a small kingdom, the ultimate goal is the conquering of all others. Each turn, the player is given a choice from 4 different governing options (brought to your attention by your generals) followed by a single decision of action. These actions typically include the invasion or defense of a specific province or the option to aid an allied empire with those same actions.</desc>

		<desc>Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends is a minor expansion to Dynasty Warriors 5. This game was released on November 16, 2005 and is playable only on the PlayStation 2 video game console.

Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends does not allow the player to play Musou Mode or Free Mode if the player does not possess the original Dynasty Warriors 5 game disk. New game modes included Destiny Mode, Xtreme Mode, and Legend Mode.

Xtreme Mode is a parallel to Shura Mode in Dynasty Warriors 5 Special, in which the objective of the game is for the human-controlled character to survive as long as possible while collecting gold dropped by enemies to regain health and increase stats temporarily.

In Destiny Mode, the player is first allowed to customize a character. After creating a personalized character, a player will be asked to join the Kingdom of Shu, Wei and Wu. While in this mode, you will be playing as a character with very few attacks (starting off with only 2 fundamental hits) and will be "protected" by a chosen officer near the character. The officer will heal the character continuously when injured during battle, so long as the character is nearby. A unique feature of Destiny Mode is that at times the player is given the option to betray one force, while setting a ruse for another. For example, a player receives a letter from Cao Cao, the King of Wei, in which he asks the player to defect from the Kingdom of Wu to the Kingdom of Wei. If the player defers the offer to switch sides their commander may approach them in the hopes of creating a ruse to destroy the opposing force. If the player chooses to accept the option from their commander they will fight for the other side temporarily. When the time is right their original commander will have them move the opposing commander to a set position which will trigger their ruse and supporting units will ambush the opposing commander to support the player's defection.</desc>

		<desc>Veteran publisher Koei draws more inspiration from Chinese literature's Romance of the Three Kingdoms for its sixth installment of Dynasty Warriors. As with previous titles in the action-oriented series, players choose from a variety of stout heroes and noble warriors before engaging in historically inspired battles featuring hundreds of combatants. While the series has been criticized for its lack of significant changes from release to release, Dynasty Warriors 6 adds a number of enhancements to the well-traveled franchise. Though it lacks the graphical flourishes of the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, the PS2 edition of Dynasty Warriors 6 offers ten new scenarios, five additional stages, and host of new weapons. The emphasis is still on defeating throngs of enemies with swords, giant hammers, polearms, and other weapons, with lengthy combo chains possible by varying attacks.

As players become more skilled in combat, they can choose from a variety of skills to customize their heroes as they see fit. A new "renbu" system allows characters to earn immediate combat bonuses through dexterous play, but these bonuses are lost once the battle is over. Characters also have the ability to swim across water and scale walls to perform surprise attacks on enemy camps. Another change is the omission of bodyguards, so players must go it alone instead of having a personal entourage. In their place is a faithful steed that can be called upon in a pinch to make hasty retreats or to charge at full gallop into groups. The character's horse will also level up along with characters, improving attributes in speed or power in combat. Featured game types include Musou Mode, a character-specific campaign, Challenge Mode, offering specific goals to complete, and Free, which involves building a character's stats on any unlocked battlefield. Players can also team-up with a friend via split-screen display.</desc>

		<desc>The story begins with Niobe, captain of the Logos, and Ghost, her first mate, retrieving a package left in the Matrix by the crew of the recently destroyed rebel ship Osiris. After being pursued by Agents, Ghost and Niobe escape from the Matrix with the package.

The package is a message to the human city Zion, warning them that the machines are tunneling to Zion with an army of Sentinels. Niobe and Ghost are tasked with calling the rest of the ships back to Zion to coordinate a defense. During this operation, Niobe and Ghost provide backup to another group of operatives trying to escape.

With everyone home, the captains of the various ships hold a meeting in the Matrix to decide on how best to defend themselves. During the meeting, Agents attack the building they are in. Niobe and Ghost help the humans escape; when everyone is safe except them, the Keymaker, a program capable of accessing any area in the Matrix, leads them to safety through a door that he created.

The Keymaker gives the two a key that they are supposed to give to Neo, the protagonist of the film trilogy. However, the key is stolen by henchmen of the Merovingian, a program created during the early days of the Matrix who now is a crime boss in the Matrix. As Niobe and Ghost pursue them, the character that the player did not choose is captured by more henchmen. Before the player character rescues the one captured, the Merovingian destroys the key that the Keymaker gave them. They then escape from the Matrix.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, the player controls Mouse, a silent musician who travels with his talking guitar Pattimo. One day Mouse is invited to play at a royal wedding on an island called Pandule. But soon he discovers that the groom Xelpherpolis has put an awful time-looping spell on the island, and intends to destroy this way the entire population. Mouse has to stop the villain and, most importantly, recruit other people to help him break the spell.

Ephemeral Fantasia is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat. Several characters can be recruited to the party. The game's stand-out feature is the time-looping system, which is somewhat similar to the one implemented in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The game has an internal clock, and the first five days repeat themselves until Mouse finds a way to stop it. Certain events occur only if Mouse travels to a specific location at a specific time.</desc>

		<desc>Guybrush Threepwood has finally defeated the zombie pirate LeChuck, and married his sweetheart Elaine Marley. The happy couple is returning home from an exciting honeymoon. But as they arrive on Melee Island, they notice some very strange changes. A mysterious stranger who calls himself Charles L. Charles is organizing a campaign to become the next governor. The Australian businessman Ozzie Mandrill is turning the Caribbean into an attraction for tourists. And on top of that, Elaine's mansion is being demolished! Naturally, it's up to our hero to revert the things back to normal, even if that means traveling to exotic islands and solving puzzles on the way.

Escape From Monkey Island is a direct sequel to The Curse of Monkey island, and is the fourth game in the Monkey Island series. The gameplay relies mainly on inventory-based puzzles and branching dialogues, just like in the previous installments. The interface is similar to that of Grim Fandango: mouse is not used, and the interaction is done via context-sensitive commands that appear on the screen whenever you navigate Guybrush close to an object. The game utilizes pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D character models.</desc>

To start off, the ESPN presentation has been greatly expanded. Chris Berman, who did voiceover for the half-time show in 2K4, returns for this season. Instead of just voice, there is a virtual Chris Berman, who does an introduction to each game, a half-time report, and a post-game show. To illiustrate certain points, he uses replays from each game.</desc>

		<desc>ESPN NHL 2K5 is the second hockey game using Sega's partnership with the worldwide leader in sports, ESPN.

As with any sports game, you get the standard game modes. 2K5 has a vastly improved Franchise mode over last year's game. In addition to the e-mail system that was introduced, you have the ability to hire several coaches. You can choose a head coach, offensive coach, defense coach, scouting coach, a goaltending coach and more. When it comes time to hire and fire players, you use actual money, and not points to negotiate contracts.

There are a few special game modes as well. You have access to the skills mode, which was also found in last year's game. You can choose accuracy shooting, puck control, hardest shot, fastest skater, and a few more. There is also a Party Mode, which is set up for one to four players (you and friends or you and the computer), which pits you in fast action games. An example is a free-for-all, where you have to get the puck and score it in the net while the constantly moving cinder wall, which blocks the net, is down.</desc>

ESPN NHL Hockey adds a revamped franchise mode. This year's franchise mode includes an e-mail system that sends you notices about team injuries, current playoff statuses, and trade deadlines. Even simple words of encouragement are emailed from the team owner.</desc>

		<desc>Evergrace is very basic, Japanese action RPG. As usual, player controls a young hero who eventually will save the world from the clutches of evil. The story takes two roads of two different heroes who run around fields killing monsters in real time action a bit like in Zelda games. The hook in this game, or not so much of a hook, but the thing that separates it from most of other RPG is that the characters don't level up. The power of character is measured by his equipment so when you get a better sword, you kinda level up that way. The weapons and equipment are also customizable so if you like playing with your tools, this is the game for you. This was the first RPG to appear on PS2 in Europe.</desc>

		<desc>Ash is back, baby, and more bitter than ever in THQ's follow-up to Evil Dead: Hail to the King. The city of Dearborn, MI, has been infested with Deadites and there's only one man alive who can clean them out. As the one-handed Ash, players can whack enemies with a shovel, shred them with a Gatling gun, rip into their bodies with a chainsaw, and make them chew lead with the boomstick, a 12-gauge double-barreled shotgun. Played from a third-person perspective, the game lets players use two weapons at once and features the wisecracking voice of Ash himself, Bruce Campbell.
 Up to 50 enemies can appear on the screen at any given time, but Ash can call upon the Book of the Dead's dark magic whenever he's in a pinch. Magic is replenished by collecting the souls of Deadites, and spells are acquired by finding scrolls hidden throughout each stage. Levels also feature multiple objectives that could involve locating more weapons, meeting with a certain character, or finding a way inside a specific building. Items such as keys to buildings, health packs, and other tools needed to advance are automatically stored in inventory.</desc>

		<name>Evil Dead : Regeneration</name>
		<desc>Based on Sam Raimi's classically campy series of horror films that began with 1983's The Evil Dead, this action game follows the continuing, cursed adventures of Ashley J. "Ash" Williams. Ash was recently sentenced to the Sunny Meadows Institute for the Criminally Insane, after being falsely convicted of murdering his camping companions. When Ash's psychiatrist begins tampering with the Necronomicon -- an evil book of ancient magic that has been the recurring source of Ash's supernatural troubles -- all hell breaks loose (quite literally).
 Once again, Ash is voiced by Bruce Campbell, who portrays the luckless hero in the films and previous Evil Dead games. Evil Dead: Regeneration plays like a combat adventure, in the fast-paced, fixed-camera style of the Devil May Cry or Onimusha games. Ash uses his "boomstick" shotgun and chainsaw prosthesis to blast and hack his way through nearly endless throngs of "deadites." Unlike earlier games based on the franchise, Evil Dead: Regeneration was developed by Cranky Pants Games, whose previous work includes the GameCube port of Volition's Red Faction II.</desc>

It consists of several popular skateboarders, such as Rick McCrank, Arto Saari, Kerry Getz, and Danny Way. There is also a create-a-skater feature and an unlockable character for every skater the player completes the game as. There are also sets of level specific songs such as the metal-remix of the Metal Gear Solid theme and a Castlevania theme after unlocking the Vampire Hunter. Levels are unlocked by beating a certain amount of objectives in a current level, such as collecting items like boots and other objects, performing tricks in certain areas of a level, and the occasional grinding a certain amount of meters. The Evolution Skateboarding engine was used in the bonus skateboarding mode included in the PlayStation 2 version of Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance.</desc>

		<desc>Seth McFarlane's dysfunctional Griffin family makes its video game debut as a third-person action title starring Peter, Stewie, and Brian in their own storylines rife with pop-culture jabs. As boorish blockhead Peter Griffin, players must stop English butler Mr. Belvedere's apparent bid for world domination. Wrathful wunderkind Stewie Griffin battles his "sperm brother" Bertram, while cultivated canine Brian Griffin figures a way out of prison.
 The game features a cel-shaded look to keep it in line with the animated series, and players will visit a number of familiar locales in and around the fictitious setting of Quahog, Rhode Island. Expect characters such as Death, Glen Quagmire, Cleveland Brown, and Joe Swanson to make comical cameos throughout the "giggity giggity" game.
 The Griffin family from Fox's animated TV series makes its way to video gaming for the first time.</desc>

		<desc>This fireworks-based puzzle title is notable for being the only title available from Sony on the PlayStation 2's launch date. In a manner similar to Missile Command, the goal is to select and detonate matched groups of flares. Using the analog stick to point from flare to flare, a player must link three or more similar flares and set them off in a chain of fireworks explosions. The bigger the chain, the higher your score.
 Each level has a predetermined length and a set course, scrolling through cities, outer space, and unknown territories. With a limited amount of energy, players stay alive by detonating as many flares as possible, and by grabbing various power-ups as they appear onscreen. Collecting enough "star" power-ups releases a "Starmine" flare -- a sort of bonus round, rapid-fire succession of flares.
 Upon successfully completing a level, you can watch a replay using various camera angles and add different lighting and weather effects. You can also store your best rounds on a memory card and show your fireworks displays off to your friends. Skilled players will be able to unlock a few extra options once they complete the regular game, including a Master Chain mode.</desc>

		<desc>Miku Hinasaki is young girl with a strange sixth sense. Her brother, Mafuyu, and his mentor, Junsei Takamine, went to investigate a mansion that once was inhabited by a powerful landowner who had absolute control over the area. Unfortunately, they never returned from their investigation. Miku enters the mansion, armed with only an antique camera given to her by her deceased mother, to try to find her brother.

While inside the mansion, Miku will encounter ghosts and other spiritual apparitions. In order to overcome these spirits and survive, she must use the magical camera to capture the ghosts on film, thereby trapping them forever. Ghosts range from invisible fragments hidden in scenery, to memories of the past that appear only for a moment before vanishing, to full body apparitions that will attempt to attack and kill Miku.

In order to defeat an aggressive ghost the Camera Obscura's shot must first be "charged" by keeping the ghost centered while it is visible. If Miku snaps a shot while the ghost is attacking or is vulnerable then she will drain even more energy from it, resulting in more spirit points being earned. Points can then be spent to improve her camera's attributes or give it special abilities, like slowing a ghost or pushing it away. The Camera Obscura can also reveal clues and dispel illusions, which Miku will need to utilize to solve puzzles within the mansion.</desc>

By chance Mio finds the Camera Obscura, and with its powers she searches for a way out get her sister and herself out of the village.

The camera no longer has to charge up a shot, but different film types now have loading times that can leave leave Mio defenseless if she takes a picture at a bad time. Special abilities for the camera no longer require a disposable item, and are instead charged by taking good shots of attacking ghosts. The stats of the camera and special abilities are still upgraded/unlocked with spirit points, but an item must first be found and spent as well to upgrade each level of a stat.

The Xbox release of Fatal Frame II includes an additional difficulty level, an additional ending, several extra unlockable cosmetic accessories, six additional unlockable pairs of costumes for Mio and Mayu, an unlockable survival mode with an additional ghost type, and an optional first person control/view style.</desc>

However, continuing with the improvements seen in previous games, the developers tweaked the game further, such as adding a new physics model, which brings more realism to collisions, but also increased responsiveness and goalkeeper AI and animations.

Featuring thirty leagues and passing the half-thousand team mark, the game includes the usual modes seen in previous games, with enhancements to the Be a Pro mode, now allowing up to 20 people on 20 different consoles to connect by the Internet and join a 10 vs. single match.
There's also a new paid premium mode, named «Adidas Live Season», which tracks the real results of six of the biggest leagues (Barclay?s Premier League, La Liga BBVA, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Serie A and Mexican Primera Division) to dynamically update players statistics up-to-the-week according to their form and performances.
A new online mode, FIFA 09 Clubs*, reserved to PS3 and X360 users, enables gamers to form or join user-controlled football teams of up to 50 friends and field their strongest team when competing in Be A Pro. As FIFA 09 Clubs* will determine the best virtual team in the world teams will be relegated or achieve promotion to different divisions depending on their results.</desc>

		<name>Fight Club</name>
		<desc>Fight Club is based on David Fincher's film adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. Fed up with consumerist American culture, a fight club is founded as a new type of therapy through bare-knuckle fighting. The game focuses on the fights and uses many characters and environments from the original story. You can create a new fighter or clone one of the generated characters. There are three general fighting styles to choose from: grappling, kung fu or brawling. The moves range from basic punches to devastating moves with broken bones, ripped clothes and real-time facial deformation. After each successful fight, you earn Character Development Points (CDP's) which can be used to upgrade or heal your character.

Aside from the regular arcade, survival and training mode, there is a story mode in which you need to work your way up as a rookie to become a key player in Project Mayhem in a storyline very loosely based on the original plot. Both the PS2 and Xbox version have an online multiplayer mode as well.</desc>

		<name>Fight Night Round 2</name>
		<desc>EA's Fight Night returns in its second installment. Once again, you can create a new boxer and start a career that begins as an amateur in a shady gym somewhere in Queens, NY and fight your way up to the top. Alternatively, you could relive the careers of some legendary boxers.

Of course, you could go for a simple match with either a computer or a live opponent.

Round 2 offers many new features, like fancy particle effects that show blood and sweat spraying into the camera in ultra slow-motion. The "Total Boxer Control", which lets you throw punches by making certain movements with the analog stick, has been improved. There are also many ways to customize the appearance of your character, up to the shaping of the cranium and ears.

The soundtrack consists of a dozen contemporary (but unfortunately edited) hip-hop tracks.</desc>

		<desc>EA Sports' Fight Night Round 3 from EA Chicago lets you make your own fighter, train them up, and literally take on the world. 

Start by creating your own champ and customizing how they look, what equipment they have, their fighting style, their weight class, their signature move, and even their own illegal hit. Get equipment and trainers for your fighter to enhance his look and performance.

Then take your fighter to career mode where you'll play fight your way up from the local gym all the way up to five-star venues. Get trainers to enhance your training and boost your speed and power. Play against randomly generated fighters all the way up through the ranks till you beat them in points or to a pulp. Certain fights may get you a bit of extra money as an incentive, or give you a promotional deal, but pick your fights carefully because strategy inside the ring won't matter if you mismanage your fisher outside.

Fight smart during the fight by using the total punch control system to throw the punches you want to by using the analog stick. The total punch control system maps your fists to the analog stick getting rid of the need for senseless button mashing.

You can also play in historical fights like Taylor vs. Hopkins, Gatti vs. Ward, or Robinson vs. Lamotta in the ESPN Classic mode to play in the fights that made boxing history.

Once you've got the computer down for the count, you can play with any fighter or user created fighters or any of the ESPN Classic fights in local multiplayer with a friend. You can also take the fight online and prove your the real champion of the world against any opponent anytime, anywhere.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy X</name>
		<desc>Square's acclaimed role-playing series makes its PlayStation 2 debut with Final Fantasy X. Players assume the role of Tidus, an athletic teenager who witnessed the destruction of his home city by an evil entity named Sin. While his life was spared, Tidus' contact with Sin opened a portal through time. Some 1,000 years have passed since the encounter, and Tidus now finds himself in a strange land with unfamiliar faces. As Tidus struggles to find a way back home, he will meet a variety of characters, including Yuna, a girl faced with the daunting task of defeating Sin.
 Final Fantasy X features a number of new features over previous installments. Backgrounds and characters are rendered entirely in 3D, with real-time facial expressions visible on each character. When characters are surprised, for example, they will raise their eyebrows or open their mouths in astonishment. For the first time in the series, dialogue has been recorded using professional voice actors. The U.S. version features voices in English, with optional English subtitles selectable from the menu screen.</desc>

		<desc>The game's story follows the character Yuna from Final Fantasy X as she seeks to resolve political conflicts in the fictional world of Spira before it leads to war.

The story begins as Yuna, Rikku and Paine recover Yuna's stolen Garment Grid from the Leblanc Syndicate in the first of several encounters in which they vie for spheres. The game is punctuated by a narration of Yuna addressing Tidus, as though she is recounting the events of the game to him as they occur in a style reminiscent of Tidus' own narration in Final Fantasy X. Although Yuna's quest is to find clues that may lead her to Tidus, much of the storyline of the game follows the clash of the factions that have established themselves in the time since the coming of the Eternal Calm in Final Fantasy X, and the uncovering of hidden legacies from Spira's ancient history. A significant portion of the game's events are unnecessary for the completion of the main storyline, but much of the depth of the story?including characterization and background details?are featured in the optional content, which generally follows how each part of Spira is healing in the time since the passing of Sin.</desc>

		<name>Finny the Fish &amp; the Seven Waters</name>
		<desc>In this underwater action-adventure, players take the role of the title character: a small, freshwater fish who finds himself in a (number of) big ponds (not to mention streams, lakes, and rivers). At the beginning of the game, Finny learns from a wizened old turtle that a great destiny lays before him, and that he must leave the safety of his home and travel the wide waters to find it. With representations of over 100 different species of underwater life, the game is full of small bugs and fish for Finny to eat, and large fish and animals that are interested in eating Finny. Unpredictable currents, hidden bonus areas, and (especially) fisherman's lures all pose additional challenges the small fry protagonist must face.
 In essence, the game is something of an arcade-style "fish sim," with believable underwater environments to explore and many action-oriented puzzles to solve. Some gameplay elements may be reminiscent of the later, 3D incarnations of Ecco the Dolphin, but Finny's adventures are presented in a slightly more "anime" (if not anthropomorphized) style. Originally known as Uo the Fish: The Seven Waters and the Gods, the North American release of Finny the Fish is the result of an unusual collaboration between eccentric publisher Natsume, the Sega staple design studio WOW Entertainment, and the PS2's own home team, Sony Computer Entertainment of Japan.</desc>

		<name>Fire Pro Wrestling Returns</name>
		<desc>Fire ProWrestling Returns is a 2D-graphic based wrestling simulation game. The game has a north-south/east-west-axis movement system. This allows for dual-plane movement rendering it to play like a 3D wrestling game (although the moves are still done in 2D).

The game features 327 wrestlers on the main roster, from over 10 major Japanese wrestling and mixed-martial arts organizations. This in-depth roster allows the player to simulate classic matches or matches that could never take place.

Game modes include a standard exhibition match, tag team exhibition match with 2, 3 or 4 player teams, a round robin league tournament featuring up to 64 wrestlers, a sudden elimination tournament featuring up to 16 wrestlers, mixed martial arts matches aka Ultimate Fighting (with either Pride or K*1 Rules), battle royal matches with up to eight players in the ring at the same time, 5-man team elimination matches and for the first time ever in a Fire ProWrestling game, a North American cage match mode.

The edit mode allows you to create wrestlers, referees and even entire wrestling organizations (with their own ring and logo). This mode features over 1,648 moves and holds you can assign to your wrestlers, and you can then tweak their CPU logic, so as to make them behave as you like when controlled by the computer.

The new features for the Fire ProWrestling series debuting in Fire ProWrestling Returns are North American cage matches, face layering on edit mode, and ring seconds (aka managers) that accompany wrestlers to the ring. It also features over 20 brand new moves, including some reanimations of old moves.</desc>

		<name>FlatOut</name>
		<desc>Blending high-speed races and dynamic crashes along with a cinematic storyline, FlatOut comes to the PS2 with a number of features designed to set it apart from previous racing titles. Players can leave their car before entering a race to check out the competition at the pit areas, glean some information at the local bar, perform tune-ups, and embark on brief missions to further the story. The heart of the game is the racing competition, where players hit the pedal to the metal on a variety of outdoor venues. The environment is also interactive, to the point where cars can smash through wooden barriers, send piles of stacked tires bouncing along the road, and knock orange cones flying into the distance. A number of jumps are also available, to catch some air.
 Real-time damage modeling is another highlight in FlatOut, with details such as engines, transmissions, and the driver viewable after smashing, crashing, and bashing into rival vehicles. Each part is designed to dent, crumple, crack, or fly off, and parts hurtling through the air can damage other vehicles as well.</desc>

		<name>Ford Bold Moves Street Racing</name>
		<desc>Ford Bold Moves Street Racing is the third Razorworks-developed title in the licensed Ford Racing series since they took over development in Ford Racing 2. Unlike its predecessors, this version has an urban atmosphere. The road races, off-road challenges and circuit tracks have been removed and the action has been taken entirely to the streets of Los Angeles, with 24 tracks available. As in the previous version, the 18 available cars are all Fords, ranging from the 1968 Mustang GT to the 2007 Shelby GT 500.

There are 4 main modes: Quick Race, Team Racing, Solo Racing and Multiplayer. Solo Racing offers quick races, and championships where new vehicles and tracks can be unlocked. The real novelty is the Team Racing mode, split up in single races, team championships, challenges and tutorials. Team Racing has the player control two or three vehicles in a single team during a race in modes such as Race, Elimination or Duel. The team with the highest point total wins, so the player either has to switch between the vehicles to drive (the others cars then become AI-controlled) or issue orders such as Block (slow down another vehicle) or Draft (additional speed in the slipstream) to influence the driving behaviour of the team mates. This can be extended to double or even triple actions of the same effect. Blocked cars have to brake and weave across the track until they regain control.</desc>

		<desc>Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror (released as America's 10 Most Wanted in Europe), is a first-person shooter game for the PlayStation 2 and PC. Developed by Black Ops Entertainment and released in 2004, it was critically panned due to its dated graphics and lackluster fighting-game style boss battles. The European and American versions differentiate slightly in level music and terrorist names with Saddam Hussein only being present in the European version.

According to an unlockable documentary snippet included in-game, development began before the September 11th terrorist attacks. In the wake of the attacks and as development continued, Osama Bin Laden would become a more prominent character in the game, ultimately serving as the primary antagonist.</desc>

		<desc>FullMetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel is an action role-playing game that follows the adventures of two brothers: Edward Elric, a gifted young alchemist who is missing an arm and a leg, and Alphonse Elric, whose spirit was transferred to a powerful suit of armor when his whole body was compromised.
 The two boys were maimed when performing a forbidden ritual to return their lost mother to life, and now they quest to find the powerful magic stone that can restore their own bodies. Combat occurs in real-time, though good strategy before a fight can make all the difference; Edward can use his powers to transmute ordinary objects into powerful weapons, and it's always good to be prepared in the unpredictable urban and interior environments the boys must traverse.
 The game is based on a Japanese animated television series, which could be seen on the Cartoon Network's "Adult Swim" at the time of the game's release.</desc>

The game casts players in the role of Fry, Bender, Leela, or Dr. Zoidberg, with each character having his or her own distinct moves and weapons. In their quest to right a terrible wrong, players will run through futuristic New New York (in the year 3000), revisit "old" New York, confront Sun Priests in Sun City, attack swamp monsters and gators lurking in the Bogad Bayou, and zip across an asteroid belt to zap giant robotic monsters living in a junkyard of space relics.
 

In addition to shooting enemies with their character's default weapon, players can perform basic moves such as jumping or climbing to reach new areas or to avoid potential hazards. Puzzle-solving aspects involve activating generators before using elevators on certain stages, and simply flipping the occasional switch or lever. Writers from the FOX television series created the game's story and dialogue, with design input offered by show creator Matt Groening himself. To maintain the vibrant yet simple look of the sci-fi series, the developers made use of a "toon-shading render engine" created specifically for the game. Actors from the original cast also provide the voice-overs for each of the main characters.</desc>

The battle system in Future Tactics combines tactics with a little bit of reflexes. By firing a gun you have to play some sort of mini game. The better you play, the more accurate your shot will be. Future Tactics uses cartoon-like 3D graphics with completely deformable terrain.</desc>

		<desc>Fancy hats, oval turf tracks and people waving tiny bits of paper on the stands. Welcome to the world of horse racing. While most other racing games have the player controlling a motorized vehicle (such as a car or a powerboat), or using physics to move closer to the goal (skiing, sailing and so on), in G1 Jockey the player is controlling an animal, which makes it slightly different from other racing games in the market.

The player has to balance four things - the overall speed of the horse, the stamina, horse motivation, and the potential, which affects for how long the horse can keep the speed high after all stamina was lost - crucial for the last stretch sprint. It's impossible to raise all four at once, so players must have a well defined strategy to succeed.

Depending on their abilities, each horse might be better suited for a particular strategy or type of race, and each must be treated differently to achieve the best possible result. The game features a large roster of horses, and many tracks to choose from, including flat track and steeplechase races. Game modes include race training, a tutorial, two player mode, and the career mode, where the player starts as a rookie jockey, and must complete races and training sessions to attract the attention of better stables.</desc>

As in the earlier game, the action is over-the-top, with huge hits, resounding slams, sky-high jumps, and cartoonish special effects, but the interface is designed to offer tight control, even in the middle of the chaos.
 Matches are fought in one of seven different rings and more than 45 characters are available (though some must be unlocked through skillful play). The game's six modes of play include multiplayer competitions, such as "Tag Team," Five on Five," and "Battle Royale." Up to four PS2 gamers can enter the Galactic Wrestling ring together using a multi-tap device.</desc>

		<desc>Gallop Racer 2001 is the inaugural iteration of Tecmo's venerable horseracing simulation on the PlayStation 2. Combining elements of strategy, stable management, and actual racing, Gallop Racer 2001 offers wannabe stable owners the chance to embark on what will hopefully prove to be a fruitful career raising champion horses. The Season mode allows players to take on the role of both the stable manager and jockey. Beginning with a meager allotment of Jockey Points (the in-game currency), players will need to purchase a horse before they can enter a race. Horses vary not only in appearance, but in ability as well, with particular strengths and weaknesses in regard to temperament and guts, amongst others. Additionally, each has specific preferences pertaining to turf on and running style.</desc>

This entire setting is set in a theme park-style arena called Gallop Racing Square.

Not only can players create their own horses, but they can also race classic and legendary horses from previous years in the history of horse racing.  The gameplay is virtually the same as previous versions, pressing buttons at a certain point in time to urge the horse while racing, with several gauges to monitor such as the horses stamina, their position in the race as well as their mental condition.  Players can also bet in races, with a true feel of betting simulation, figuring in weather conditions, the horses conditions as well as the horses stats.</desc>

		<desc>Gauntlet is back for yet another iteration. The Emperor has crucified his four loyal heroes to a magic tree, driven by a maniac thirst for their immortality. Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done.

This version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack'n'slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks.

Defeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold.

The game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together.

The newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature. Played online, the game is identical to a regular multiplayer game, with each player on a different box.</desc>

Scoring is based on the overall timing of the words. The words do not have to be sung correctly. It also registers when random noises are made as long as the timing is correct. As it mostly consists of rap songs, there is a bar and spacing between the words to provide help with the lyrical flow, along with a moving color highlighting the words. Songs can be sung in three difficulty levels.

Everything goes horribly wrong when London's most vicious criminal, the organized crime boss Charlie Jolson, decides that he needs Mark's services and obtains them in a twisted and cruel way: Mark's wife is murdered, he is framed for this murder, and his child gets kidnapped. 

Jolson makes it clear: unless Mark does what he orders him to do, the boy dies. Using the helpless man in his plan to bring down other criminal organizations of the city, Jolson sends Mark on suicidal missions during which Mark has three terrible choices: walk away and lose his son, get killed in a battle against overwhelming odds, or single-handedly help Jolson to get rid of his adversaries.

Once the player completes Mark Hammond's story, a new scenario opens, in which the player controls Frank Carter, a vigilante cop who won't stop until he brings Charlie Jolson to justice. Frank's scenario is parallel to Mark's, shedding more light on events that remain somewhat unexplained during Mark's scenario.</desc>

		<desc>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex follows the Japanese animated television series of the same title, which is based on the manga of Masamune Shirow and lauded for its blend of existential insight and sci-fi action. This third-person action-adventure interpretation for PlayStation 2 features platforming through futuristic urban environments, a number of hacking puzzles based on the cybernetic protagonists' special abilities, and, when necessary, a fair share of shoot-'em-up action. Players can control Major Motoko Kusanagi and officer Bateau through the game, making use of the ability to "hack" into the minds of other cyborgs to steal key information or get hints of enemy plans and locations.</desc>

		<desc>Ghost Rider roars off the comic book page and onto PlayStation 2 as an action game that combines fiery combat and frenzied driving. Players slip into the black leather jacket of Johnny Blaze, a former stuntman whose soul is now entwined with a demon, as they prepare to mete out justice using the character's signature hellfire chain and hellfire shotgun. Viewed from a third-person perspective set behind Ghost Rider, the game has players battling multiple foes at once using a combo-based fighting engine.
 Driving sequences on Ghost Rider's skull-emblazoned Hell Cycle let players continue the carnage as they swing the chain at nearby enemies and zip across water, rocket over jumps, and more. As players advance deeper into the game, they will confront familiar villains from the comic book series and unlock an assortment of bonus features, including interviews, extra characters, artwork, and other surprises. Ghost Rider features locales from the 2007 film starring Nicholas Cage and a storyline penned by comic writers Garth Ennis and Jimmy Palmiotti.</desc>

		<name>God of War</name>
		<desc>God of War is an action-oriented adventure game with a strong focus on fast-paced combat. Players take control of Kratos, a mystically powerful hero in the ancient Greece of classic mythology. Kratos can perform super-human leaps, agile dodges, and magically enhanced combo attacks, which all flow together in a stream of intense engagement. The fast-paced, over-the-top fighting, combined with the tense environments and computer-directed camera angles, give gameplay the feel of combat-adventures such as Devil May Cry or Otogi.
 Unlike those earlier blends of survival-horror presentation and combat-minded control schemes, however, God of War is set in a world more immediately familiar to all fans of western fantasy. The ultimate goal of Kratos is a conclusive confrontation with Ares -- the god of war himself -- but the hero must face a deadly succession of monsters and villains from Greek mythology as he pursues this end. The Hydra, Medusa, the Cyclops, the Minotaur, and other legendary creatures will all have their chances to destroy Kratos before he meets his final destiny.</desc>

		<desc>Invoking the name of Rare's 1997 first-person shooter for N64 -- easily its most highly acclaimed James Bond game predecessor -- 2004's GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is an original super spy adventure experienced from a different point of view. Developed by Electronic Art's Los Angeles studios, the game has players taking the role of an MI6 agent working toward elite "00" license-to-kill status, who is dismissed for "reckless brutality." Seizing the opportunity to bring such a highly skilled and well-trained operative into his own organization, infamous Bond supervillian Auric Goldfinger welcomes the player's disenfranchised agent into his ranks.
 Like its N64 forebear, the 128-bit version of GoldenEye is a first-person shooter with lots of opportunity for multiplayer action. Standard deathmatches and domination games are supported, as well as a "Tug of War" game that has teams competing to move a bomb across the map by flipping a series of switches. Four-player split-screen play is offered, and properly equipped PlayStation 2 and Xbox gamers can go online to find competitive multiplayer games for up to eight. Also like the original, Rogue Agent features a full single-player campaign as well.</desc>

		<name>Gran Turismo 4</name>
		<desc>GT4 continues in its predecessors' footsteps by offering an extremely large list of cars; the PAL version features 721 cars from 80 manufacturers. 

Players now accumulate points by winning races in the normal first-person driving mode, called A-Spec mode. Each race event can yield up to a maximum of 200 A-Spec points. Generally, a win using a car with less of an advantage over the AI opponents is worth more points. Points can only be won once, so to win further points from a previously-won event, it must be re-won using a car with less of an advantage over the AI. There are also the 34 Missions which can yield 250 points each. Despite this, A-Spec points are experience points, not money.</desc>

		<desc>There are a million stories in Liberty City. This one changes everything. Once a trusted wise guy in the Leone crime family, Toni Cipriani was forced into hiding after killing a made man. Now he's back and it's time for things to be put right.

The streets of Liberty City are in turmoil. Warring mafiosi vie for control as the town begins to self-destruct under waves of political corruption, organized crime, drug trafficking and union strikes. No one can be trusted as Toni tries to clean up the mess of the city's chaotic underworld. Deranged hit men, morally depraved tycoons, cynical politicians and his own mother stand in his way as Toni tries to bring the city under Leone control.

Forced to fight for his life in an odyssey that will shake Liberty City to its foundations, Toni must use any means necessary to secure his place in the leadership of the Leone family in a town up for grabs.</desc>

The leader of the organization for whom he used to work, Sonny Forelli, fears that Tommy's presence in Liberty City will heighten tensions and bring unwanted attention upon his organization's criminal activities. To prevent this, Sonny ostensibly "promotes" Tommy and sends him to Vice City to act as their buyer for a series of cocaine deals.[7] During Tommy's first meeting with the drug dealers, an ambush by an unknown party results in the death of Tommy's bodyguards, Harry and Lee, and the cocaine dealer. There is another survivor, the pilot of the dealer's helicopter, who flies off and escapes. Tommy narrowly escapes with his life, but he loses both the Forelli's money and the cocaine.</desc>

		<name>Grand Theft Auto : Vice City Stories</name>
		<desc>Vice City Stories is a prequel to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2 years earlier) and it is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. Set in 1984, players take on the role of Vic Vance, an army soldier who loves his country, family, and himself. One bad decision turns everything around and he is kicked onto the streets of a tough city. He has to build an empire to survive, or be left to die. Together with his brother Lance, a drug addict, the siblings try to take over Vice City.

Just like other GTA titles, gameplay consists of third-person shooting and driving sequences in an open environment. You will meet new enemies and gangs, and old foes. The missions require you to kill with a selection of weapons, steal vehicles such as a car, a boat, or a plane, rob to make it big, or just to have fun.</desc>

		<name>Grandia Xtreme</name>
		<desc>The Spirits, who once protected the world, have gone loose. Running around wildly, they created monsters who disturbed the peace in the world and provoked two mighty nations to start an all-destroying war. After years of battles and pain, the two nations finally decided to sign a peace agreement. Now they wish concentrate together on hunting down and eliminating the insane Spirits. You control a young boy named Evan, who wants to become a Ranger (a fighter who possesses unique abilities), like his father. But before he can be initiated as a Ranger, he has to fulfill an important mission and help to save his world from the Spirits.

Grandia Xtreme is the first Grandia game to be originally released for Playstation 2. Its combat system is virtually the same as in the previous two games, a mixture of strategic planning and combo attacks. Your party members can run around, avoid enemy attacks, and their attack power depends on their distance from the enemies. Grandia Xtreme is heavily based on combat, with more dungeons, more fighting, and less story than the two previous installments of the series.</desc>

As with previous games in the series the game involves tournament-styled battles between characters using their special abilities and moves. However for GG Isuka the battles are 2-on-2 instead of 1-on-1, taking place in multi-plane arenas (similar to Fatal Fury) and requiring the players to switch orientation manually.

Added features include two new characters (only one playable), new backgrounds and game modes including the new "Boost" mode, which turns the game into a 2D side scrolling beat 'em up.</desc>

Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong.</desc>

The series, known for making gamers feel like rock stars, first put real rock stars into games with the inclusion of guitar gods Slash and Tom Morello as boss characters in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, but Guitar Hero: Aerosmith lets players follow the legendary Boston-based quintet's ascension from the tiny Nipmuc High School auditorium to center stage at the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show.
 More of a healthy, Aerosmith-themed expansion of Guitar Hero III than a completely new entry in the series, Guitar Hero: Aerosmith nevertheless offers more than 40 new rock songs to which gamers can shred. The track list is heavy with Aerosmith classics like "Dream On," "Sweet Emotion," and "Rag Doll," but the game also features songs from groups that have influenced or toured with the band, including Mott the Hoople, New York Dolls, and The Black Crowes.</desc>

This title largely borrows from the novelties introduced in Guitar Hero: World Tour, with band career modes for single or multiple players with a storyline drawn as a cartoon, competitive modes online, and the possibility to play with different instruments such as a regular guitar, a bass guitar, drums, and doing the vocals. The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game.</desc>

		<name>Guitar Hero 5</name>
		<desc>Guitar Hero 5 is the fifth main game in the musical rhythm series. Similar to the previous title, Guitar Hero: World Tour, the focus is on a band-experience, with a lead and bass guitar, drums and vocals. The title is available standalone or bundled with the instruments.

Next to a new soundtrack with 85 songs, many animated lead singers are now modelled after famous musicians such as Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Kurt Cobain, and Matthew Bellamy. Players can still compose their own songs in the included studio and the game relies heavily on downloadable content, through tracks and full albums. A portion of the songs of Guitar Hero: World Tour, Guitar Hero Smash Hits and Band Hero can be imported in exchange for a small fee per song.</desc>

		<name>Guitar Hero Encore : Rocks the 80s</name>
		<desc>Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series, using the features and gameplay from Guitar Hero II but with a completely new batch of songs. The game's theme is the eighties, reflected by the characters and their clothing, the venues and of course the songs themselves. It is the last title in the series developed by the original creators Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.
 As in the previous games, in the single-player mode the player works his way through a setlist unlocking increasingly difficult songs, divided over 4 main difficulties. By performing well, new songs and venues become available, but there are less unlockables compared to the previous titles. Notable bands in this edition include A Flock of Seagulls, The Police, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Asia, Dio and Anthrax. Unlike the previous games, there are no bonus tracks.
 The game is played through the guitar controller introduced for this series. The multi-player modes include Co-op, Face-off and Pro Face-off, identical to the previous game.</desc>

As a wannabe rockstar, you need to play songs by pressing combinations of five fret buttons on a guitar-shaped controller, while working the strum bar, along with an optional whammy bar for distortion. The sequel contains 64 songs, of which 40 have been licensed. One of the tracks was discovered through a contest at beaguitarhero.com, where unlicensed bands could send in a demo to be included in the game. Most of the tracks have been covered in-studio, but a few use original recordings.</desc>

Bent on the destruction of an evil criminal organization, Grave must traverse six unique environments, utilizing the dual handguns and coffin he possesses to literally destroy anything and everything in his path while doing so. At its most basic level, the gameplay in this third-person action title encourages players to destroy the various enemies along with the environments themselves. Uninterrupted carnage steadily increases the "Beat" meter, allowing players to achieve extended combos through carefully planned attacks. Higher scores and extra abilities are awarded for exemplary play.</desc>

		<desc>Three years after the events that took place in the original Gungrave, the Corsione family has unleashed the deadly drug SEED upon the populace. Now it's up to Grave, Spike and Mika to follow the trail of SEED back to its source and eradicate it once and for all.

Much like its predecessor, Gungrave: Overdose offers up several action-packed levels that simply don't allow the player to let up on the fire button. This sequel ups the ante with even larger hordes of enemies to blast through along with a slew of destructible environments to wreak havoc in. Along the way, Grave will team up with newcomers Juji and Billy. Juji fights using a unique combination of close-range guns and swordplay, while Billy defeats his enemies with the sheer power of his electric guitar.

Gungrave: Overdose features character designs by Yasuhiro Nightow (creator of the anime/manga Trigun) and Kosuke Fujishima (known for his work on Sakura Wars, Ah My Goddess, and the Tales series), and soundtrack composition by Tsuneo Imahori (composer for Trigun, Hajime no Ippo and the Gungrave anime series). This game was released by Mastiff as a budget-priced title.</desc>

The third expansion for the original game, it features two-player cooperative gameplay (in split-screen) with the two female scientists Gina Cross and Colette Green as the protagonists. It is meant to be played with two players at the same time as it is more puzzle-oriented than the original game and the first two expansions.

The game starts with a player selecting which of the four Hogwarts school teams he or she wishes to play for.

As the player wins games and completes specific challenges (such as ?score 120 points in one game?) they collect Quidditch cards which unlock special combo moves.  Once a player has won the school championship, they can go on to play as one of nine international teams competing for the Quidditch World Cup each with it?s own style and special combo moves.  After winning the cup once, there are still more cards to be collected by playing and winning as different teams.</desc>

		<desc>In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again. In the game, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory.

Other aspects of gameplay include attending Herbology, Charms, Transfiguration, and Potions classes as well as completing side-missions for professors.



 Based off the fifth book and movie of the series, players take control of Harry Potter in this 3D adventure as he faces the dangers of his fifth year of Hogwarts, avoiding the malicious Professor Dolores Umbridge, builds Dumbledore's Army, and faces off with Voldemort himself as the prophecy continues to unfold.
 Players will navigate through the castle of Hogwarts and beyond, learning fifth year spells, solving multiple puzzles, avoiding traps, and even get a chance to play as the Weasley brothers, Sirius Black and Dumbledore himself.</desc>

Harry can leap across chasms and climb ropes.  Ron can sense secret areas.  Hermione, being the smallest, can fit into areas where the others can't.  Players can also control Hedwig the owl, or Buckbeak the hippogriff to accomplish other tasks and overcome obstacles.

		<name>Harvest Moon : A Wonderful Life, Special Edition</name>
		<desc>Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life expands on the farm simulation aspects of its predecessors by having players develop a "life" through marriage and raising a family. Farming in this GameCube version is further enhanced by having more animals to care for, more crops to harvest, and an option for players to create hybrid vegetables by combining the seeds of two different types. As in earlier titles in Natsume's Harvest Moon series, players are not confined to a rigid storyline or plot while advancing through the game. Players are free to do whatever they want in the effort to become successful in both business and in life.

 This PS2 "Special Edition" of A Wonderful Life adds to the GameCube original by allowing players to earn the chance to play as either a boy or a girl, and by providing more potential spouses for courtship. It also allows players to continue to work and develop their farms, even after they've completed the main campaign. New features for the PS2 version include up to four wives to marry, to have a son or a daughter with a mini career path, new farming equipment such as the fertilizer machine, and a free play mode to continue playing when all the chapters have been completed.</desc>

		<name>Harvest Moon : Save the Homeland</name>
		<desc>Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland marks a significant shift in focus for the series, becoming more of a "life simulation" than the "farm simulation" it once was. Unlike previous incarnations where the main objective was to resurrect a dying farm and ultimately turn a profit, this PS2 title presents players with a slightly more desperate predicament: The land upon which the village is built has been earmarked for the development of a new resort complex. Construction begins in exactly one year and in that time you'll have to find a way to save the village. Incidentally, there are nine different ways that this can be achieved, providing nine different game endings.
 Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland is also the first title in the series to make use of 3D environments, and has included a user-definable camera that can be manipulated as needed with the aid of the right analog stick. The game also makes use of "cel-shading" -- a technique that has become synonymous with cartoon-style games.</desc>

Acting as a force for order, the two will travel to the city's wealthy, well-lit "Above," as well as its dark and downtrodden "Below," to enforce a justice once common to both of these two, disparate places.</desc>

		<desc>Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the DragonBone Staff is really the old classic King's Bounty from New World Computing for the PC with revamped graphics. Very little else has changed, in fact even the text was the exact same with the original.

 For those who are not familiar with the history of the series, King's Bounty was a spin-off of the Might &amp; Magic RPG series which was then still in its early chapters and was inspired by board games. The gameplay resembles a simplified Heroes of Might &amp; Magic game with only one Hero and no city improvements. Combat is turn-based using a set grid and stacked units.

 The goal of the game is to discover an ancient artifact by collecting pieces of a map and identifying its location before time runs out. Of course the player must have amassed a strong army by then because he will have to face the evil Dragon overlord before the end.</desc>

It soon becomes obvious that it's anything but, and the duo eventually uncover an alien conspiracy -- the outcome of which will determine the fate of the human race.


 Gameplay is patterned after Toka's Dreamcast effort, in that players select a character (either a male or female pugilist) and must fight their way through a series of enemy-laden environments using the handful of melee attacks available to them. Offering brief respite from the constant hand-to-hand combat are the projectile weapons that can be found in each level.</desc>

		<desc>Bringing High Heat to a new level, this 2004 version takes all the best from previous versions and adds more to give you a top-notch baseball game.

This new version brings you improved graphics thanks to a new graphics engine.  You also get new career and franchise modes so you can manage your own team and build up multi-year stats for it.  Recruit from all the minor leagues (A through AAA) to help your team become the best.

Play the 2-on-2 Showdown and select a pitcher and batter to compete against another pitcher and batter.  This does not include competing against another human player in the PC version, which has no multiplayer support.

Also, experience a more realistic audio environment as you hear people yelling and cheering, and vendors selling hot dogs, not to mention the return of the two-man announcer team.

Watch realistic player movements, including jumping and diving for the ball, sliding, and even shaking fists when hit by the ball.</desc>

This time he goes on a trip around America, undertaking missions in major cities such as Las Vegas, New Orleans, Los Angeles and other exotic locations. This time, he better watch his back, as his long-time employer, the International Contract Agency, is threatened by a mysterious rival.
 On the run from rival assassins, Agent 47 hops a plane to take care of business stateside in Hitman: Blood Money. Players will guide Agent 47 through a number of locales, including New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas as he performs hits. It's up to the player to determine the manner in which a hit is executed, but the "rookie training" mode can show amateur assassins how to help targets have "accidents," by pushing the victim over a ledge or pinning him underneath something heavy.</desc>

		<name>Hitman : Contracts</name>
		<desc>Hitman: Contracts is a third-person stealth game. Players take the role of "47", a hitman who is unlucky enough to get shot, and falls to the floor dying. The whole game takes place in "flashbacks", where 47 is reminiscing about past missions, some of which were previously seen in Hitman: Codename 47, the first game from the Hitman series.

Gameplay in Hitman: Contracts is similar to the previous installments. Your job will be to complete several missions which involve assassinating targets all over the world. You can sneak around in disguise to avoid the suspicious guards, or you can instead open fire on everyone you see. When you complete your mission, you're given a rating - from "Mass Murderer" up to the coveted "Silent Assassin". If you manage to complete a mission with a "Silent Assassin" rating, you receive a reward: a special weapon (such as dual sawed-off shotguns), and you can try playing a previously completed mission using one of the special weapons.</desc>

Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone, and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives. 

Typically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards.</desc>

There are a number of different courses, characters, clubs, and ball types to choose from.  New equipment can be purchased with experience points, which your characters earn by winning matches.  Better equipment will ease up the games difficulty a bit by providing greater accuracy, distance, and control.

As an addition feature, the game has an international ranking system of sorts.  With a password from the game you can post your scores on a website, where you can see how you measure up against everyone else out there.</desc>

Sticking to the series' successful mix of approachable interface and realistic action, the game offers players numerous perspectives of each lie and shots are made through button taps, timed to a fluctuating bar that determines power and accuracy.
 Hot Shots Golf Fore! offers a dozen courses (some of which were featured in Hot Shots Golf 3), and an even greater selection of characters to play through them. As in earlier games, certain characters are available from the start and players will need to unlock the others, but all can be customized with different clothing and equipment. A number of caricatured caddies are also available, to offer support and advice (sometimes, whether it's wanted or not).
 A favorite feature from the PlayStation's original Hot Shots Golf returns in this version: the ability to play 18 holes of carom-friendly miniature golf. Hot Shots Golf Fore! is also the first in the series to offer online play. PlayStation 2 gamers with the PS2 Network Adaptor can log in to join other virtual golfers from all over the country. The online mode supports text chat, allowing two players to talk back and forth in real-time via keyboard.</desc>

		<desc>Hunter: The Reckoning makes its PlayStation 2 debut as a platform exclusive sequel that introduces a number of features absent from the Xbox original and later GameCube port. While the follow-up still involves fighting zombies, vampires, and demons from a third-person perspective, players now have a choice of five characters instead of four. The storyline picks up two years after the events chronicled in the first game: although the team cleansed the tainted streets of Ashcroft, new reports from a mysterious hunter named Joshua suggest the city is once again in danger from being overrun by dark forces.</desc>

		<desc>Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is based on the animated movie of the same name. The story has the basic premise that Sid gets kidnapped by dinosaurs and his friends need to save him. During the course of the game the player takes control over six characters - most of them vary notably regarding gameplay.

Most of the time is spent in a 3rd person platformer where the player controls his character while jumping over gaps, avoiding enemies and collecting items. Depending on the character the player has different attacks at his disposal. There are also numerous levels with are basically mini games, e.g. a classic 2D platforming section, a side-scrolling shooter, balancing on a snowball or dogfights while riding a pterodactyl.</desc>

		<name>Ice Age 2 : The Meltdown</name>
		<desc>Ice Age 2: The Meltdown is loosely based on the movie of the same name. The game takes place in prehistory - you play as Scrat, the hapless (but not totally helpless!) proto-squirrel, helping your friends escape the coming of a huge flood.

The WASD keys move you forward and back, left and right, and the mouse controls camera movement and some actions. Scrat has a few special moves as well, such as sniff, his spin attack, a double jump, a ground stomp (useful for breaking ice) and a roll attack. Much of the game consists of hunting down acorns and other special nuts for health renewal or for unlocking bonuses. There are a few mini-games within the game - you can play as Sid, zipping along an ice slide while avoiding obstacles; there's also penguin-bowling and a mini-game where you "shoot" at monkeys to regain a walnut that was whisked out from under your nose.</desc>

		<desc>A young boy in a magical world has been born with a strange deformity: large horns that jut out of both sides of his head. The people of his village, fearful of retribution from above, feel they have no choice but to sacrifice this mutant child to appease their gods. To that end, they have taken this boy, named Ico, to a massive, supposedly deserted castle and left him in a giant urn. But when the urn breaks, spilling Ico into the bowels of the fortress, he will soon find his adventure is just beginning. Along the way he'll meet a mysterious princess who has been held captive in the castle for untold years. Although they cannot communicate through speech, they soon forge an unspoken bond, and it is clear that if either of them wants to make it out of the castle alive, their destinies must remain intertwined.</desc>

The unique aspect of the game is arrow modification. Arrows can be modified which can alter the difficulty with things such as no jumps, spinning, or increased speed making things easier or harder for the player.</desc>

Boasting "Unstoppable Movement" means Hulk can run across walls and other vertical surfaces, climb any wall by digging his fingers into concrete, leap huge heights and distances all under the player's control. Hulk's combat abilities also reflect this increased power; cars and buses are simply smashed out of the way while fully charged attacks will toss vehicles, enemies and unlucky pedestrians into the air. At his most powerful, the Hulk can perform one of five different ultra-powerful Devastator attacks including the Critical Atomic Slam and the Critical Thunderclap. These attacks will clear enemies out for a multi-block radius, flatten entire buildings, and cause massive damage to enemies.</desc>

 From San Francisco's Chinatown to the lush jungles of Panama, Indy must use his whip, fists and wits to fight through ruthless opposition as he spars with his nemesis, Magnus V?ller, in a race for a relic of biblical proportions - the Staff of Moses.
 Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings is a third-person action-adventure game of daredevil leaps, death-defying rides, and ancient puzzles, and occasional fisticuffs with local ruffians and villainous henchmen. In an original story created for the game by LucasArts, Indy seeks to recover the Staff of Moses before it falls into the hands of a never-before-seen adversary named Magnus Voller.</desc>

		<name>Indigo Prophecy</name>
		<desc>Indigo Prophecy (Fahrenheit in Europe) is a psychological thriller in which the player is able to control different characters on both sides of a murder - the killer and those who are trying to find him. The game's core gameplay style is adventure. The three protagonists explore various locations, talk to other characters, and interact with the environment in order to advance. However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require the player to press the correct button during a scene.

The game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and cleaning the floor requires the player to move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one. The player's choice will sometimes influence the subsequent events and the outcome of the entire story, eventually leading it to one of the three possible endings.</desc>

The animated series involves the story of a schoolgirl named Kagome, who falls down a well and is magically transported to feudal Japan, where she meets her rival/companion/love-interest Inuyasha, a dog-like half-demon boy.
 Together, the two go on adventures to recover the scattered pieces of an ancient, shattered artifact. In The Secret of the Cursed Mask, players take the role of one of two new characters (created especially for the game by anime artist Rumiko Takahashi) who have been sent back in time just like Kagome. They'll make friends and enemies in the legendary lands of InuYasha, and these relationships will have great influence over their ultimate quest to return to the present-day world.</desc>

		<desc>Inspired by Marvel's summer-2008 cinema, Iron Man returns to consoles and handhelds in a concurrently released combat action game. Players take the role of the troubled engineering genius (and billionaire) Tony Stark, creator of a powerful suit of high-tech armor he wears to become the title hero. Combat takes place both on the ground and in the air, and players have access to the hero's power armor abilities, including rocket boots and repulsor rays.
 The game plays out across large, open, multi-objective battlefields, where Iron Man can re-purpose objects and equipment to attack enemies or cripple their defenses, as well as put his suits' arsenal to good use. As in the film and comics, different armor suit options become available as the story progresses, offering different powers.</desc>

		<name>The Italian Job</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie remake of the 1969 film, The Italian Job is the story of a gang of thieves who stage the ultimate gold heist of all time. Little do they know that one of their gang members has double-crossed them, taking the gold and leaving them for dead.

As a member of the team, it is your job to stage the next big heist of all time, taking back the gold from your former friend. The game allows you to control a range of vehicles which you must drive to destinations before a certain time limit in order for the plan to work. Of course, the Mini comes into play as you escape from police.

Apart from the movie based story mode, you can also drive the Mini's through a range of multiplayer modes, including stunt driving and circuit racing.</desc>

		<desc>Presenting a combination of monster breeding and RPG elements, Jade Cocoon 2 expands upon Genki's original title in a number of significant ways. Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough.</desc>

		<desc>After saving Haven City once again, Jak and Daxter find themselves poisoned forced into competition on the international car-racing circuit by the execution of Krew's will.

Featuring over a dozen customizable vehicles designed with unique handling characteristics, players will race their whip through 20 tracks in eight different terrain arenas. With an assortment of power-ups available, including projectile weapons, mines, ranged weapons, turbo boosts, shields, and smart bombs, players should have the means necessary to ensure they're the first to cross the finish line.

The game supports both offline and online multiplayer. Offline multiplayer is the typical two-player split-screen multiplayer. Online multiplayer is playable with up to five other players. Both modes feature the same game types, which are the same as the single player except that human players are replacing the AI.</desc>

		<name>Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</name>
		<desc>The creators of the beloved Crash Bandicoot series bring out a new duo of heroes for 3D platforming on the PS2 with this release of Naughty Dog's Jak and Daxter. While Jak is a handsome young hero with big blue eyes and bushy blond hair, his companion Daxter has been transformed into a small weasel-like creature by a strange dark curse. The two heroes set out to seek the forgotten secrets of the Precursors, an ancient race that inhabited the land many ages ago. Only by seeking the wisdom of the ancients can they hope to change Daxter back to his natural form.

 The game is designed to provide a large 3D world populated with towns, ruins, and diverse wilderness areas and it does not follow any strict level progression. The storyline is open-ended enough to allow Jak and Daxter to find their own way through the adventure, searching the land, accepting quests, and taking on powerful boss characters in the order the player chooses. By helping local inhabitants Jak and Daxter can earn power cells, which help to open up new areas. The heroes also find new weapons and gain new spell as they journey through the land.</desc>

As in the speculative fiction action series on which the game is based (and which was dropped from Fox's Friday night lineup a season before the game's release), players enter a post-apocalyptic Seattle, WA, where high-tech science fiction gadgetry is juxtaposed with sordid, urban desperation.
 Trusting few aside from her computer-genius companion Logan, Max must challenge the cruelly mercenary Manticore group to save other "super soldiers" who, like her, were engineered to be soulless, military machines. The action takes place through a variety of environments that will put Max's enhanced speed, strength, and agility to the test. Dark Angel features the voices of Jessica Alba and Michael Weatherly, the actors who portray Max and Logan on the television show.</desc>

If the question is correct, the player earns that amount of money; otherwise they lose it.

It was released for the PlayStation 2 in North America on October 29, 2002. The game involves the player racing a jetski on various courses while maneuvering the vehicle around various obstacles. Unlike similar games like those in the Wave Race series, however, Jet X2O also places emphasis on performing tricks (which is a hallmark of many winter sports video games, including the SSX series). Despite the game's title, the game is not considered a spin-off of the Jet Moto series.</desc>

		<name>Jonny Moseley Mad Trix</name>
		<desc>Jonny Moseley Mad Trix is an extreme skiing game, in the vein of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.

As Jonny Moseley, or a number of other real-life skiers, you must perform various stunts, of which there are hundreds, to attract the attention of movie studio's, ultimately to film you on runs.

There are two modes of play; Slopestyle, where you can go down hills and perform stunts without any mission goals or other distractions, and Big Mountain, where you perform tricks to star in a ski movie.

By performing good tricks, you will be able to see your run on the "big screen".

In Big Mountain mode, you will ski down several real-life mountains, including Everest, Kilimanjaro, and the Alaskan mountains.  In Slopestyle, head down fictional environments, like a snowed-in San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Las Vegas.</desc>

		<desc>Though timed to coincide with the motion picture of the same name, Jumper tells a story that intertwines with that of the film, but is ultimately different than that of its movie inspiration. The game centers on Griffin, a young man on a quest to avenge his parents' death who uses his spontaneous teleportation abilities to battle a group know as the Paladins. Jumper's heavy emphasis on combat lets players take advantage of Griffin's unique abilities to perform three different kinds of dynamic "jumps." The Combat Jump lets players instantaneously move around Paladins in the midst of a fight sequence, the Traversal Jump allows gamers to pick a spot in the environment and jump to it, and the Finishing Jump lets players move enemies to completely new locations.</desc>

		<desc>Swedish developer Avalanche Studios' first in-house development project is a 3D action-adventure starring a U.S. operative named Rico Rodriguez. Just Cause has Rodriguez attempting to overthrow a fictitious South American island's regime by instigating a revolution.

 In the tradition of games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Just Cause features a free form world with an estimated 250,000 acres of territory to traverse by plane, car, boat, or in some cases, parachute. Since the island of San Esperito is filled with cities, towns, resorts, jungles, and mountains, players can acquire more than 100 vehicles throughout their tumultuous stay. The main storyline includes over 20 missions with objectives that can be accomplished by any number of means. Hundreds of side and bonus missions are also available for fun or profit, with stunt challenges like parasailing, vehicle leaping, or skydiving part of the itinerary for tropical thrill-seekers.</desc>

Players sing using the Logitech PS2 Headset (or other approved PlayStation 2 USB microphone devices).  The game rates the player's performance based on their vocal pitch and timing.  A visual indicator shows the player's current pitch in real time and also the pitch of vocals of the original song.  If the original notes of the song are too high for the player's vocal range, the game allows the player to sing at higher or lower octaves to hit the correct notes.</desc>

		<name>Katamari Damacy</name>
		<desc>The King of All Cosmos accidentally destroyed the stars andâ€”having recoveredâ€”wants the prince to rebuild them. Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to â€œroll upâ€ items increasing the Katamariâ€™s size until itâ€™s suitable for the King.

Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.

Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamariâ€™s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions. 

The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.</desc>

Developed by Lightweight, the third installment of the series changes the pace of the game with the addition of life bars and "combo" special attacks.
 While the predecessors focused on the same style of swordplay, the victor of the battles was unclear until the very end. The addition of life-bars specifically steers this title more towards arcade than simulation. Kengo: Master of Bushido introduces several different modes of play including a practice mode and a character story mode.</desc>

 Kessen is the story of two warring clans waging war against each other for control of the entire land, during 15th and 16th century Japan. Tokugawa Ieyasu is a very strong and powerful leader and is tired of seeing the country ruled by his archenemy, Toyotomi Hideyoshi.</desc>

		<name>Kessen II</name>
		<desc>It is a time of war. Many leaders from different factions fight to control their land. One such leader, Liu Bei, has only one wish: peace. But war stands in his way, after his land Shu is attacked by the kingdom of Wei, led by the warlord Cao Cao, who abducts Liu Bei's beloved Diao Chan, the keeper of the Imperial Seal. Liu Bei has to flee, but swears to return, exact revenge on Cao Cao, and liberate the kingdom of Shu.

Kessen II is a real-time strategy game, and a follow-up to Kessen. Unlike the first game, it is set in the Chinese Three Kingdoms period. The account of historical events is heavily fictionalized in the game, liberally adding new sub-plots (such as the entire romance angle of the story) and supernatural elements. The player can choose to command the armies of either Liu Bei or Cao Cao in their respective scenarios.

The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, the most notable change being the shift to supernatural warfare, including the addition of magical attacks such as tornadoes, lightning strikes, earthquakes, meteor showers, etc.  The player can now control 500 units at one time, as opposed to 100 in the previous game. New unit types (elite horsemen, elephant cavalry, etc.) have been added.</desc>

		<desc>In Kessen III the player takes control of Nobunaga Oda, and unlike the previous two games, you cannot choose a side to play on, and Nobunaga has one goal only... to unify the lands and rid his world of misery and suffering.

Following the prequels, this game comes with lots of cinematics and stays true to strategic as well as action gameplay, adding a few new things along the road, like collecting items during battles.

The two main aspects of this game are planning and engaging in battle. Select officers and strategically place them on the field of battle, assign commands and issue orders. When on the battlefield, each of the officers, including Nobunaga, will have his/her army at their disposal which can be controlled at any point. Level-ups bring additional special attacks to both officers and their troops.</desc>

		<name>Kill.switch</name>
		<desc>An innovative third person shooter that makes heavy use of a 'cover system'. This allows the player to 'attach' to objects so that they can fire at the enemy from a safe position. 

Basically you are some sort of enhanced soldier with no memory of who or where you came from. The story unfolds over the course of fifteen missions, spanning 5 levels, and through FMV cinematics. 

At first you'll cause all sorts of mayhem in various global hotspots, but as the past is made clear, the real enemy and their ultimate objective will be revealed.</desc>

		<name>Killer 7</name>
		<desc>In an alternate version of the Earth's history, a treaty was signed in the early 21st century, during which all countries willingly destroyed their nuclear arsenals, ending international conflicts. The presumed era of world peace, however, is marred by continuous attacks carried out by a new terrorist group called "Heaven Smile", which consists of human mutants under the influence of a lethal virus, and targets the United Nations and the International Ethics Committee (IEC). Meanwhile, the relationship between the United States and Japan deteriorate, as the latter becomes controlled by a party that proposes to sever connections to the USA.


 A group of assassins known as Killer7 is hired by a man named Christopher Mills, on behalf of the US government. The group is led by an elderly wheelchair-bound man named Harman Smith, endowed with an ability known as "Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon", which allows him to transform into seven different personalities who were professional assassins in their lives, and whose souls were absorbed by Harman after they were killed in a mysterious incident fifty years ago. Garcian Smith is the leading persona among these seven, and the only one who can communicate with Harman.</desc>

		<name>Kinetica</name>
		<desc>An original title from Sony Computer Entertainment, Kinetica is a high-speed futuristic racer akin to the likes of XG3 Extreme G Racing. In stark contrast to more conventional forms of racing, the racers in Kinetica wear futuristic suits with wheels attached to their hands and feet. As a result, the racers themselves become the vehicles. Far from a mere cosmetic choice, these suits play an integral part of the gameplay. Free from the hulking vehicles found in similar games, these racers can move their limbs independently, and as such, can perform a host of tricks and stunts. Players are required to execute these stunts by performing a combination of directional movements while holding the R1 button down. Correctly executing tricks fills a boost meter, which, once completed, provides the character with a limited speed boost.
 The racers themselves come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and include both male and female competitors. During a race, competitors are randomly awarded power-ups, with a range of uses. Tracks are scattered across a handful of environments, dropping racers into inhospitable alien worlds, caverns, and the requisite futuristic cities. Shortcuts, jumps, and tight turns prevail throughout the tracks, requiring players to master a variety of handling techniques.</desc>

All of the characters from the original MI return, and are joined by 4 newcomers and 14 secret guest stars, totaling a whopping 38 characters, each with a unique story mode and dozens of possible costumes.

The story this time deals with the appearance of the evil Jivatma in South Town, where all the heroes converge for their own personal reasons. Gameplay changes include the ability to sidestep and super cancel several moves; additional backgrounds and bonus features can be unlocked after beating the story mode, as well as completing the mission mode and time attack challenges</desc>

		<desc>The eleventh installment in SNK Playmore's long-running King of Fighters series and the ninth event in the official storyline, The King of Fighters XI is the first game in the series to forego the traditional numbering convention used by the series, and the first game in the series to move beyond the hardware capabilities of the Neo-Geo system. After the controversial resurgence of the Orochi power in the 2003 King of Fighters tournament, the tournament and the fighters return after a two year break in the action. Some are motivated to investigate the new Orochi situation and the antagonistic fighter Ash Crimson, while others enter the tourney to settle old scores...

The King of Fighters XI features a roster of 33 "team" characters, 7 PS2 exclusive characters, 5 mid-boss characters and 2 boss characters. In total, this allows a player to choose between +40 characters. Many of the characters are returning fighters from the other games in the KOF series, though notable new faces exist in the effective forms of Oswald, Duck King, Bonne Jenet, Elisabeth Blanctorche and Gai Tendo.</desc>

"Ahead lies something you need," he says, "but to claim it, you must lose something dear." The man vanishes before a single path, leading to a castle that eerily resembles a girl's drawing...

		<name>Lara Croft Tomb Raider : Anniversary</name>
		<desc>Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a remake of the original Tomb Raider. The remake has the same basic storyline, locations, and core gameplay; however, it has a technically more advanced graphics engine and adds several new features that were introduced in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend. Lara has many new moves, such as swinging on ropes, bullet time when an animal rushes towards her, and the addition of a grappling hook in her inventory (which resembles the one from the original game). Jumping is also a lot easier, as the heroine automatically grabs the ledges without requiring pixel-precise timing. There are also completely new moves, where Lara balances and jumps on small sticks.

The cutscenes are identical, but rendered in real-time using the new engine. Some are also action-based, like in the previous games, requiring quick reflexes to keep the action going. The environments and puzzles have been somewhat changed to fit the new gameplay, and the voice recording was also redone.</desc>

		<name>Lara Croft Tomb Raider : Legend</name>
		<desc>Indeed a legend in her own time, Lara Croft returns to consoles in 2006 with a new look, a new game, and a new developer. Revamped physics and an enhanced control scheme allow for more free-flowing action, while graphical improvements present a redesigned Lara who is immediately expressive, more believably proportioned, and as strikingly attractive as ever.
 Lady Croft's new look in Legend is based in part on 20-year-old British model Karima Adebibe. Lara now boasts smoother animations, a more realistic deportment, and a number of costume changes. The original Tomb Raider games were popular for their innovative blend of gaming styles as well as for their distinguished female lead, however, and this game is designed to return fans to the winning combination of 3D platforming, environmental puzzle-solving, and third-person shooting found in the blockbuster originals.</desc>

		<name>Lara Croft Tomb Raider : The Angel of Darkness</name>
		<desc>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness has been billed as the first true renovation of the best-selling series since the ground-breaking 1996 original. This edition is built on a completely new engine, which pumps out "next-generation" graphics and allows many new animations and interactions. Lara herself enjoys the engine upgrade as well, as she's now rendered with ten times the number of polygons as in earlier Tomb Raider games.
 The role-playing aspects of this adventure are slightly more central to play than in earlier games. Lara must enter a dark, supernatural world where nothing is certain. She must interact with other characters, and complex situations call for her to make ethical decisions where there is no clear-cut "good" or "evil" choice. Lara also develops throughout the game, as her abilities improve and adapt to the way she's played. A new system is designed to offer smoother control of Lara's many moves, which include new stealth attacks and hand-to-hand combat.</desc>

		<name>Legaia 2 : Duel Saga</name>
		<desc>A group of people known as Mystics live like outcasts, shunned by most humans because of their unique connection to the world of spirits: they are able to summon powerful supernatural beings called Origins. A small village of Nohl is a refuge for Mystics; one of them is a young swordsman named Lang, whose duty is to protect a crystal that supplies the town with water. One day, Lang meets a mysterious man who manipulates him into giving up the crystal. Determined to correct his mistake, Lang sets on a journey to retrieve the crystal, on which he will learn more of the role the Mystics and their Origins play in the world.

Legaia 2: Duel Saga is a follow-up to Legend of Legaia, though it is not directly connected to it story-wise, featuring a different cast of characters. Like its predecessor, it is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat. The game utilizes a system called "Arts", which requires the player to press a combination of buttons corresponding to fighting moves during battles. These are divided into the sub-categories "Normal Arts" (basic moves), "Hyper Arts" (more powerful moves that require special points to be spent), "Mystic Arts" (Origin powers), and, finally, "Variable Arts" (team attacks).

The game also features a Camping mode; accessing it, the player is able to communicate with the characters in the party, prepare meals from ingredients, and craft items such as weapons, armor, and accessories.</desc>

Little do they know that they are in for another adventure, where they will meet the mysterious Chronicler and eventually face off against Gaul, the Ape King.

The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night is a 3D action platformer which takes place right after the events at the end of The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning. Players control Spyro as he searches for his friend Cynder. Initially, he has lost all of his different breath powers from the first game, but he gradually recovers the ability to breathe fire, ice, earth and electricity. New to this game is the ability for Spyro to slow down time using his newly-learned 'Dragon Time' ability.</desc>

The basic concept is the same, with characters and objects built up using LEGO blocks, but here shown against surroundings drawn in a regular fashion. Most of the environments are side-scrolling with a fixed camera perspective, but in 3D with quite some depth. 
 The Dynamic Duo hits the bricks in LEGO Batman: The Videogame. In the game's main campaign, players take control of Batman and Robin for familiar bust-and-build action and puzzle-solving adventure through more than a dozen levels of Gotham City -- re-created completely from Lego brand toy building blocks, of course.</desc>

 The main campaign of the game is called Story Mode in which the player follows the film's stories with two pre-defined characters and cut-scenes.

The lighthearted action is still designed for players of all ages and abilities, but there is now more to see and do. New character-specific special moves are available, from Leia's head-knocking slaps to Obi-Wan's helmet-spinning use of the Force to confuse his attackers.

 As players progress through familiar movie scenes in the story mode, they can unlock more than 50 characters and even mix-and-match individual parts and accessories to create custom hybrids for use in the "free play" mode. Also new is the ability to build vehicles such as landspeeders, AT-STs, and speeder bikes, or to ride creatures like tauntauns and banthas. The original's cooperative play option returns with a revamped camera and more team-oriented challenges to overcome. As a special bonus, owners of the first game can unlock 54 additional characters for free play, expanding the roster to include Darth Maul and other fan favorites.</desc>

		<name>Leisure Suit Larry : Magna Cum Laude</name>
		<desc>Computer gaming's luckless lounge lizard, Larry Laffer, has retired his leisure suit, put away his martini glass, and is out of the romance game for good. His nephew, however, still has a glimmer of hope. The follow-up to Sierra's long-running graphic adventure series makes its PS2 debut courtesy of developer High Voltage Software, best known for games in the Hunter: The Reckoning series. Players take control of Larry Lovage, who not only has his uncle's receding hairline, but also his distinct talent for getting slapped whenever he's around women.

 In an attempt to jumpstart his humdrum life, Larry decides to participate in a reality-dating program being taped at his community college. Inspired by the humor in such films as American Pie and There's Something About Mary, the game will have players experiencing a number of risqu? and lewd plot twists through 20 levels of adventuring. Though it follows the same style of puzzles found in the first seven games in the series, players are free to explore the college campus in full 3D from a perspective set behind the stumbling seducer as he meets up with a variety of offbeat characters in his search for true love.</desc>

As in the movie, as well as the amusingly gloomy children's novels that inspired it, this Lemony Snicket game follows the notably unfortunate exploits of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire.
 Players will need to make use of each character's particular skills as they make their way through the game's 20-plus missions. In addition, they'll need to invent new tools to help them through certain situations, such as the bad-guy clearing Bopper, the sludge-traversing Stilts, and the rocket-pack Booster. Mission locations include, Count Olaf's Mansion, Uncle Monty's hedge maze, and Aunt Josephine's lakeside shack.</desc>

The more matches you make before the timeline wipes them clean, the bigger the combo multiplier towards your score.

As you progress through the game, Lumines will reward you with new "skins" which completely change the graphics, sound effects and music during play.

In "puzzle" mode, you stack the blocks in order to create the various shapes that you are shown.

Lumines also lets you play against the CPU or wirelessly against another player on the PSP.

The 2007 PS2 port is completely identical to the PSP version, except for some new skins.</desc>

There are a total of 24 different "weapons" and they include big hitters, defensive linemen, running backs, and catch receivers. Each "weapon" has a counter-weapon that gamers must uncover in order to bring a potentially destructive competitor down. However, by completing the mini-games in "Franchise" or "Owner" mode, players can alter the attributes for each team member.</desc>

		<name>Magic Pengel : The Quest for Color</name>
		<desc>Magic Pengel is centered on the player, as a character able to manipulate a "Pengel" (which looks like a stylized fairy combined with a paintbrush) to create a creature, or "Doodle". Using the Pengel (pronounced "pen-jell") as a cursor, the player simply sketches out the limbs, body, and other features. Depending on the amount of magic ink expended, and the types of body parts, the creature will be given certain statistics and created. With the help of Zoe and Taro, the character trains and battles using custom-created designs, which can be traded to or battled with the creations of other players. As the Doodles battle, they become more powerful, and earn points towards the purchase of pre-created Doodles, and extra abilities towards customizable creation. Combat functions according to three selections: attack, magic, and block, as well as a charge command. The three basic maneuvers follow a standard rock-paper-scissors methodology, but repetitiveness is minimized due to the varied attributes of the Doodles, as well as the inability to successively repeat any selection.</desc>

		<desc>Makai Kingdom is the fourth Nippon Ichi-developed tactical RPG on PlayStation 2 and it follows closely in the footsteps of the previous games of the same style, which are Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, La Pucelle: Tactics and Phantom Brave.

Lord Zetta, the king of Netherworld, tried to rewrite the history of the land but didn't succeed, and in the process brought demise onto himself. Three evil Overlords appeared before Zetta and promised to help him in his quest to take over the land once more. The player takes control of Zetta and his army to return Netherworld to its rightful owner.

The game mechanics consist of several stages in which the player must defeat the enemy or fulfill other tasks to advance to the next level. Fighting is done in turns, meaning that once the player has moved and attacked, it's the enemy's turn to move his troops one by one. When the battle is won, the next level becomes selectable. Between fights, you can improve your squad of fighters by buying better weapons, recruiting more soldiers and so on.</desc>

		<name>Manhunt</name>
		<desc>Manhunt is a third-person stealth horror game. The game consists of twenty levels, and four bonus levels that can be unlocked; the levels are referred to as "scenes". Players survive the Scenes by dispatching enemy gang members known as "Hunters", occasionally with firearms but primarily by stealthily executing them in gruesome, over-the-top ways.

The player is rated at the end of each level, primarily dependent on the gruesomeness of the killings and the speed of completion, from one (unimpressive) to five (extremely competent) stars. Executions are preferred in order to gain a higher score, thus encouraging players to play as viscerally as possible. The game's locales are full of "dark spots" and shadows where the player can hide while being chased by the Hunters; hiding in these dark areas makes the player invisible to opponents.</desc>

		<name>Marc Ecko's Getting Up : Contents Under Pressure</name>
		<desc>Contents Under Pressure is an action adventure that combines stealth and combat, as you guide urban graffiti artist Trane to fame. In the oppressed city of New Radius, you need to establish your name as an artist by laying down tags, burners and full pieces, but rival crews and law enforcement (Civil Conduct Keepers) are always on your tail. You will also uncover a conspiracy that plagues the city.
 The game is story-driven with linear level progression. Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces. As it is not a friendly environment, Trane can deliver a host of punch and kick combos, use grabs, humiliate other artists, and interact with the surroundings. Your art arsenal includes markers, brushes, cans and rollers. All available pieces are kept in your black book, and new styles are unlocked while playing.</desc>

Twenty Marvel superheroes have joined forces to combat the diabolical Dr. Doom and his Masters of Evil. The action will take players to Atlantis, the Skrull home world, the S.H.I.E.L.D.

Moves include a flurry of air and ground strikes, from grapples and blocks to chargeable powers and deadly combos. Objects within the environment can also cause damage, and a choice of one- and two-handed weapons can help less extraordinary heroes mete out justice against throngs of enemies.</desc>

		<name>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</name>
		<desc>Capcom's three-on-three arcade game, featuring popular characters from previous action, shooting, and fighting titles, comes to the PS2 with this release of Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Over 50 characters are available to fight as or against, two-dozen of which are initially playable. Each combatant offers a variety of aerial maneuvers, special attacks, and projectile blasts as players attempt to defeat their opponent's team.
 Rather than having all three characters fight on the screen at once, players swap fighters in and out of the match at any time, even for a single attack on an opponent. The remaining two characters rest on the sidelines until called upon to assist. In addition to a health bar, each fighter has a separate meter used for Hyper Combo attacks that can be powered-up to five increasingly destructive levels.
 Besides directly switching characters during a fight, players can press one of two assist buttons to have one of their teammates perform a pre-selected attack or defensive maneuver. If an opponent has unleashed an aerial attack, for example, pressing the assist button might have the second or third character enter the screen to perform an anti-air maneuver, thus leaving the primary fighter free from harm.</desc>

The game is structured as a road trip that takes the BMXers across the country, stopping in eight large, interactive city areas along the way to show off their best moves.
 Each area features multi-tiered objectives, the more difficult challenges encouraging a return after characters have improved their skills. Players can learn to "tweak" basic manuals, grinds, and airs to create all new feats of BMX greatness. Characters can also perform flatland tricks in this sequel. A variety of mini-games are included, for both one and two players, and the Course Editor allows creative gamers to create their own challenging areas.</desc>

Maximo fights wearing armor, if he is hit, he will lose corresponding pieces of armor and eventually be reduced to wearing his boxer shorts, with another hit resulting in him losing a life. If Maximo loses all his lives, he can continue by giving Death Coins to the Grim Reaper. However, every time he loses all his lives, the required cost for a continue increases.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to Maximo: From Ghosts to Glory, which was loosely based on the classic Ghosts 'n Goblins series, Maximo vs Army of Zin puts players in the role of Maximo, a master swordsman with a penchant for battling undead creatures. The action picks up where Ghosts to Glory left off, as the title hero must abandon his kingdom in order to search for his missing girlfriend. The developers at Capcom promise a more engrossing story this time around and have removed the hub screen, meaning each level flows into the next. There are 26 levels in all spread across six different environments.
 As in earlier games in the series, Maximo wears boxer shorts beneath his armor. However, the underwear in this game actually serves a functional purpose beyond comic relief.</desc>

		<desc>Like it's predecessors, MDK2: Armageddon is an action-packed third-person shooter with an off-beat sense of humor. Players will take on the roles of former janitor Kurt Havoc, the many-limbed canine cyborg Max, and the dangerously brilliant Doctor Hawkins in different stages of the adventure. The game features several tricky puzzles in addition to many alien bad guys in need of fragging.
 While MDK2: Armageddon is also a sequel to the successfully quirky original MDK, it is not a direct port of the Dreamcast or PC sequel versions of MDK2 released earlier the same year. The PlayStation 2's MDK2 features all of the levels and weapons available in other versions of the sequel, plus new items and areas available only in this "Armageddon" version.</desc>

		<desc>In Frontline, the player takes on a first person view and fights as an American OSS operative in D-Day. There are six missions in Frontline, each made up of several smaller levels. Briefings take place at the start of each mission, which advance the plot and introduce new characters. The smaller missions take place in a linear path, with the player fighting through towns and countryside, killing enemies and completing objectives. Objectives are explained to the character in a smaller briefing before each level, which prepares the player for that particular mission. The "War Room" serves as the game's main menu, and is reminiscent of Britain's secret underground intelligence bunkers during WWII.</desc>

Joe then makes his way to the topside and aids in shooting down Japanese planes. A few minutes later, he is blown from the ship and lands in the water, where a PT boat carrying Jack 'Gunny' Lawton, Frank Spinneli, and Silas Whitfield. Joe then shoots down more planes and also aids the USS Nevada (BB-36) to escape the harbor. Joe is then sent to the Philippines to destroy a bridge, and he meets his brother Donnie. Donnie is unable to escape the islands because his tank was overwhelmed by Japanese troops, forcing Joe to leave without him. Joe then goes to Guadalcanal at night to take over an airbase. Days later, the airfield is still taking heavy artillery fire, so Gunny assigns Joe and two other marines to destroy the artillery nicknamed 'Pistol Pete'. On the way Joe meets Edmund Harrison, a demolitions expert, and the real life Scottish guerilla fighter Martin Clemens. After this mission, Joe is promoted to Sergeant and recruited into the Office of Strategic Services (OSS).

You can play through the campaign with a friend in splitscreen.</desc>

		<desc>The plot of Mega Man X7 takes place in the 22nd century during an age when humans coexist with humanoid robots called "Reploids". As some Reploids participate in violent and destructive crime, a police organization called the "Maverick Hunters" was established to stamp out this activity. As the Reploid conflicts proceed after the Nightmare phenomena event of Mega Man X6, the world is slowly recovering. But as always, Maverick crime is rising in newly constructed cities. As this new crime wave hits, X finds himself trying to answer moral questions that have plagued him since he joined the Maverick Hunters: "Are we doing the right thing to solve this matter?", leading him to the decision of "I've had enough of this violence." Unable to assuage his conscience, he drops from the battle frontlines and assumes a more strategic support role at headquarters. With X's retirement, a massive power vacuum ensues and many independent groups develop, trying to fill the void left by the hunter. Prominent among these groups is the "Red Alert Syndicate", growing large enough to become a dominant force. The Red Alert is a new group of Reploids, similar to the Repliforce, but consisting of vigilantes. They claim to hunt Mavericks, but apparently do more than that. One of their members, Axl, decides he's had enough of their "murdering" and tries to leave the group. Red, the group's leader, is angered by Axl deserting, and goes on a rampage to get Axl back.</desc>

Mega Man X is joined in this adventure by two close associates, Zero and Axle, and each character has different strengths and abilities. Players can switch between two characters in the heat of battle, to solve a platform puzzle or fend of a particular enemy type, and the two characters not controlled by the player will try to help out in combat if the leading character becomes overwhelmed.
 Characters not controlled by the player recover more quickly when the hero onscreen is performing well. As in most games in the long-running Mega Man series, defeating a boss character earns the ability to use its special weapon. Other defeated enemies may leave behind metal bits, which can be collected and used to create custom power-ups. In addition to the side-scrolling platform levels, some boss fights and other events are played from alternate perspectives.</desc>

		<name>Metal Gear Solid 3 : Snake Eater</name>
		<desc>Hideo Kojima's critically acclaimed "tactical espionage action" series returns to PlayStation 2 in the anticipated follow-up to 2001's Sons of Liberty. Instead of slinking around futuristic installations, knocking on metal to distract guards, or crawling underneath a cardboard box, players are given a whole new Snake to wrangle. Drawing its inspiration from films like First Blood and Rambo: First Blood Part II, Snake Eater drops players in the middle of a thick jungle teeming with wildlife and, of course, terrorists.
 Heavily armed enemies dressed in camouflage gear will patrol the dense forests, waterfalls, and surrounding areas, so players will be able to climb trees, fire pistols while hanging down from branches, and crawl through hollowed out logs to stalk their prey. Along the way, Snake will have to find sustenance by catching fish or other wildlife, while being mindful of natural hazards such hornets nests, cliffs, and rapids. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater was first revealed in a 12-minute preview displayed at 2003's E3 in Los Angeles, California.</desc>

		<name>Metal Saga</name>
		<desc>A follow-up to the Metal Max games, Metal Saga is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as its predecessors - a world populated by bounty hunters, rangers, bandits, and mutant monsters. You take the role of a bounty hunter who has to travel the world, looking for "wanted" people. Accompanied by a soldier, a mechanic, and a cyborg dog, the hero must survive a journey west that will ultimately take him to remote places and lead him to battles against evil.

Metal Saga has a less linear story line that one would normally expect from a Japanese RPG - a story line that develops according to the missions you decide to take, which in their turn lead to new events and finally to different endings. The combat system features traditional party management and turn-based battles, with the addition of Metal Max's trademark tank combat. When you acquire tanks for your characters, you can use them in battles. Tanks get damaged and broken, but you will be able to customize them by finding parts scattered across the world and assembling them to build new models. Based on the model of tank many different kinds of weapons, cannons, and accessories can be equipped to it, making for hundreds of different options. Tanks can even be given a custom paint job that is saved to the memory card.</desc>

		<desc>Metropolismania is a city building game with a Japanese anime style. The goal is to grow a town to a target population. This is accomplished by interacting with NPCs and becoming friends by giving them gifts and talking with them. Attract citizens by building up the town with offices, grocers, entertainment and farming buildings (to name a few).

Rather than overlooking the environment, the player controls a character from a thirdperson perspective. Walking around, new constructions can be started and roads can be built. The buildings can be entered too. Side quests happen every level, some of which are quite strange. Expect to be involved in a smuggling ring or a cult.</desc>

Drawing from elements introduced in the two feature films as well as the classic television series, players must embark on a series of missions where stealth and strategy are designed to be every bit as important as hand-to-hand combat.
 Ethan Hunt has a variety of gadgets under his care, from chaff grenades to neutralize surveillance equipment to various cameras, sensors, and recording devices to elude alarms and enemies. If players find the guards to be unavoidable, Hunt can quickly dispose of them with a flurry of punches and kicks or a selection of weapons. As players navigate the combination of outdoor and indoor environments, they need to keep track of their objectives, which can number in the double digits on a single level. Each mission can also be completed in multiple ways.</desc>

The players act very realistic due to the fact they used motion capturing for almost every major player, giving it untolds amounts of realistic animation and almost giving them real emotions, such as if a pitcher gives up a big home run, you can see the disappointed on his face or if you hit a game winning home run your entire team goes nuts celebrating.

The game also comes with a fun set of mini games including the classic Home Run Derby and a new King of the Diamond, which has multiple levels, a timer and is constantly adapting to keep you guessing. The rosters even were up to date at the time, actually having the 2006 rosters instead of the previous year.</desc>

		<desc>Midway's first extreme sports title that tackles the great American past-time... baseball. Take control of all of your favorite Major League Baseball teams and players armed with all of their real stats, attributes, abilities and attitude. Slugfest features many playable minigames, a season mode, quick play and exhibition play.

So what makes MLB Slugfest extreme? The game is far from a real baseball simulation. This is as arcade as it gets. Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low.

Graphic touches include real player faces and details such as chewing gum and talking to teammates or opponents. Real stadiums all make their appearances along with several fantasy stadiums that can be unlocked.</desc>

In addition to the new Home Run Derby mode and Create-A-Team options, the game features the ability of pitchers to catch "On Fire" and impossible Special Pitches that zigzag, arc, and whizz by in ways that would leave any batter humiliated. New secret teams have been added to the previous bunch, including aliens, minotaurs, and Sub-Zero of Mortal Kombat fame. The customizable Instant Replay is another nice touch, allowing you to relive the awkward moments once you pause the game. And, of course, Tim Kitzrow and Jim Shorts return to the commentators' booth, making their signature random comments and incessant arguments.</desc>

		<name>Mobile Suit Gundam : Journey to Jaburo</name>
		<desc>Mobile Suit Gundam follows the exploits of Amuro Ray and his friends and colleagues aboard the White Base, a flying fortress that serves as their home, as they engage in various missions against the Principality of Zeon. Half a century has passed since the world's population began migrating to massive orbiting space colonies. All is not well, however, as a group of colonies furthest from the planet proclaims itself the Principality of Zeon and declares war on Earth.
 Half of the warring factions' populations have been destroyed and there appears to be no end in sight to this war between the Earth Federation and the Principality. An innocent civilian by the name of Amuro Ray is drawn into the conflict, and it's this young man, more specifically, his Gundam, that players control. Based upon the anime, gameplay in Mobile Suit Gundam is reminiscent of Armored Core 2, requiring players to pilot the robot-like Gundam through a number of missions ranging from guerilla attacks on enemy installations to defending a base against an onslaught of invaders.</desc>

Monster Hunter features both online and offline components, allowing players to adventure on their own or form a party, with up to three friends, for a cooperative adventure using the PS2 Network Adaptor.


 As in most role-playing games, players begin by creating a character and customizing their hero's appearance, voice and other attributes. Monster Hunter also has players creating and customizing their characters' equipment. While basic weapons and armor may be purchased from NPCs, the most powerful items in the game are made by the players' characters themselves, from the hides, teeth, scales, claws, and other parts of conquered monsters.</desc>

		<desc>Monster raising and creature contests move into the 128-bit generation as the popular Tecmo series sets up shop on the PlayStation 2 in this release of Monster Rancher 3. Though many characters and places are recognizable from earlier releases in the series, monsters in this game are represented in a cel-shaded cartoon style, similar to that of the Dreamcast's Jet Grind Radio or the contemporary PS2 release Yanya Caballista featuring Gawoo.
 

As the game receives improved graphics and some additional features with its move to the more powerful console, many of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version. Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs. While some aspects of creation are random, certain albums and movies may generate creatures specifically related to the artistic content on the disk.</desc>

This game improves upon previous installments by allowing more than one monster to be raised at once, interaction with the main character and the monsters, improved explorations, a customizable ranch, tag-team battles, improved 2P mode, a re-vamped battle system, and more detailed monsters. This game also features the longest most involved storyline of any Monster Rancher game to date.

Your goal is to raise monsters to win in-game tournaments, explore for items, and improve your ranch. You can also test your raising skills by battling your monsters against a friend in 2P mode.

The game still uses the innovative system of having a player insert music CDs, game discs, or DVDs into the PS2 to be read and used in making monsters. If you have a good sized collection of music, games, or movies, you can have access to a large variety of monsters very fast.</desc>

The game features a new 3D engine to support the familiar combination of weapon and hand-to-hand combat, but moves are now based on real-life martial arts styles, such as Crane, Snake, Tai Chi, Tae Kwon Do, Muay Thai, Tang Soo Doo, and more. Fighting styles can be switched at any time during a match, and the damage a character receives will be visible on his or her face, body, clothing, or movements.



 Returning characters from the best-selling series include Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Cyrax, Jax, Raiden, Sonya, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Quan Chi, and Reptile. Characters making their debut in Deadly Alliance include a female counterpart for Sub-Zero, a blind samurai, and a masked tribal warrior. Arenas take place in fully 3D environments, fraught with spiked pits, pools of acid, and other deadly hazards. New special moves and gruesome fatalities will also be included as the franchise makes its debut on the next-generation systems.</desc>

Holding down the accelerate button will eventually tire out racers, so players need to be judicious or they'll get bonked early and won't have enough juice to pull off any sick stunts when they sky over extreme jumps.

 Players can choose from six riders, including American phenom Keith Hamilton, and a host of different bikes. There are four game modes from which to choose: Stopwatch mode, which focuses on speed; Challenge mode, which concentrates on specific feats; Arcade mode, which is all about pulling off tricks, and Freedom mode, which lets players ride each landscape unconstrained by time limits.</desc>

There is a variety of modes to choose from: exhibition, dynasty mode, mini-games, tournament, online play, coach mode, and a scenario editor. Like many other college sports games of its time, you are put into a school of your choice, and you must  play the games, manage your roster, and recruit new players. Due to licensing issues, certain teams and stadiums are not available, but you still have many to choose from. In this game, you can use the new "rock and fire" pitch, which involves rotating the left analog stick. Batting is mainly controlled with the right analog stick. You can also use the traditional controls seen in most MLB baseball games by EA. The scenario editor allows you to put your baseball team into many situations to practice strategies. The mini-games and in-game tutorial videos help you learn the strategies on both offense and defense. Mike Patrick and Kyle Peterson are back as the commentators from the last installment, and give you the play-by-play for each game.</desc>

		<desc>Myst III: Exile is the third title in the Myst series of graphic adventure puzzle video games. While the preceding games in the series, Myst and Riven, were produced by Cyan Worlds and published by BrÃ¸derbund, Exile was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on four compact discs for both Mac OS and Microsoft Windows on May 8, 2001; versions for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were released in late 2002.

As in previous games, the player assumes the role of the Stranger, a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book.

The creators of the Myst franchise gave the task of creating the third Myst game to Presto Studios, known for its adventure game series The Journeyman Project. Presto sought to develop a diverse and logical approach to puzzles and Ages, and worked to make the villain sympathetically multifaceted.</desc>

		<name>Naruto : Ultimate Ninja</name>
		<desc>Based off Masashi Kishimoto's manga and anime Naruto, Ultimate Ninja is the first installment of the Ultimate Ninja series, known in Japan as the Narutimate Hero series. It is a fighting game with cel-shaded graphics resembling figures straight out of the manga. Ultimate Ninja contains twelve characters from the show, each with their own unique movesets and special attacks. In the overseas versions, two more bonus characters were added: Curse Mark Sasuke and Nine-Tailed Naruto. These were already playable in the Japanese version as a stronger mode for the regular characters, but split off into separate characters for the other versions. As such, the base characters cannot transform into these variations in the versions released outside of Japan.

The characters can fight in several locations seen in the show and comics, such as Hidden Leaf Village, the Chunin Exam arena, and the Forest of Death. There is a main story mode with six battles and dialogue between the characters.</desc>

		<desc>Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2 invites gamers back into the brawl as they work their way through three modes of play alone or with friends. Following the single-player storyline, gamers lead Naruto through 16 stages of combat located in the woods, on the water, among temple ruins, and on the streets of an Asian city. In each battle players earn cash and experience points. While gamers may spend experience to increase speed, agility, or defense, the cash is spent on voice samples, character models, video clips. Players may also perfect their moves in the "Practice" zone before fighting friends in "Vs." mode with characters including Gara, Kiba, Rock Lee, and Sasake.</desc>

		<name>Naruto : Uzumaki Chronicles</name>
		<desc>Taking characters, enemies, locations, and moves directly from the Cartoon Network series, Naruto: Uzumaki Chronicles gives gamers the chance to take the role of Naruto, a young ninja-in-training. Players navigate Naruto through such environments as Hidden Leaf Village to face and defeat the evil threatening Naruto's hometown. Gamers may defeat enemies with close-range combos and attacks, or with long-range weapons including shuriken and explosive cards, and by charging the power meter, players can unlock such special moves as Kagebunshin no Jutsu and Rasengan.
 Defeating a pre-determined amount of enemies launches the protagonist into a violent "berserker" mode, and allows Naruto to execute deadlier attacks. Gamers may upgrade their character by selecting from a variety of different skill cards that increase power, moves, and life. Other avatars including Sasuke, Neji, and Chouji fight along side Naruto from time to time, and when the spirit meter is full, players may switch between members in the group until the spirit level is back at zero.</desc>

		<name>Naruto Shippuden : Ultimate Ninja 4</name>
		<desc>Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 4 is the first game in the series that moves into the Shippuden storyline. The newly added "Master Mode" tells an original story that takes place during Naruto's journey with Jiraiya and is centered around a demon named Black Shadow who demands human sacrifices from a nearby village. After this is resolved the mode continues with Shippuden's regular Kazekage story arc.

The "Master Mode" features a small but open game world for the player to explore. Naruto can collect items, fight enemies and talk to people in order to progress. However, the actual fighting remains to be the core of the Ultimate Ninja experience and was more refined and expanded in Ultimate Ninja 4. When two opponents clash, they will begin a series of high-speed attacks, appearing as a pair of blurs flashing across the stage. The winner is determined by a game similar to that of Rock, Paper, Scissors. There is also the addition of "Awakening Jutsu", a technique that is more powerful than the standard Ultimate Jutsu and, as the name implies, "awakens" a character's hidden powers and can only be used when certain conditions are met.</desc>

		<name>NASCAR 09</name>
		<desc>NASCAR 09 is the twelfth installment in the EA Sports NASCAR series, it is the sequel to 2007 game NASCAR 08. It is developed by EA Tiburon and released on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and mobile phones in North America on June 10, 2008.[1] On March 12, 2008, EA announced Jeff Gordon as the cover athlete for NASCAR 09.[2] Through the career mode, "Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup", Gordon leads a mentoring program,[3] a new feature offered in NASCAR 09.[4] This is also the third EA Sports NASCAR video game to appear on a handheld system for Mobile phone version.

In October 2007, Electronic Arts moved the PlayStation 2 game development to a new studio in North Carolina to be able to get better information with the NASCAR teams in an attempt to improve the game. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game were still made at the old studio.[5]

Due to the development team using certain resources to work on key features in the game, no car manufacturers were present in this year's title.[6]

To date, this is the last NASCAR game to be produced by EA, and the last NASCAR game for the PlayStation 2, after suffering from slumping sales, the difficulty of installing new features, and the lack of popularity. In 2009, NASCAR Kart Racing was released, replacing any 2009 installment for the annual series. It may be EA's last game before their exclusive license with NASCAR expires. Yet the door to NASCAR games for the PlayStation 2 has been shut, as Polyphony Digital's Gran Turismo 5 was not featured for the sixth-generation console.

For game players in Canada, while the game was still released only in English, the instruction manual and box cover were bilingual, with text in both English and French.</desc>

The game also has a career mode, season mode, Lightning Challenge mode, SpeedZone, as well as a tutorial mode featuring Richard Petty. The game is an EA Sports Bio game, and is compatible with other EA Sports Bio games like Madden NFL 2004 and NCAA Football 2004.[3] A Nintendo GameCube port was planned but was cancelled, as the console did not support Online Play.</desc>

The life mode has the player take control of an NBA rookie right out of college and just being drafted. As in the MLB Show series, the player may only control one character and cannot control others on their team or make any management decisions. The player's role of the team will be determined by their performance on and off the court. The better the player is at playing basketball and being a teammate, the more likelier they will be a huge part of the team and receive better contracts and endorsement deals.</desc>

		<desc>NBA 2K7 is a basketball simulation video game developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports. It is the eighth installment in the NBA 2K franchise and the successor to NBA 2K6. It was released in September 2006 for Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 3. Shaquille O'Neal is the cover athlete of the game. NBA 2K7 is the predecessor to NBA 2K8 in the NBA 2K series.

The game strives to simulate the experience of the National Basketball Association and attempts to be as realistic as possible. Players play NBA basketball games with real life teams in a variety of game modes. Players may customize the gameplay, as well as the players, and can take control of an NBA team as the general manager, hiring coaches, and making a profit. The game features all the main aspects found in the NBA, such as commentary, realistic crowd animations, and halftime shows. The game's overall gameplay, as well as the aesthetics, was said to have been significantly improved before release.

NBA 2K7 received a positive reception upon release. A lot of praise was directed at the game's overall presentation; some critics called the visuals "gorgeous", while others said it was "spectacular" and achieved great "visual feats". Most other praise was directed at the game's improved gameplay, as well as the depth and wealth of content. Some negative comments were made concerning the models and animations of the players.</desc>

It was released in October 2007 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 3. Chris Paul is the cover athlete of the game. NBA 2K8 is the predecessor to NBA 2K9 in the NBA 2K series.

NBA 2K8 was well received upon release. Critics mostly praised the aesthetical details, with particular praise directed towards the player animations, as well as the game mode options, and overall gameplay, more specifically, the post play, jump shooting, and well rounded accessibility. Most criticisms were concerning some gameplay inconsistencies, such as the defensive mechanics, and the unrealistic player tendencies, as well as the game's lack of improvements, with some seeing the lack of meaningful changes as a step back from NBA 2K7, and visuals, which some saw as "awful" and "ugly". Some saw the visuals as "gorgeous" however.</desc>

Another feature is Freestyle Air, with more control of players in the air, and the option to specify 10 different freestyle configurations. You can build your team over multiple seasons, and additional management in the Dynasty Mode is introduced through rookie scouting, along with a calendar to mark all the important dates. Management is based on dynasty points. By progressing, you earn points that can be spent on training sessions, new equipment, or to send out scouts all over the world.

Different multiplayer options are offered, and events include a NBA all-star weekend with a Slam Dunk contest, a Rookie/Sophomore game and a 3-Point shootout, next to the regular game modes. You can also go freestyle anywhere in North America. The game has become quicker than the 2004 version, and the game strategies have been balanced by creating more emphasis on the mid-range jumper.</desc>

Take control of a full coaching career from inception at a small time college working your way up to a major powerhouse performer.  You can also play a skirmish with a friend, go out for a two-on-two game, or one of many other play modes you would expect in a competitive basketball game.  Just don't play it like the NBA... the college game has a different, more team-oriented feel, and this comes through in the gameplay.</desc>

		<name>NCAA Football 2002</name>
		<desc>NCAA Football was an American football video game series developed by EA Sports in which players control and compete against current Division I FBS college teams. The series is a younger brother to the Madden NFL series.

In July 2013, the NCAA announced that it would not renew its licensing contract with Electronic Arts because of an ongoing legal dispute regarding the use of player likenesses in the games. However, this contract only covers the use of the NCAA name and related logos, not those of individual schools and conferences, which are negotiated individually or through the Collegiate Licensing Company. The CLC concurrently announced that it would extend its existing licensing deal with EA through 2017, ensuring that EA Sports could continue the series without the NCAA branding.[1] However, the series was placed on hiatus in September 2013, following three major conferences pulling their trademark licenses from EA, and uncertainties surrounding the results of lawsuits involving the use of player likenesses in-game. However, EA Sports is still making an attempt to get the series back going.[2]</desc>

Modes include Scrimmage, Bowl Season, Tournament Season, Career Mode, Tournament Mode, Practice Mode, and Athletic Department. Scrimmage is an exhibition game between two teams. Bowl Season and Tournament Season let the player play a regular season and if their team is good enough for the post season, they can then participate in a bowl game or a tournament playoff, depending on the mode respectively. Career Mode lets the player take on the role of a coach. The goal is to have a good season at a small school, in hopes of either getting promoted or getting a job offer from a bigger school. Tournament Mode lets the player compete in a tournament right from the start. Practice Mode lets the player hone their skills. The Athletic Department mode allows the player to view rosters, recruit players, and create walk-on players.</desc>

		<desc>Electronic Art's 2004 incarnation of the NCAA Basketball franchise comes with some brand new features. With a sophisticated play calling system you can call your plays with still moving the ball down the court to get your team mates in contention. The dynasty mode goes up to 30 years with a recruiting system that keeps up to date of your prospects while keeping your other players in line just in case they decide to stray from their studies or worse. You can play one on one against the computer or against a buddy, playing in custom tournaments, rivalry games or even play as your favorite teams mascots. It also features the all-new Pontiac College Classics, allowing you to recreate classic games from the past or even rewrite history. The game also features the voices of Brad Nessler and the legendary Dick Vitale.</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay is based upon rival street racing crews. Players run a crew and can hire specific street racers to be in their crew and the active friendly racer is known as a wingman. Each hirable street racer has two skills, one which is a racing skill (scout, blocker, and drafter) and a non-race skill (fixer, mechanic, and fabricator). Each skill has different properties from finding hidden alleys/back streets (shortcuts) to reducing police attention. Cars driven by the wingmen are also different; blockers drive muscles, drafters drive exotics and scouts drive tuners (although the first two unlockable wingmen (Neville and Sal) drive cars according to the player's chosen car class at the start of the game). In career mode, players have to race tracks and win to conquer territories and face off against bosses to conquer districts.</desc>

		<name>Need for Speed : Hot Pursuit 2</name>
		<desc>The Need for Speed series returns, this time reverting back to the 'chase' arcade experience instead of a racing simulation. Top speed racing is the name of the game, where you must outchase not just the opposing drivers, but the cops.

Choose from a selection of today's (and yesterday's) top sports cars, including the Ferrari F50, Porsche 911 and a range from the likes of Ford, Corvette, BMW, Lotus, Mercedes, Aston Martin, the McLaren F1 and a lot more.

The competitive race mode allows you to take on other drivers and beat them to the line. A selection of tracks allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks.

The Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops. They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.</desc>

		<name>Need for Speed : Most Wanted</name>
		<desc>The player arrives in Rockport City, driving a racing version of the BMW M3 GTR (E46). Following Mia Townsend (played by Josie Maran), the player proves his driving prowess as he is pursued by a veteran police officer named Sergeant Cross (played by Dean McKenzie), who vows to take down the player and end street racing in Rockport.
Races seem to be in the player's favor until a particular group of racers, led by the game's antagonist, Clarence "Razor" Callahan (played by Derek Hamilton), sabotages and win the player's car in a race.

Without a car to escape in, the player is arrested by Cross, but is later released due to lack of evidence. Mia picks up the player and then informs the player about Razor's new status on the Blacklist, a group of 15 drivers most wanted by the Rockport Police Department. She then helps by assisting the player in acquiring a new car and working his way up the Blacklist. Rivals are defeated one by one, and the player is rewarded with reputation, new rides, and ride improvements with every Blacklist member taken down. 
As new boroughs are opened up throughout Rockport (Rosewood, Camden Beach, and Downtown Rockport), Mia also sets up safehouses for the player to lie low in, in exchange for placement of "side bets" on the player's races.</desc>

		<name>Need for Speed : ProStreet</name>
		<desc>Need for Speed: ProStreet is the eleventh installment of Electronic Arts' popular racing game series Need for Speed. On May 21, 2007, Electronic Arts published a teaser trailer of ProStreet, and officially announced it ten days later.[3] It was released worldwide in November 2007.[1] ProStreet includes more than 40 cars including a few from American Le Mans Series. ProStreet was the first PlayStation 3 game with DualShock 3 rumble support.

The demo, featuring two races, one speed challenge and one grip race, appeared on Xbox Live on October 26, 2007, on PlayStation Store on November 1, 2007, and on PC on November 2, 2007. The PC version is the last in the series to use CD-ROMs, which are succeeded by the usage of DVDs for the rest of the series. ProStreet is preceded by Need for Speed: Carbon and is followed by Need for Speed: Undercover.</desc>

		<name>Need for Speed : Undercover</name>
		<desc>Need for Speed Undercover has players racing through speedways, dodging cops and chasing rivals as they go deep undercover to take down an International crime syndicate. The game heralds the return of high-intensity police chases and introduces the all-new 'Heroic Driving Engine' -- a unique technology that generates incredible high-performance moves at 180 miles per hour during breathtaking highway battles. A mix of computer graphics and live-action movies immerses gamers in the rich world of the Tri-City Bay Area. The cityâ€™s open-world environment features over 80 miles of roads, including an enormous highway system that sets the stage for highway battles. These high-speed, high-stake chase sequences push players to the limit as they fight off cops and opponents while whipping through traffic at 180 miles per hour. An intelligent new A.I. mechanic delivers a realistic and high-energy action driving experience. Going back to the franchiseâ€™s roots, Need for Speed Undercover features more aggressive and intelligent cops whose sole purpose is to take down the player quickly and by any means necessary. Need for Speed Undercover also features the series' signature car customization, real-world damage and realistic driving physics. The game includes some of the hottest licensed cars such as the Audi R8, BMW M6 and Lexus IS-F.</desc>

The prologue begins with the player driving in a Nissan Skyline R34 in Olympic City (though the racing scenes are actually in Bayview), the setting of NFS:UG. He then receives a race challenge from a rather ominous personality who offers him a spot on his crew, but "won't take 'no' for an answer." The player races off â€” despite Samantha's warnings â€” only to be ambushed by a mysterious driver in a rage that totals his Skyline. The driver, who has a unique scythe tattoo, makes a call confirming the accident, and the flashback fades out.</desc>

		<desc>Play a full season with your favorite team or try the franchise mode and build a legacy. You can even create teams and players.

In general manager mode, when you go into the off-season, several different things happen. First, you'll see a list of players who have retired from your team and the reasons they've left, which are usually related to injuries or diminishing skills. If you lose some key players, then you'll need to make every effort to ensure that those positions are filled by free agents with similar skills or rookies who have solid potential. You're frequently stuck with trying your luck in the draft, where you can select a rookie based on how you finished the season, like in the real NFL draft. GameDay has a feature that gives you a breakdown on the draft and provides you with an overall rating for each rookie. Following the draft, you have to sign your rookies with whatever cap money you've set aside for that purpose. When you're all done, it's time to start the next season.</desc>

This NFL adaptation boasts a comprehensive franchise mode that introduces some innovations in this standard mode.  One of these is a draft ticker, which puts your team on the clock each time it selects a player in the draft. With the draft ticker on, it is important to scout college players beforehand and analyze draft positions and team needs in order to preselect your team's draft candidates. In simulated games, NFL Primetime gives a variety of coach options. Here you can customize your team's aggressiveness level in offense and blitz tendencies and even set spies on more mobile quarterbacks for simulated games. Naturally, there are also obvious franchise mode options such as the ability to draft, trade, and sign/release free agents over multiple seasons.</desc>

		<name>NHL 06</name>
		<desc>New rules and updated rosters and season schedules feature in this update of the longrunning NHL series, as do many new features.

Deking is now performed using the left analog stick, with swift signature moves of star players that confuse opponents and reward skill. The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull's-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the players' momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts.

With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for "face sculpting" - changing the different features.

All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete, with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team.

The PC, PS2 and Xbox version support online multiplayer games, and as a special bonus, the original NHL 94 game, one of the first in the series, has been included with the PS2 edition.</desc>

		<desc>NHL 2002 is EA's latest incarnation of their NHL series.

New features over previous years includes the "Breakaway Cam", which causes the game to slow down, turn blue, and go into letterbox mode when you're one on one with the goalie, and "EA GameStory", which tracks your progress and rewards you for outstanding performance.

NHL 2002 is the first in the series to include NHL Cards, which is the equiviliant of Madden's NFL Cards. By performing special moves, such as scoring within the first 30 seconds or winning 10 face-offs, you get points, which you can then use to buy cards.

NHL 2002 includes all the professional NHL teams, as well as the International teams, such as Team Canada and U.S.A. Every stadium is included, and so is every player.

NHL 2002 has many game modes, including Season, Quick Play, Shootout, and Exhibition. It also has a "Create-A-Skater" mode.</desc>

		<desc>The control for NHL 2004 has been refined, allowing for more precise movement than in the previous games. Precise passes, shots, and accurate skating are accomplished by simply tapping the button.

NHL 2004 features a new fighting engine, allowing for more accurate and realistic fights. The right analog stick controls "Bruise Control", which lets you perform different moves by tilting the stick in different directions. Before you get into fights, you'll need to agitate a player, and this is where his Agitation Meter comes in. Losing the game, being checked, making sloppy passes all raises his Agitation Meter, until he is ready to burst and will fight at the slightest poke check.</desc>

		<desc>The graphics have been even more improved from last year. Now the 'cyber players' look so close to their real life counterparts that their hard to distinguish. Player models are updated with more life like skin, hair and features. This includes more facial animations and emotions. The coaches are also redone in this manner. The in-game meanwhile adds a whole slew of new animations, cutscenes, goalie animations and enhancements to the fighting engine.

In the control department, NHL 2005 adds a new feature called Open-Ice control. This feature lets you potentially control players without the puck, set up for picks, double team and more. Shooting wrist shots and slap shots are also now mapped to separate buttons for more flexibility.

The gameplay introduces a new feature as personalities for players. Such that a player like Tie Domi will play more like an enforcer, while Markus Naslund will rely more on finesse and skill. You will be relied on to balance this personalities on each line of a team to create chemistry. The dynasty mode has been redone with a new interface and tweaks. Free Agency and Trading has been tweaked along with the handling of a team. The new system allows you to keep up to date on weekly injuries/streaks reports, letters from your owner, players, etc.</desc>

All the standard game modes are here, from exhibition games and playoff games, to a very in depth Franchise mode that gives you complete control over your team. You act as the general manager, coach, scout and player. You can negotiate contracts, make trades, and draft rookies.

On the ice, you have a lot of control over your team as well. You can anchor lines with key players, rotate your lines to always be matched up, and make sure you have the advantage every which way.</desc>

The franchise mode was extended, allowing more control of the team during the offseason (such as improvements in the draft and in negotiations), as well as tweaks to player progression and other changes to improve the realism of post-lockout NHL management - waivers, salary cap management, free agents and more. On the ice, while the game remains mostly unchanged, the new Superstar Moves bring a spark of world class hockey to the game, particularly on breakaways and penalty shots.</desc>

It was released on September 25, 2003, for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox. Unlike the previous titles in the series, this game has 5-on-5 gameplay instead of the usual 3-on-3 gameplay with the earlier titles. Despite that fact, however, the game does not include penalty shots, and it is still an arcade-type hockey game like its predecessors. It also has, as the name suggests, a lot of hard hitting, appealing more often to casual hockey fans than hardcore ones. The cover athlete of the game is Nicklas LidstrÃ¶m, and features commentary from Tim Kitzrow[1] and Harry Teinowitz.

Unlike many other hockey video games of the 21st century, NHL Hitz Pro had the IIHF license, enabling it to use the jerseys of the Olympic hockey teams.

The game also has many game modes, one of the most popular being the "Pick-Up Hockey" game mode, where the game would turn into either a roller, street, or pond hockey match-up between two amateur teams.</desc>

		<desc>THQ's tiny tribal shaman returns for another series of adventures, this time on a quest to rid the world of four giant "Grosstrosities" that he accidentally unleashed. The series' traditional platforming has been supplemented with a new "parkour" style that lets Tak run up walls, slide down poles, and swing on vines, all while trying to rid the world of the Stink Giant, the Slime Giant, the Landfill Giant, and the Molten Cheese Giant. There are a handful of stench-themed mini-games in each level, gamers can control Jeera through a special jungle-driving level, and as always, players collect "juju" magic spells to help ward off enemies.</desc>

Professor Calamitousfuels his army by feeding fairies krabby patties. This makes them emit a gas that, when mixed with ghost energy, can fuel robots. When Patrick Star and SpongeBob SquarePants deliver a large amount of krabby patties to a house, they are all sucked up and accidentally Patrick is taken along. After selecting a character, players traverse the insides of Professor Calamitous' toy factory to fight evil robot copies of themselves.</desc>

		<desc>In this turn-based dungeon crawler you play as Gil, whose beloved fiancee has been kidnapped by a sorceress and taken to the Tower of Druaga. Gil puts on a suit of armor that radiates light, and proceeds into the dungeon to save his beloved Ki.

The combat system and exploration might be the best part of the game. The map is set up in a grid, and you do everything in turns, like moving, battling, or recovering. The timing of moves is also critical, and the game feels like a real-time game because you aren't waiting like you typically would for turn-based games.

The Nightmare of Druaga: Fushigino dungeon is a collaboration between the Mysterious Dungeon series and the arcade classic The Tower of Druaga.</desc>

		<desc>The Nakatomi company is searching for the pieces of the Akujiki sword, shattered by Hotsuma in the predecessor, Shinobi. Luckily, the Oboro ninja clan has since reformed. As Hibana, kunoichi (female ninja) of the Oboro clan, you are charged with the task of finding the pieces of the Akujiki before Nakatomi does.
 As a rift reopens between this world and the realms of evil, the svelte and stealthy Hibana must battle demons from beyond to save the people of Tokyo. The heroine's ninja skills are matched with a deep understanding of the mystic arts, making her the last, best hope to keep the city safe and the evil contained.
 While Nightshade's gameplay is similar to that of Sega's 2002 version of Shinobi (also developed by OverWorks), the kunoichi Hibana may perform a number of new special attacks never known to her male counterpart. Shadow dancing, she defeats powerful foes with flashy finesse. An enhanced "Tate" system allows unlimited combos, and filling her "Chakra Gauge" allows Hibana to perform powerful ninja magic.</desc>

There is career mode where the player can unlock new characters and bikes by winning these events and a six-player online capability.  The controls mostly consist of using the Wii remote to steer and accelerate as well as boosting with the nitro rocket.  There is also a four-player bowling game where players can hurl their rider at a set of huge bowling pins.</desc>

		<desc>Nobunaga's Ambition: Iron Triangle is another entry in KOEI's long-running series of grand strategy games. As in the previous instalments, the player assumes the role of a Japanese feudal lord during the famous Sengoku period (from the XV to the XVII century).

The main game screen shows an overhead 3D rendered view of the landscape, showing buildings and moving armies belonging to each clan. The player gives orders using a menu with a list of commands, that branch out with several options: City (to construct buildings), Personnel (to employ officers), Military (to move and attack with the army), Strategy, Diplomacy (to negotiate treaties and exchange technology) and others to review the resources. The game is paused while issuing the orders, and they are only executed when in Active mode, where time passes and seasons change.</desc>

		<name>Okage : Shadow King</name>
		<desc>Okage: Shadow King is an RPG with a slight twist: it's humorous.

The game's premise is that a boy (nameable by the player with the default name of Ari) makes a deal with an evil spirit to cure his sister of a curse that's caused her to speak entirely in pig Latin. The spirit, Evil King Stanley Hihat Trinidad XIV (or Stan for short), assumes the role of your shadow and orders you to track down the lost remnants of his power, which have been siphoned away by impostor Evil Kings over the last few thousand years while he was trapped in a bottle. And, while you're at it, Stan would also like you to help him take over the world.

The game plays similarly to most JRPGs. Ari will visit towns and fight (turn based) battles against monsters - which in this game happen to be things like wild cows and man eating onions. Party members level up and gain new skills as they gain experience. Ari can respond to the story and other characters with a number of different dialogue options, such as a nice response, a rude response, or a silly response, and how he acts will affect how different party members feel about him.</desc>

		<desc>The game is set in a Nippon (Japan) based on Japanese folklore, and begins with a flashback to events 100 years prior to the game's present; the narrator describes how Shiranui, a pure white wolf, and Nagi, a swordsman, together fought the eight-headed demon Orochi to save Kamiki Village and the maiden Nami, Nagi's beloved. Shiranui and Nagi are unable to defeat Orochi, but manage to seal the demon away.
 In the game's present, Susano, a descendant of Nagi and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, breaks Orochi's seal due to the fact that he does not believe in the legend and wants to prove it false; Orochi escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from every living being. Sakuya, the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and pleads for her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist Issun (an inch-high creature known as a Poncle), Amaterasu is able to restore the land to its former beauty.</desc>

As players explore the dark cityscapes, warehouses, research labs, and other dwellings of the Syndicate, they will confront numerous armed guards loyal to Boss Muro, the sole leader of the oppressive establishment.

		<name>Onimusha</name>
		<desc>Onimusha: Warlords is set in 16th century Japan during the period of the civil war dominated by Nobunaga Oda. You play Samanosuke Akechi, who dies during an attempt to stop the kidnapping of young princess Yuki, the sister to Yoshitatsu Saito. However, Akechi is given another chance at life, and is handed the gauntlet of the Ogres. 

With this new power Samanosuke must fight through the monster-filled halls of Inabayama Castle. As monsters are defeated, their souls are absorbed by the gauntlet, increasing its power. Some souls restore Samanosuke's health and magic, while others can be used to power up weapons, armor, and items. Powering up weapons will increase their damage and the strength of their associated magic, and is also required to pass by special locks throughout the castle. Items will need to be found in one part of the castle to unlock doors or otherwise bypass obstacles elsewhere in the castle, and sometimes the player will take control of Samanosuke's companion Kaede while Samanosuke is incapacitated in some way. Kaede can reach some locations that are beyond Samanosuke as well as pick locks and throw kunai, but she can not absorb souls or open any lock intended for the wearer of the Ogre gauntlet.</desc>

		<desc>Another village has been brutalized by a host of ghastly creatures. Ten years after Samanosuke Akechi battled a resurrected demon lord in Onimusha, Nobunaga has returned to terrify and oppress innocents across the country. Fortunately a young samurai, Jubei Yagyu, has noticed the spread of evil and resolved to battle the demonic forces wherever he finds them.
 The famous Japanese actor Yusaku Matsuda, best known in the U.S. for the 1989 movie Black Rain, was the model for Jubei Yagyu. Matsuda died in 1989 of cancer, but returns for a starring role in Onimusha 2. Capcom also hired Keita Amamiya as character designer, director, and illustrator to insure a high-quality product. Onimusha 2 includes twice as many cut-scenes as the original, and the quality of these cut-scenes has been dramatically improved. Action stars were hired to add additional realism.</desc>

This PS2 version of the grueling contest boasts realistic physics, a variety of racing vehicles, and authentically modeled 3D environments. While virtual drivers must often adopt an "anything goes" approach as they speed ahead through the diverse, unpredictable, off-road environments, skill and strategy must be employed to avoid hazards and keep the vehicle running smoothly.
 Even minor abuses build up over the two-week contest. Barreling through too many potholes can ruin a suspension. Those tumbleweeds seem light and insignificant, but hitting too many off them might crack the windshield. As in the real-life race, an important part of the game is managing the little details to keep the car and its driver moving ahead across the long haul.</desc>

		<name>Peter Jackson's King Kong : The Official Game of the Movie</name>
		<desc>Based on award-winning director Peter Jackson's big-budget remake of the landmark 1933 Cooper and Schoedsack film, this video game version of King Kong is designed to convey the action and excitement the massive monster inspires, as well as the poignancy and emotion of the melancholy "beauty and the beast" storyline.
 Gameplay comes in two styles: In control of the ambitious hero Jack Driscoll, players fight for their own survival from a first-person perspective; while in the empowering role of the mighty Kong himself, players have a third-person perspective that allows them to take in their surroundings, and take better control the massive ape in battle. Developed in conjunction with Jackson and his production company, the game also features scenes and locations not seen in the film.</desc>

You start with the host of the show, Xzibit, lending you his car, and you must go out into in a five borough area called 'Pimp City'. At this point, you can take part in various mini games throughout Pimp City in order to earn money and buy your own car, and then pimp it.

While pimping your ride, Pimp My Ride's host Xzibit will be on hand to help you. Once you have completed your car's pimping out, you can take your new looking ride out for a spin into Pimp City, essentially turning the game into a free roaming racer, and earn money and complete various challenges and races in order to progress through the game.</desc>

 Players take the role of Francis Blade, who stumbles upon the magic amulet of the "Black Buccaneer" while marooned on a desert island. Much more than a sinisterly shaped hunk of gold, the amulet is bound to the ghostly essence of the frightening rouge for whom it is named, and coveys to its bearer both his magic powers and his ruinous curse. Francis embarks on an epic journey to save his new ghostly companion -- as well as himself -- from eternal damnation.</desc>

		<name>Pitfall : The Lost Expedition</name>
		<desc>Twenty-two years after making his groundbreaking debut on the Atari 2600, Activision's Pitfall Harry returns for more jungle-exploring action. The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original, players must utilize Harry's athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment.

His objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can't conquer with a well-timed jump or two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character's single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body.


As the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the "Hero's Handbook" and Harry's off to adventure. The "Hero's Handbook's" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are. Find new pages, and Harry will learn new moves.</desc>

		<desc>The third title in the Prince of Persia series' 128bit generation revival, The Two Thrones offers action gamers a chance to play two different personifications of the noble young Babylonian. In the role of the good Prince, familiar from recent adventures, players will use agility, speed, and cunning to outfight and outwit enemies across the expansive, freely roamed city. Through the great struggles he has faced, however, a more vicious, unforgiving side of the Prince has developed from deep within his psyche, and it may no longer be contained. Players will also control this "Dark Prince," a bitter warrior of deadly efficiency, with a completely different set of fighting moves and abilities.</desc>

		<desc>Seven years after the events of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, the Prince finds himself constantly hunted by a terrible beast known as the Dahaka. The Prince seeks counsel from an old wise man who explains that whoever releases the Sands of Time must die. Because the Prince escaped his fate, it is the Dahaka's mission as guardian of the Timeline to ensure that he dies as he was meant to. The old man also tells of the Island of Time, where the Empress of Time first created the Sands. The Prince sets sail for the Island in an attempt to prevent the Sands from ever being created, an act he believes will appease the Dahaka. After a battle at sea with an enemy force led by a mysterious woman in black capsizes the Prince's ship, the Prince washes ashore unconsciously onto the Island of Time.</desc>

As part of his academic "studies," Raz must enter classmates' minds to solve their problems, ranging from childhood trauma to borderline personality disorders. Accomplishing these feats involves using the character's unusual talents to manipulate the strange worlds created by the subject's mind.
 Raz literally walks through an individual's fears, delusions, and rage to solve various object-oriented puzzles and to eliminate potential threats. The human brain guards itself against foreigners poking around the subconscious and will manufacture enemies and barriers to stop Raz before he can resolve whatever psychological ailment is plaguing the host. Among the special powers Raz can call upon are invisibility, confusion, mind control, psychic blasts, and telekinesis.</desc>

 In R-Type Final, your enemy is the Bydo, an evil (and living) weapon capable of reproducing itself. Humanity has fought the Bydo four times so far, and each time was victorious. However, each time the Bydo appears it is stronger than before, and now it's back and you need to destroy it again!</desc>

		<desc>Radiata Stories is a traditionally styled Japanese console RPG, featuring endearing young heroes who face epic challenges in a fantasy realm. The game's lighthearted story follows two main characters, Jack and Ridley, who had longed all their lives to become knights and protect the kingdom of Radiata with heroism and pride.
 Now that they have finally earned their knighthood, however, they find themselves facing the most terrible war the land has ever known, and they must wonder if there might be another way to resolve this conflict that suddenly threatens the entire world.
 The design of Radiata Stories focuses on placing the player in a living, responsive world, where each of the more than 175 non-player characters lives a unique life, following a natural daily routine and offering a distinct perspective when players by stop for a conversation.</desc>

		<desc>Ratchet &amp; Clank  involves the two protagonists Ratchet, a furry alien creature, and Clank, a nerdy little robot, going on a quest to find Captain Qwark and ultimately to help save the galaxy.
Firstly each of the game's levels are huge sweeping vistas with extremely detailed buildings which are visible at all times. This means that a building on the horizon is not just a backdrop; in all likelihood Ratchet will be exploring it in a few moments time. Secondly, the game includes a number of sub-games, such as a space fight sequence and a number of turret shoot-outs which are akin to Missile Command in the first person.
The game has over twenty levels and includes as many real-time cut-scenes which tell the story. The story is non-linear, requiring the player to return to previous levels to complete objectives and to choose between multiple paths forward. There is also a respectable array of weapons, gadgets, and accessories to find or buy as the game progresses.</desc>

		<name>Ratchet : Gladiator</name>
		<desc>Ratchet: Deadlocked is the fourth game in the Ratchet &amp; Clank series by Insomniac Games. The storyline involves Ratchet and Clank, along with Al, being kidnapped and forced to compete in a underground reality show called "DreadZone" run by the media mogul Gleeman Vox on the outer fringes of the galaxy. 

The game differs from its predecessors in that it focuses more on shooting than platforming and puzzle elements. The game allows you to use two bots to fight along side you, which can be upgraded over time with better weapons and firepower. There is a total of  10 weapons in the game, significantly less than the other games. However, modding these weapons is more emphasized than before, with different kinds of Alpha and Omega mods. Omega mods can be used on any weapon, and range from the freeze mod to the magma mod. Alpha mods are weapon-specific, and increase the rate of fire, ammo capacity, and power. The game also features online multiplayer.

Clank is not a playable character in this game, although he gives advice to Ratchet over his communication link.</desc>

Civilization as you know it has collapsed and now you must make your way out of the city while staying dry and warm in a metropolis that now resembles Atlantis. Gamers may take the role of six different people and play through several different storylines as they progress through the game. Each person is influenced by the actions of another. For example, if you place supplies and clothes in a locker the next character you play can find and use those items.
 The enemy in the game is hypothermia and water. If you remain in wet clothes and out of shelter for too long your body temperature drops and you die. To combat the cold you can locate such items as dry clothes and space heaters throughout the city while you search for a way out.</desc>

While the mines itself are dangerous, so too is the mysterious plague that has broken out among the ranks of miners, killing many. Into this low morale situation, propaganda against Ultor has begun appearing, signed only by "Eos". These pamphlets and posters urge the miners to rise up against their oppressors and take a stand, also recruiting members into their secretive "Red Faction". As a result of Eos' efforts, tensions are rising high between the Ultor corporation and it's workers, any little incident could ignite...</desc>

		<name>Red Faction II</name>
		<desc>Long since the revolt from the mining of Mars, a new group has taken over Red Faction, and their sights are set on the dictator, Chancellor Sopot. Sopot originally created the Red Faction soldiers using a form of nano technology but, fearing they would fight back, ordered them to be destroyed.

As the leader of the group, your task is to take back freedom that was lost, and save your skin as well as that of those who work with you.

As was originally designed in the first Red Faction, Geo-Mod builds the world around you as a means to destroy it. Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks.

Multiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.</desc>

The PlayStation 2 version of Resident Evil -- CODE: Veronica X is similar to the original Dreamcast release in nearly every relevant way though it contains additional cut-scenes.
 Resident Evil -- CODE: Veronica X picks up where the PlayStation's Resident Evil 2 left off, in Raccoon City. There, the Umbrella Corporation performed scientific experiments that went wrong. The result of their experiments was a virus that led to the creation of a huge number of zombies as well as a variety of other creatures bent on a path of death and destruction. As members of S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad), players did the best they could to stop the Umbrella Corp.'s madness, but ultimately Raccoon City and all of its inhabitants were wiped out.</desc>

		<name>Resident Evil : Dead Aim</name>
		<desc>Resident Evil: Dead Aim, known as Gun Survivor 4: Biohazard: Heroes Never Die in Japan, is the fourth release in a series of light gun shooter video games by Capcom. It is also the first in the franchise to feature first-person shooting alongside the third-person movement seen in its predecessors in the Resident Evil series. It was developed by Capcom's Production Studio 3 and could be released for the PlayStation 2 as the company's then-effective exclusivity contract with Nintendo pertained only to numbered entries in the series.
 The Capcom series that helped establish the survival horror genre steps back into the faster-paced action of first-person shooting in Resident Evil: Dead Aim. In this Resident Evil: Survivor-style addition to the franchise, players join the dangerously brave Anti-Umbrella Pursuit Investigation Team operator Bruce McGivern as he guns down the baddies in an all-new storyline.
 Resident Evil: Dead Aim is designed to offer sharp graphics, steady action, and accessible gameplay. It supports Guncon 2 light gun controllers for a more authentic zombie-blasting experience. Remaining true to the spirit of the series, the game also features involved puzzle-solving, unsettling environments, and an abundance of creepy mutant monsters.</desc>

		<desc>Resident Evil - Outbreak takes a turn from previous outings in the survival horror series by featuring a multiplayer online component. The narrative is broken down into chapters, allowing up to four players to experience the world of Resident Evil together for the first time. Players initially choose from a lineup of eight characters, six males and two females, who each possess distinct skills or techniques. Some characters may be proficient in a specific style of weapon, while others may be able to open locked doors more efficiently.
 The choice of characters becomes important since teamwork is often needed to advance through the zombie-filled office buildings, bars, subways, and dilapidated mansions in and around the cursed Raccoon City. One player, for example, may have to distract a group of zombies, while another works on picking a lock or solving a puzzle as quickly as possible. Resident Evil: Outbreak requires a broadband connection in order to play online, but the game also features a single-player mode for those brave enough to go it alone.</desc>

Once again you find yourself playing the eight characters of the original Resident Evil: Outbreak in more scenarios set in the ruins of what used to be Raccoon City. In single player mode you select a character to play and 2 other characters to accompany you.

The new game has several new scenarios and boasts new gameplay developments for the Resident Evil series. Loading times have been reduced and while the previous Outbreak was on-line enabled in the US, this game is the first on-line Resident Evil game in Europe.

The locales featured in this game include both the familiar (The Raccoon Police Department) and the exotic (A mutated jungle at mid-day) ones. The game boasts a hefty amount of unlockable material such as artworks, notes, trivia, and character costumes.  The game is backwards compatible with your save file from Resident Evil: Outbreak, meaning that you can take your unlocked content to this new setting.</desc>

You must blast complex viruses, unlock passwords, and destroy firewall bosses as you search for Eden. Each stage is in a constant state of flux dependent on your shooting techniques, which ultimately control the music and colors of your environment. The deeper you get into the dreamlike cyber world of Rez, your form will evolve or devolve depending on your progress.</desc>

		<desc>20 years ago, an alternate World War II occurred, where both Axis and Allies developed mecha technology, known as Armored Fighting Walkers (AFWs). As a result, battles continued in different ways and Russian forces were more instrumental in the eventual defeat of Japan. The end of the war has had Japan divided between  the allied forces, similar to Germany. Japan is now split into a communist North Japan and an Democratic South Japan, governed separately. Without any obvious cause, Japan erupted into civil war between it's halves for four years. Dubbed the "Japan War", it further weakened Japan's economy and fueled resentment between people living in the North and the South. In 1964, Masami von Weizegger is a AFW pilot in the South Japan forces.

		<desc>A complete remake of the classic 1986 title Defender of the Crown (not to be confused with the "Remastered" Windows version released in 2002), in Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown the player plays as the legendary folk outlaw in his quest to reclaim the throne of England after Richard Lionheart was captured in the crusades and his brother, John Lackland, usurped the throne and left him for dead in the Holy Land, attracting the ire of several knights. In a heated argument, he considered them to be traitors, causing a civil war to start.

Several gameplay features were changed from the classic title such as the player being Robin Hood himself (instead of picking one of four pretenders), full 3D graphics, a plot included with the game and the goal being to be the first to reach and conquer King John's stronghold in Cornwall. To do so, the player must build an army large enough to hold enough shires, which generate money from taxes. This money can then be used to hire new troops (peasants, archers, footmen and the mighty knights and catapults) or pay King Richard's ransom, which allow to enlist loyalist knights.</desc>

Taking place 100 years in the future, players control the leader of an elite military force known as RTX -- short for Radical Tactics Experts. As Eugene Zeno Wheeler, cybernetic soldier, players will confront the hostile aliens using brute force, explore the environment, and solve puzzles needed to advance further into the mysterious outpost on Red Rock.
 Wheeler is not completely alone in this ten-level adventure. Chief Colony Officer Cimmeria Rajan will keep him apprised of the recent events, and a portable computer named IRIS can interface with electronic devices ranging from control panels to robots to vehicles. Once locked in, the computer module will talk to players using a female voice. Objects under IRIS' control can also be manipulated by players to solve puzzles or to access otherwise unreachable areas.</desc>

There is no story behind it. You're merely racing in one of three dozen cars (many based on real-life designs) in fifteen different tracks, ranging from airports to old mines to specially designed stunt arenas. Taking part in either races, stunt shows, or in one-on-one duels, you'll need to learn not only how to drive, but also when to use power-ups and where the best short cuts are. Power-ups include oil slicks to bombs to a tornado that cleans the course ahead of you. Through the Championship mode, you'll be able to unlock all the vehicles and tracks.</desc>

Rumble Roses features 11 scantly clad, and at times very dirty, female characters. In Mud Mode, players will take on their opponents in a mud wrestling match designed to reveal more than just wrestling expertise. Classic wrestling moves are available, such as suplexes, kicks, and flying elbows, as well as the ability for players to taunt and insult their opponents, which can provide advantages in the ring.
 A "Super Star" system can offer advantages as well, based on a character's popularity with the crowd. Players are encouraged to develop a persona for their character, and different special moves become available depending on whether they choose to fight dirty or clean in the ring.</desc>

Players take on the role of legendary warrior Rygar as he fights mythological beasts and foes throughout locales inspired by Ancient Greece. The island of Argus has plunged into chaos with the abduction of Princess Harmonia at the mighty hands of the Titans. Equipped with a multipurpose shield called the Diskarmor, Rygar sets out to free Princess Harmonia from captivity and restore peace to his home.
 As Rygar advances through shrines, coliseums, and mysterious labyrinths, he will develop new moves and abilities. Rygar can learn to slide to squeeze through narrow passageways, stomp on enemies or objects, push or lift items, and use the Diskarmor to hang from ledges, grapple onto objects and then swing across chasms. Attacks involve pressing various button combinations, the result of which vary depending on the Diskarmor's abilities at the time.

Set in Japan with hip hop feel from the hit TV series by the same name, this title allows gamers to breathe life to a "lost episode" as one of three playable characters - Mugen, a reckless samurai with break-dancing fighting style, calculated Jin who abides by the decorum of Bushido, and a mysterious new character exclusive to the video game. Stranded in northern land of Ezo (current day Hokkaido) in search of the samurai who smells of sunflowers, the player must face foreign mercenaries, master swordsmen, diabolical assassins, mythical beasts, and gangster monkeys. The core of the game's unique combat system lies in the innovative integration of music and linked attacks. The players can choose an array of combos based on the different hip hop grooves that they can swap at will. Music tracks become collectible, opening an extensive assortment of linked attacks that can be implemented tactically during combat.</desc>

		<name>Samurai Warriors</name>
		<desc>Samurai Warriors is Koei's extension of the popular Dynasty Warriors series. Instead of taking place during the Three Kingdoms era in China, Samurai Warriors takes you back to feudal Japan, during the warring states era. In the game, you take control of actual historical figures such as Yukimura Sanada, Nobunaga Oda, and Hattori Hanzo. Altogether, there are fifteen characters, ten of whom need to be unlocked.

Basically, gameplay is almost identical to that of Dynasty Warriors. The main differences are things like the inclusion of indoor castle levels, and a greater variety of enemies. In Dynasty Warriors, enemies were basically either soldiers or archers. In Samurai Warriors, there are soldiers, archers, musketeers, and many different types of ninjas. In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending. Updated graphics and a more "techno-ish" soundtrack top off the additions.</desc>

With the king's soul magically shattered, and the land in turmoil, the player is challenged to restore the throne by winning the war for one of three factions in the game - the noble Virtwyn, the mutated Chrysalis, or the necromantic Pariah.

Upon accidentally uncovering his neighbor's evil plot to take over the universe with an army of mutant lizards, Bobby "Scaler" Johnson is put in the position to infiltrate the operation and bring it down from the inside.

The enemy army is strong and diverse, however, with different mutant lizard soldier types that are well suited for various tasks.
 Luckily, after transforming from a boy into a lizard, changing from one lizard form to another eventually becomes relatively easy, and Scaler will need to assume the appearance and abilities of no fewer than five other creatures in order to accomplish all the objectives before him.</desc>

The game picks up where the movie left off, albeit with the stunning revelation that Montana isn't dead. Montana survives the assassination attempt and vows revenge on the kingpin who nearly put him out of commission: Alejandro Sosa. Players assume the role of power-hungry Montana in his bid to reclaim his cocaine empire and extravagant lifestyle. This, of course, means resorting to graphic violence and colorful profanity as a means of "persuasion."</desc>

		<name>Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights</name>
		<desc>Scooby Doo! Night of 100 Frights is loosely based upon the Scooby Doo cartoon series, and thus strays little from the show's basic formula. The Scooby Gang (consisting of Fred, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy, and of course, Scooby Doo) attempts to unravel the mystery behind a haunted mansion where Daphne's friend's scientist father was working. Controlling the lovable canine himself, players must explore 12 levels spread across four different areas in and around the mansion.
 Within each area are dozens of obstacles that require Scooby to make carefully timed jumps, activate switches, and dispatch any monsters in his path. While Scooby's primary means of offense is a jumping attack, as players progress through the adventure new powers can be found or bought, including a football helmet which enables Scooby to ram into enemies. Found strewn throughout the in-game environments are Scooby snacks. Collect the requisite number and the four-limbed protagonist will gain access to new areas. Once acquired, new items can be put to use in previously completed stages in order to unlock or discover previously hidden areas and secrets.</desc>

 Second Sight opens with John Vattic, the player-controlled lead character, as he awakens from a coma in a US medical facility where he has been subjected to traumatic surgery and experimentation.

		<desc>The year is 1929. America is threatened by a mysterious evil power. Pale green distortions in the sky, called "windows", spawn vicious monsters. Johnny Garland is a young man who has lost his family and his memory in a terrible accident. It turns out that he inherited a fortune from his father, but he is not interested in money, but in re-discovering his own past. For that reason, Johnny becomes a private investigator. He receives an assignment which involves capturing an escaped convict. During the investigation, Johnny meets Shania, a native American woman who works as a monster-hunter. From that point on, the destinies of the two are linked together...

This installment of the  Shadow Hearts series utilizes almost the same gameplay system as  Shadow Hearts: Covenant. The turn-based battles are once again controlled by the Judgment Ring: you must stop a spinning indicator on a colored segment of a ring in order to execute a successful attack. New in this game are combo attacks which the players can execute through special areas of the Judgment Ring.</desc>

		<name>Shadow of Rome</name>
		<desc>Shadow of Rome is a third-person, action-adventure game with some elements of racing. The game has two types of gameplay: close quarters combat levels involving Agrippa and stealth-based, puzzle-solving adventure levels involving Octavianus.[2] There are also levels in which Agrippa competes in chariot races.[3]
Agrippa uses various gladiator weapons to fight, including swords, maces, spears, among others.[3] Agrippa can use special moves such as "Red Volcano"â€”a move used to slice enemies in halfâ€” to please the crowds.[2] As a result, the crowd will throw down items to help Agrippa.[4] Once a weapon is used enough, it will break, and the player will have to find a new one inside the area.[3]
In Octavianus' levels, the player sneaks around various locations in Rome. Octavianus cannot kill enemies, he can only knock them out. Other ways to pass these levels are by hiding in large pots or by stealing clothes and impersonating someone.[3]</desc>

		<desc>End-level bosses are standard fare in video games, but the bosses are the levels in this unusual adventure. Developed by the studio that created the PS2's critically acclaimed Ico, Shadow of the Colossus is another fantasy-themed puzzle adventure that's light on dialog and heavy on beautifully expressive environments.
 Players take the role of a young knight who sets out to rescue his sleeping-beauty princess from a magic-induced state of suspended animation. To do so, he'll need to defeat the 16 Colossi -- landscape-sized enemies so enormous that they can only be conquered by exploring them, platform-game style, to discover their weaknesses. Against some Colossi, the hero may ride his faithful steed alongside the monster, galloping at full speed just to keep up with its mile-long strides. Other Colossi require the player to actually climb aboard, and crawl, run, and leap across their massive forms to find the hidden vulnerability that can be used to bring them down.</desc>

		<name>ShellShock : Nam '67</name>
		<desc>Shellshock takes you back to the years of the Vietnam war. You take on the role of a rookie soldier on his first tour of duty. Using a third-person perspective, you experience napalm bombardments of civilian villages, sneaky night missions along the river banks, claustrophobic tunnel systems and huge battles in temples and open fields. Most missions are played as a team, but your team members cannot die and do not influence the mission objectives. You will have to assassinate enemy generals, take out crucial boats and guide your team through unknown territory.

The game does not have drivable vehicles, multiplayer options or extensive environmental interaction, but it features a particular system of dismantling the many bombs and traps: in a race against time, you have to perform a long key sequence in the correct order to clear the path. The atrocities on both sides are clearly shown in the cutscenes, filmed as through a shaky hand-camera. Either side is not afraid to abuse civilians for their cause and this sense of realism gives the game a rather raw edge. You can even purchase the services of hookers in the base camp.</desc>

It was published by Atlus in Japan and North America in 2006, and in Europe the following year.

The game differs from the two previous Devil Summoner titles in having real-time battles and a named protagonist and is first in the entire franchise to be set in the past – specifically the year 1931, the fictional twentieth year of the Taishō period of Japan, wherein it deals with historical figures such as Grigori Rasputin in addition to the Shin Megami Tensei series' traditional use of real-world mythological figures.

It contains a second disc with a special version of Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne Maniax (itself an enhanced version of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne), entitled Chronicle Edition, not available outside of this compilation. 

This version differs from the standard one by replacing Dante, the featured main character from Devil May Cry series, with Raidou Kuzunoha, the protagonist of the titular game, as well as his cat Gotou. Raidou is confronted as a boss enemy early in the game, replacing Dante. Following a brief dialogue with Gotou, the player-controlled party fights Raidou, whose attacks are similar to those displayed by Dante in the earlier version.

		<desc>Junkyard, a town of endless rain. With his four companions, Serf, the main character and a member of a tribe called Embryon, sets out for Nirvana, a land that can only be reached by the champions of Junkyard. They devote themselves to fighting against the never-ending resistance mustered by other tribes. In the midst of chaos, a mysterious object, the Pod, suddenly appears. Countless spheres of light are emitted by the Pod and infect Serf and his comrades, awakening their demonic powers. An unimaginable battle unfolds within their faint conscience. They develop a desire to tear the flesh and shatter the bones of their enemies, who have also been transformed. Their instincts tell them to devour every being in their path. Until then, Serf and his comrades only knew of battle, but for the first time, they experience new emotions. At that time, a dark-haired girl, Sera, comes to their rescue. Although she does not know where she came from, she holds a strange power - the power to control the party's demonic transformation. They receive orders from the Church of Karma to head for Nirvana, and they are accompanied by the dark-haired girl. "They who reach Nirvana first shall be recognized as the champions of Junkyard." The struggle intensifies, and they discover that the girl holds a key to the mystery. But, true fear still awaits Serf's party. Including Embryon, the tribe that the main character leads, several groups are at war with each other in order to survive. "Devour" your enemies and absorb their devastating powers and special abilities!</desc>

		<desc>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne[a] is a role-playing video game developed by Atlus for the PlayStation 2. It was published by Atlus in Japan and North America, and by Ghostlight in Europe. It is the third numbered entry in the Shin Megami Tensei series, the central series in the Megami Tensei franchise. 

Nocturne follows a high school student in post-apocalyptic Tokyo, who is transformed into the demonic Demi-fiend after the world undergoes Conception, an apocalyptic event triggered by a sinister cult to enable the world's rebirth in a new form. With Tokyo transformed into a Vortex World filled with demons, the Demi-fiend becomes instrumental to the schemes of the Reasons, beings who seek to remake the world in their image, and Lucifer, the lord of demons. The gameplay uses a turn-based battle system based on exploiting weaknesses, and a Demon recruitment system allowing the player to recruit demons found in the Vortex World to fight alongside them.</desc>

		<name>Shining Tears</name>
		<desc>Shining Tears is an old-school Action RPG set in the Shining universe (previous games include Shining in the Darkness and the Shining Force Trilogy). You play Xion, a hero who is drawn into saving the City of Shilidia from a formerly peaceful neighbor due to his possession of the powerful Twin Dragon Rings. This sets the stage for an epic RPG storyline with fun characters and big surprises.

Presented in beautiful hand-drawn 2D graphics and backgrounds, players may choose to go into battles from among 8 unlockable companions, each with their own unique powers, strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the co-op system lets two players cooperate in battles, pulling off special combo moves and leveling up their characters together. Interestingly, the companion you pick changes Xion to the opposite 'soul' dark or light due to the nature of the Twin Dragon Rings, with correspondingly different powers. Single players have their companion AI to help them out of tight spots, too.</desc>

Shrek's in-laws aren't too thrilled that a crude ogre is married to their beloved daughter, Fiona, so the battle for acceptance ensues. The game also covers things not shown in the film. Plot elements are delivered primarily through a storybook interface (text and illustrations) shown before each level. The player is able to play as Shrek or his friends throughout the game, and travel through 11 levels, while being able to switch between the four characters available in each level. In each level, the player controls a team of four characters, and can switch between them at any point. Each character has a unique ability that aids them in fighting enemies or moving through the environment (for example, Donkey can destroy obstacles and Fiona can slow down time).</desc>

		<desc>Billed as a re-imagining of the original Silent Hill, Shattered Memories once again casts you as Harry Mason searching across the haunted town for his missing daughter Cheryl. New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill's demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game - when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life.

Between scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist's office, who asks you personal questions about yourself and your past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on your responses, changing characters and lines of dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable.

As you search for Cheryl, you will come across objects and recordings that tell some of the history of Silent Hill.</desc>

The only chance for mankind's survival is a top-secret starship class known as Silpheed and the hyper-skilled pilots at the controls. And so begins the premise of Silpheed: The Lost Planet, a co-development shooting project between Game Arts and Treasure that remakes the early '90s PC shooter of the same name. Features include a large variety of enemy types, multiple weapon upgrades, and polygonal graphics. As an added bonus, Working Designs has removed the slowdown and added analog control for the American version of the game.</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons : Hit &amp; Run</name>
		<desc>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run can be best described as Grand Theft Auto in Springfield.

The player takes on the role of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa or Apu and try to uncover a mystery surrounding mechanical bees that are taking over Springfield, mysterious vans, and cola that can control the minds of those who drink it.

Like GTA, the game follows a linear-based path through fifty plus missions. The player will have to chase cars and find out where they're headed, grab all the spilling cola cans before people can drink them, and chasing down villains before they get away.

Throughout the course of the game, the player can unlock tons of rewards by completing missions in a set amount of time or performing outstanding stunts.

All voiceovers are performed by those who act in the show, including Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Julie Kavner (Marge) and Yeardley Smith (Lisa).

The game supports multiplayer action for up to four players.</desc>

After the crew's creation, a slide-show starts of some mobile phone pictures that are taken showing the trip and also showing the storm that wrecks the ship. The player's starting Sim wakes up on First Beach on Shipwreck Island. The Sim finds books detailing the goals the Sim must follow to survive on the islands and escape. Shortly after exploring Shipwreck Island, the Sim discovers a second island, Airplane Island, this one considerably larger and more interesting than the first, and builds a raft to reach the new location. After arriving on the island, the Sim is reunited with some of their lost crew. The player then has the option to form a tribe of Sims if the relationship is strong enough. While exploring Airplane Island, the player finds radio parts that are required to complete a goal later in the game. A third island, Volcano Island, can be reached once the player finds the second beach on Airplane Island and builds a canoe. On Volcano Island, the player will discover the remains of the llama people. The player has the option to return to civilization on this island. They can either build a boat or travel to the volcano's summit and use the radio parts to send an SOS signal to a nearby ship. The player can also repair a broken ceremonial forge on Volcano Island that will cause a fourth island, Crystal Island, to rise out of the sea, however this is optional and is not required for the player to escape the island. The game contains many discoverable secrets, including secret areas such as Hidden Lagoon and the Secret Pirate's Cove. These areas can only be accessed once the player has gathered objects such as hieroglyphics and treasure map pieces, however this is a relatively extensive process.</desc>

		<desc>The story of Forbidden Siren (European title), released as Siren in Japan in 2003, centers on a land-locked village in Japan that disappears following the loud blaring of a siren. Later that day, the once inhabitants of the village emerge from blood-red waters that now surround the remnants of the village. They're no longer human though, having been somehow transformed into zombies. Choose from multiple characters, including a teenage boy leading a blind girl and a teacher and student duo to make your escape from the nightmare town. Forbidden Siren incorporates haunting environments, eerily realistic characters complete with motion-captured facial expressions, and unsettling camera techniques, resulting in one of the most terrifying games to date.</desc>

		<name>Sky Gunner</name>
		<desc>SkyGunner is a third person flight combat game, with its emphasis on action. Players choose to take the role of either Ciel, Femme, or Copain, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill. Players can turn the plane's direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, and use afterburners. Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types: "Look Targeting" and "Weapon Lock". Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy at the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to shoot them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group.

The primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, that includes Firework Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission events.</desc>

		<desc>Arcade-style mission-based combat-free flight simulator.

Features 10 different aircraft (7 of which must be unlocked), ranging from the Swordfish Mk. 1 biplane to jets to UFO's. All craft can be customized with parts earned by completing missions.

Includes 5 different game modes: Adventure Mode, in which you fly a series of missions searching for the map pieces needed to find the legendery Tower of Maximus; Target Mode, in which you must navigate through a series of targets; Sky Canvas Mode, in which you paint patterns in the sky; Training Mode, a basic tutorial; and Free Flight Mode, in which you can fly freely around any of the maps you've seen in the adventure mode.

Missions in the adventure mode include such daring stunts as landing on moving trains, landing on an aircraft carrier in the middle of a storm, mid-air refuelling, and flying through caves, canyons, and forests. Weather effects are well-modelled, and you'll be buffetted around by strong winds and pushed down by strong rain and snow.</desc>

		<desc>Thief and raccoon Sly Cooper returns in a new cel-shaded platforming adventure wherein he forms a band of thieves with Bentley the turtle and Murray the purple, hippo-like creature, which each have their own role within the game.

Sly is the fastest, most agile member of the band of thieves and still is the character you play with the most. But certain missions require the special abilities of Bentley, who is smart and can drop bombs, as well shoot enemies from a distance. Other missions require the muscles of Murray, who can lift nearly everything, including enemies.

The main goal of the game is the retrieval of a number of clockwork pieces from different locations around the world. Each theft has to be prepared with a number of sub-missions which have to be completed before the 'real thing' can begin.</desc>

		<desc>Sly and the gang is back in this third outing of Sly Raccoon-series. This time, the story takes the boys (Sly, Bentley and Murray) to the fortress that houses the treasures of Sly's family. Although they are still weary from the adventures in the previous game, they have to get up and face the new threat that could mean the end of Sly's business and the loss of his family heritage. The game itself is a lot like the previous games: Sly sneaks, jumps, and swings himself around the levels, collecting various items, defeating bad guys and ultimately taking on the boss character. The other members of the gang step in on the action once in a while but the Sly centric sections are the main focus of the game. If you like games that had many things to do, this sneak-em-up/platform/action/adventure/puzzle game is for you.</desc>

You must collect all the keys in the world to fight the world's boss.

Many of the levels have a platformer structure. The objective of these worlds is to reach the location of the key. There are substantial stealth elements here as you must dodge searchlights and trips lasers which set off alarms and avoid alerting guards. In addition to the main objective, there are clue bottles to find. Finding all the clues in a level allows you to open a safe with a page from the Thievius Raccoonus which grants a new ability of some sort.

If you can survive the high speed chases, the off-road evasion, the gunfire and the dust... you stand to make quite a profit. Maybe enough to outfit your vehicle for your next smuggling endeavor. Something that will make the next run a little less hazardous.</desc>

		<name>Sniper Elite</name>
		<desc>Sniper Elite is a third-person action strategy game with a focus on sniping. The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are.

The single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target. It can be played with a friend in local 2-player co-op. Players can revive each other.</desc>

In the single player missions, commands can be spoken using the included USB headset or via an onscreen menu if the optional SOCOM headset was not purchased. Typical missions consist of killing terrorists, rescuing hostages, retrieving intelligence, or destroying terrorist bases.

The player character's codename is Kahuna, while the NPC teammates' codenames are Boomer, Spectre and Jester. The team is divided into two sub-groups, Alpha and Bravo. The Alpha group consists of the player and Boomer, while the remaining two make up Bravo. Commands can be issued to both individuals and a whole group, for example it is possible to ask team Bravo to remain stationary while the player is scouting the area with Boomer. However the player can not venture alone through a map, when Kahuna is too far away from Boomer he will automatically resume following the player, regardless of prior orders. Briefings and intel such as maps and photos are given prior to each mission.</desc>

Combined Assault's campaign mode offers 18 missions. The game takes place solely in the fictional country of Adjekistan. The country is supposedly situated somewhere in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region of Central Asia, featuring a number of different environment and climate zonesâ€”allowing for the game to feature a wide variety of landscapes and settings while working within one large, connected story. The online servers were shut down on August 31, 2012[1] Although the Combined Assault servers were shut down, some gamers still play via LAN using programs like Xlink Kai.[citation needed]</desc>

A sequel to Sonic Riders, entitled Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity, was released in 2008 for the Wii and PlayStation 2, followed by the Kinect-required game Sonic Free Riders for the Xbox 360 in 2010. This was the last Sonic the Hedgehog game for the GameCube and Microsoft Xbox.</desc>

		<desc>Soul Nomad &amp; the World Eaters begins in a world called Prodesta where an evil entity named Gig has returned with his three beasts known as World Eaters. The land of Prodesta has battled these monsters before, two hundred years earlier when Princess Layna sacrificed herself to capture the enemies and save the land from certain doom. Now they are back and you are the chosen hero who must battle through several environments to keep Prodesta alive. After creating your character, you learn that Gig has possessed your body and is offering you his strength to defeat your foes. Unfortunately, the powers you accept from Gig allow him to overtake more of your mind. A large part of the game is learning how much power you can use before you are completely consumed by evil. You are sent through the world to battle Gig's minions on grid-based battlefields with a party of your creation. Your group is composed of soldiers you purchase with Gig points, and you must set them up on the battleground so that their attributes and skills are put to good use. However, if you are running low on points you can also kidnap townsfolk and force them to join your cause. Battle is based around team work, and there are 40 different group abilities you may add to your arsenal as you attempt to defeat the enemy and save Prodesta.</desc>

		<desc>An action game spin-off in the Total Warrior series. Play as a mighty Spartan trooper, and battle through hordes of enemies in large environments, while working with allies. Use ultra-violent special attacks to mow down entire groups of foes at once, with ridiculously bloody effect.

The game has a fast-paced, arcade-like, mission-based gameplay. In each mission, you must succeed in minor goals like killing the generals of the opposition, escorting sappers to blow up enemy siege weaponry and preventing the enemy from making to behind your borders. The storyline progresses through cutscenes, shown in-between each mission.

Depending on how you succeed in your mission, you get "tokens", which you can use to upgrade the health, damage or power of your character. The player is capable of doing special moves, which can be learned throughout the game. Some of the special moves gain their powers through the spartan gods, that aid the player in his battle. During the game, you can find different weapons like swords, bows and spears, and of course, shields.</desc>

More than 15 characters from the film are represented as playable drivers in the game and the vehicles from the film can be selected from the game's menu. Maximum speeds during the races can exceed 350 MPH.

The race tracks feature loops, jumps, corkscrews, and many twists and turns. They all have a high-tech look with bright colors. The game offers split-screen multiplayer in addition to single player races. Drivers can engage in combat during races by employing "car-fu" manoeuvres such as "tail toss", "boost bash", "smack down", "round house", and "torpedo", among others.</desc>

		<desc>Spider-Man is a level based action game, with the player as Spider-Man. Half the levels are indoors, but the rest of the levels are outside among the sky-scrapers of New York and require him to web-sling from building to building, however Spider Man cannot land on the ground, as he will die if he gets too close. Levels are in "sections" with a different enemy for each, each section lasting about 3 levels. Each level, except for the last two, has a bonus screen after it. Generally, there are the bonuses "Time" (clear level in a set time), "Perfect" (Not take damage/detected) and "Style" (use as many combos as possible). Other level-specific ones are "Secrets" (Uncover a secret area), "Combat" (Defeat all enemies). Players can gain, depending on difficulty, points on completing these tasks.</desc>

		<name>Spider-Man : Friend or Foe</name>
		<desc>Spider-Man finds himself beset by his movie villains. He gains help from New Goblin as he combats the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, and Venom. All six characters suddenly find themselves targeted by an enemy force and one-by-one, the villains begin disappearing. Meanwhile, Spider-Man is rescued by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D., who informs him that the meteor which brought the Venom symbiote to Earth had broken up in the Earth's atmosphere and five more pieces had landed in numerous locations across the globe. Fury sends Spider-Man to retrieve the shards of meteors. Spider-Man quickly finds that the villains who attacked him and several more of his foes, including Rhino and Scorpion, have been placed under mind control of a mysterious villain. The villain also creates and controls holographic/symbiote combination foot soldiers called P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s (short for Perpetual Holographic Avatar Nano-Tech Offensive Monsters). As Spider-Man fights his enemies one-by-one and rescues them from the mind control, they promise to aid him in finding the villain responsible. As Spider-Man progresses, he obtains more allies such as Black Cat, Iron Fist, Lizard (not portrayed as a villain), and Blade. He discovers that the evil genius is Mysterio, who intends to use his army to take over the world, using each shard of the meteor to make them stronger. Spider-Man decides to temporarily don the Black Suit for the final battle.</desc>

		<desc>It is two years following the events of the first game. Spider-Man is trying to balance his civilian and superhero life, frequently late or absent for school, work, and leisure time with his friends. Following dinner with Mary Jane Watson, Peter thwarts an armed looting of an art museum, and tracks down an escaped robber, the Black Cat. Soon after this, he thwarts an attack in the streets of Manhattan by The Rhino. Meanwhile, Doctor Otto Octavius attempts to recreate nuclear fusion of that seen in the sun to provide an energy source for Manhattan. To control this fusion, he creates four metal arms which he can mentally control. His fusion creates a strong magnetic field, destroying the lab, killing his wife Rosie, and grafting his metal arms to his spine and giving his arms control over him. He blames Spider-Man for the incident, despite the fact that Spider-Man was not in the lab until the middle of it.</desc>

Each mission, of which there are fourteen (including 2 training levels), has one primary objective and a number of secondary objectives. There is a range of objectives, though the gameplay is similar on every level: the player must drive along shooting enemy vehicles, avoiding civilians and destroying set targets. Every mission must be completed within a time limit. Objectives are generally to destroy things like enemy weapons, equipment and communications towers, to avoid civilian casualties, to tag things with tracking devices and so on, although some objectives that are a little different include escaping from a warehouse using a trabant within a tight time limit, escorting and protecting allied vehicles and even chasing and destroying a stolen Interceptor vehicle.</desc>

Produced under the EA SPORTS BIG brand, the SSX 3 development team at EA Canada is adding technologies that bring to life rich natural graphics such as snow that sparkles and blows in the wind and realistic character shadowing. A new gameplay experience allows users to seamlessly ride from one awesome area to the next- entering competitions, taking on Big Challenges and discovering hidden collectibles. SSX 3 has blown out the trick component with unlimited combos and new, over-the-top tricks.

In addition to the new boarding venues, Big Challenges rewards players for completing any of the more than 100 unique challenges as they explore the mountain's vast world. Grind billboards, board press logs, even hand plant the fence line.

The musical soundtrack features a broad range of music from artists including the X-Ecutioners, Felix Da Housecat, Queens of the Stone Age, N.E.R.D., and many more.</desc>

Skirmish Mode - Players can instantly enter single or multiplayer battles without a mission. Ships and abilities unlocked in Episode Mode can be used here.

Episode Mode - Players go through missions from the five shows (starting with Enterprise and finishing with Voyager), collecting new ships, and character cards of each generation's command crew, which upgrades their respective ship's capabilities.

Mulitiplayer Mode - Players go head to head in combat campaigns to see who can survive the longest in battle.

The full arsenal of Trek weapons and abilities can be used for each ship, including phasers, photon/quantum torpedoes, shields, scanners, mines, tractor beams, and transporters.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars : Battlefront</name>
		<desc>Star Wars: Battlefront encompasses battles between four main factions from both the original and prequel trilogies: the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) of the prequel era, and the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire of the classic trilogy. However, factions can only play their historical adversary; there cannot be any Rebels vs. Separatists or Clones vs. Empire fights. In each faction, five different classes of characters become available. Four of the classes are similar for each faction: a basic infantry soldier (a Super battle droid for the CIS), heavy weapons soldier, pilot and sniper. Also featured are special characters for each group including: Droidekas (CIS), Jet Troopers (Republic), Dark Troopers (Imperials), and Wookie Smugglers (Rebels).

Two players can play splitscreen co-op throughout the story campaign or a strategic Galactic Conquest campaign.There is also a "comp stomp" configuration that supports 2 players offline, 2 players splitscreen online, or up to 16 players online.Drop-in/drop-out is only supported in online matches.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi in the single player mode, reliving various scenes from the film through the game's missions. There are 17 levels, interlaced with over 12 minutes of footage from the movie. Enemies include droids, clone soldiers and Neimodian forces. The game's combat system is heavily concentrated on lightsaber combat. Each of the playable characters (with the exception of the IG-100 Magnaguard) is equipped with at least one lightsaber. There are three basic attacks: Fast attacks which do the least amount of damage, Strong Attacks which do more damage but are slower to execute, and the slowest but strongest Critical Attacks. These attacks can be mixed to create combination attacks. Attacks can also be charged up for greater strength. One feature of the game is called a Saber Lock - a sequence in which the player's character clashes swords with an opponent. Other offensive maneuvers are also available, including grapples, jumps and flying kicks.</desc>

		<name>Starsky &amp; Hutch</name>
		<desc>Starsky &amp; Hutch is an arcade racing game based on the popular TV series from the 70s, released to tie in with the film. The game includes 18 missions, each based on an episode of the TV show and introduced by Antonio 'Huggy Bear' Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment looking for action and trouble.

Like the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky &amp; Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through.

The overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal's car. There is always a secondary target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers.</desc>

		<desc>Stella Deus is a tactical RPG of Japanese origin. It follows the party-based conventions of genre landmarks such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre Battle, or Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth, but features realistically rendered characters and rich, 3D environments. The game's sophisticated, philosophy-infused storyline involves an evil mist, appropriately known as the "Miasma," which has gradually covered the fantasy-style game world, bringing death and despair. Players lead a team of adventures who seek to cleanse the world of the cursed fog, though each for his or her own reason, and hoping to reach this shared goal by a different means.</desc>

The two games are very similar sharing the same physics engine and graphics, although Strike Force featured more locations as well as left-handed, and reverse-hook bowlers. LAB Rats assisted in the development of Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling so the game has the same physics engine, but has a more fantasy-oriented theme. Strike Force features 14 places to Bowl (12 in Fast Lanes) and 8 Playable characters. There are only 7 locations, but each has its own "nighttime" variant which is unlocked as a secret stage. It also features Golf Mode, Challenge Mode, Skins, and Tournaments. There are also 14 different bowling balls to use, such as the Lightning, and level specific ones like the Bone Crasher and Pharaoh's Magic.</desc>

		<name>Suikoden IV</name>
		<desc>An orphan boy was brought up in a noble household on the island of Razril, part of a federation known as the Island Nations, which is threatened by their powerful neighbor, the Kooluk Empire. When the boy grows up, he trains together with other young people, hoping to become a knight in the Gaien order. One day, during an escort mission, the knights' ship is attacked by pirates. Through a series of events, the hero is branded with the Rune of Punishment, one of the twenty-seven legendary True Runes. While devastating the enemies, this rune is also bound to deplete its bearer's life. Blamed for the death of his commander, who was unable to withstand the power of the rune, the young knight is exiled from his homeland. He must find a way to use his powers for the good of the Island Nations, fight against a Kooluk invasion, and restore his honor in the process.

Suikoden IV is a prequel to the entire series. The events of the game take place a hundred and fifty years before those of the first game, and the region of the Suikoden universe they occur in are the islands south of Toran. The game retains many classic features of the series: the ability to recruit 108 characters (Stars of Destiny);  building and customization of army headquarters (this time a large ship instead of a castle); emphasis on political issues in the story; the ability to equip runes of various kinds in combat that allow the usage of magic spells, etc. 

The amount of active combatants in the party has been reduced from six to four in this installment. Once again, there are three types of combat in the game: the most frequent turn-based party-vs.-party combat, duels, and tactical battles, which now take place on sea. The player can customize the the naval forces by choosing captains and commanding officers, and assigning to them runic elements. Each element has strengths and weaknesses to another one, and the player must use them tactically to gain the upper hand. Ship placement on the battle grid and attack angles play a role as well.

New to the series is ship navigation - instead of exploring an overworld on foot, the player navigates a ship, discovering new lands and islands. Also for the first time in the series there is voice acting, a fully rotatable camera, and the possibility to navigate the main character from first-person perspective.</desc>

		<desc>The game takes place 20 years after the previous. Halassar, a province in the Empire of Galdyr, distant from the kingdoms of Medeva and Orenia, was foretold as the birthplace of the Goddess Laharah Reborn. The priestesses of Laharah declared Maia as the goddess when she was an infant and armies rose up in Maia's name, led by the Emperor's brother Prince Taurgis, making Halassar independent from Galdyr and Maia, the Queen of the Halassar Empire. Traveling with her is Sangaril, an orphan trained by the Shadow Clan assassins of the Munari, who was sent to kill Maia as a child, but instead became her sworn bodyguard. While reclaiming the Book of Prophets from the Halassar Palace traitor Dama Sivora, Maia activates a rune stone embedded in the pirate island stronghold of Prince Neru, on the Isle of Teomura, gaining the ability to transform into one of the 4 Summons. After recovering the Book of the Prophets and returning to the Palace she learns more about her destiny.</desc>

All of the levels from those two games are available in this collection, and all of the minigames are already unlocked and included. Formerly only available to GameCube players, the Super Monkey Ball series has made it to the PS2 and Xbox after a wait of almost 3 and a half years. The game itself plays very much like the old arcade game Marble Madness. You control a monkey in a ball, and you have to navigate it through many perilous labyrinths to the finish. In the previous two games you had limited lives/tries, but here you have infinite lives, which makes it all the easier.</desc>

Meanwhile, Stone discovers that Cosa Nostra want to retrieve the virus to use it as a tool in mafia wars. So Stone went on a mission to Pescara to assassinate the mafia head, Dimitri Alexoupolos. Dimitri's assassination prevented a Mafia family from gaining access to Syphon Filter.</desc>

		<name>Taiko Drum Master</name>
		<desc>Taiko Drum Master is an entry in Namco's Taiko No Tatsujin rhythm game series and the first to have a Western release. As in other rhythm games, the goal is to interact with a special controller according to scrolling onscreen prompts timed to music. This game comes bundled with the TaTaCon drum controller, a miniature version of a Japanese taiko drum with sensors in the middle and on the sides.

In-game actions are indicated by scrolling circle icons. Red circles indicate hitting the center of the drum, while blue circles require the player to hit the edge. On big circles, the player can hit both center or edge sensors for bonus points. Finally, yellow lines and balloons require the player to perform drum rolls.

The game comes with a varied set of tunes: from covered pop hits like Material Girl and ABC to music from other Namco games such as Katamari Damacy and Dragon Spirit and even television theme songs. In addition, there are also several mini-games included on the disc that use the TaTaCon for more esoteric purposes, such as watermelon eating and wolf-stacking.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</name>
		<desc>Based on the newer anime styled FOX cartoon of the same name, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles features Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello as green ninjas. Living in the sewers, they creep out when nobody is looking to fight for truth, justice and another slice of pizza. Fighting against the public face of inventor Baxter Stockman and the more shadowy figure of Shredder and his Foot Clan, these Ninja Turtles will get the chance to make their opponents eat shell!

The game is a 3D beat-em-up with multiple players. The game sprites all resemble the cartoony look of the TV show and each turtle features unique moves, sound bytes and fighting style all his own. Ninja Turtle moves include a weaker/quicker attack, a stronger/slower attack, Ninja Shuriken and a Jump-Kick. There is a story mode for one or two players, and there is also a versus mode where two players can fight head to head. In the versus mode, players can fight as all 4 turtles, Splinter, Casey Jones, Hamato Yoshi, The Turtlebot, Hun, Oroku Saki, and Shredder. A Challenge mode is unlockable by defeating Oroku Saki with any Turtle in the Story Mode, which needs to be complete to unlock Hamato Yoshi and his dojo.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 : Mutant Nightmare</name>
		<desc>TMNT3 puts more of a focus on teamwork, character development and control than any other console Turtles game to date. Gamers can play as their favorite Turtle alone or with up to three friends, earning experience points along the way as they slash and bash Foot Ninjas and powerful, well-known bosses from the TMNT universe. These experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4 players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled through AI. All the Turtles can participate in Cooperative Attack to beat enemies and players can give commands to the AI.</desc>

		<desc>Loved across the world for its amazing characters, explosive graphics and lightning-fast gameplay, Tekken 5 promises to deliver the next generation of blistered fingers and bleary eyes as it brings players the ultimate, most visually stunning fighting experience ever seen in a Tekken game.
Tekken 5 brings back the popular cast of characters from the previous games along with three new characters for a total of 20 default characters to start, with even more to unlock as you progress in the game. The game allows players to use fight money to customize their character with various accessories such as hats, glasses and an assortment of different costumes. Each of the new characters is equipped with a variety of deadly techniques, and the returning characters have been updated with new moves and combos. New to Tekken 5 is a bonus action adventure game that unfolds a side story to the action-packed fighting sequences.
After the completion of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, a fierce battle between father and son unfolded at Mishima Zaibatsu headquarters. Jin emerges as the victor in this battle and continues to defeat Heihachi, his grandfather - but spares both Kazuya and Heihachi's lives in honour of his mother who loved peace. Soon after Jin's departure, a swarm of Jacks arrive at Honmaru and begin to attack Heihachi and Kazuya - and in order to escape, Kazuya thrusts Heihachi into the swarm of Jacks. A great explosion destroys Honmaru, and a man watching from afar reports, "Heihachi Mishima is dead." While many presume the death of Heihachi Mishima will end the reign of Mishima Zaibatsu, an announcement is made for the fifth King of Iron Fist Tournament, with an unknown replacement to Heihachi leading the organization. The fight begins once again.</desc>

The cutting-edge gameplay that is promised in the extended intros of fighting games is finally realised in Tekken Tag Tournament This visually stunning action game contains fully rendered 3-D characters who can execute smoothly animated martial-arts moves. With polygonal characters and texture maps this real, you will end up looking for the coin slot on your PS2.

With more than 30 characters to fight against or beside, this game allows you to pull off the ultimate human combo: tag-team fighting. By choosing two fighters who have broadly divergent skills, you can increase your threat to the other fighters greatly. Also, switching out fighters can give an overextended partner enough time to rest up his or her stamina for the next tag. See what happens when one partner throws a foe, tags, and the other partner comes in to keep the foe... uh... airborne. Tekken Tag Tournament contains 20 classic characters from other parts of the acclaimed Tekken series, as well as 12 new characters who can be unlocked during gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts' Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise. Although the game's features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved GameFace character creation.

Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on The Matrix films to generate digital doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands.

PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game. The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.</desc>

		<name>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08</name>
		<desc>The 2008 edition in the Tiger Woods PGA series introduces enhancements and improvements to the previous version without major graphical or gameplay changes. There are new courses (Xbox 360/PS3: 5 new, 16 in total - PS2: 6 new, 18 in total) and different licensed professional golf players to choose from (21 on the Xbox 360/PS3 - 23 on the PS2/Wii).

The Xbox 360, PS2, PS3 and Windows versions allow players to import photos to create in-game faces on the characters based on custom images, using the Xbox Live Vision camera, PlayStation EyeToy, PlayStation Eye or a webcam. Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.

The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.

The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).

On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.</desc>

With successful tournaments and accomplishments the player receives experience and skill points which are used to improve the character's abilities. The player can choose between two click and the True Swing controls: in the former the player needs to click two respectively three times in the right timing to set the hit conditions and in the latter the player simulates the hit movement with the analog stick. There are overall 27 licensed players and 20 courses.</desc>

6 courses, with a choice of 12 golfers (including Tiger, Justin Leonard and many more) are available, plus a host of fictional characters each with a different style of play and attitude towards golf.

Game modes include the usual single player campaign to take the golfing crown, the Tiger Challenge (where you play against or with Tiger Woods on the Tiger Dream 18 holes) and Speed Golf, where the technical aspects of golf are thrown out the window. It's just you against a friend to see who can get to the hole quickest.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2401 the space marine Sergeant Cortez is leaving the space station that he visited in the end of his previous journey. He soon discovers that the crystals he has found can power up a time machine. After having located traces of TimeSplitter activities in various time periods on the Earth, Cortez boards the time machine and travels to these periods, hoping to aid various characters in their battles against evil.

TimeSplitters: Future Perfect is a first-person shooter in which players battle their way through thirteen story missions spread across six time periods, either alone or cooperatively. The protagonist's arsenal varies depending on the time period he travels to: for example, traveling to 1924 will allow Cortez to wield World War I weapons; a Soviet setting in the 1960's contains various local firearms of that time period; stages that take place in the future feature corresponding futuristic weaponry, etc. In addition to fast-paced shooting gameplay there are also some stealth and vehicle-driving segments.

Like in the previous installments of the series, various multiplayer modes are included. Players can take on computer-controlled opponents on any of the fifteen arcade maps, or make their own ones. Players can also compete for awards in dozens of arcade league matches and challenges. It is possible to choose from between 150 characters and challenge other players to a head-to-head battle, either with up to four-player split screen or online and LAN play.</desc>

Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York.  A mysterious figure calling himself the "Nightwatcher" has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan.  Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!

TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.  Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle.  Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights.  Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York.  Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff.</desc>

		<desc>Rainbow responds to a series of terrorist attacks against US interests in South America, apparently being conducted by Islamic terrorists sponsored by Saudi Arabia. However, the true mastermind behind the attacks is actually the newly elected President of Venezuela, Juan Crespo. Crespo managed to get elected by advocating a strong anti-terror platform and exploiting the fear caused by the terrorist attacks (which he himself orchestrated). Crespo's plan is to discredit Saudi Arabia, then cut off the Venezuelan supply of oil to the United States, creating an oil crisis and driving up the price of oil, which he would then sell to the US on the black market at highly inflated prices.

Rainbow manages to foil Crespo's plans, and ultimately assassinates President Crespo himself. Rainbow then arranges for the international media to credit the terrorists with causing Crespo's death.</desc>

		<desc>American Wasteland is the first game in the Tony Hawk's franchise that advertised and allowed the possibility for players to play in one vast level via story mode, which actually seamlessly connects a number of levels without loading times in between, along with also being the first game in the series that allows to freely commandeer stray bicycles and perform freestyle BMX techniques similar to skateboarding. A new maneuver, the Bert Slide, was added to skateboarding controls. In the September 2005 edition of Game Informer, a map was shown displaying American Wasteland's Los Angeles with an insert of an overhead view of the Boston stage from Underground 2 for comparison. The Boston level appeared to be about three quarters the size of one American Wasteland area, with the exception of the "Vans Skatepark" and "Casino" areas.</desc>

You can also collect hidden keys and wrenches that offer extra lives and hidden stages, nitro boosts to give an extra dose of speed, and clocks to give you a little more time to accomplish to task. And you can race against a friend in split screen mode to see who can race their little speedster the best.</desc>

		<name>Top Spin</name>
		<desc>Top Spin is the Xbox's first tennis game, and it's playable over Xbox Live, allowing the player to compete in the XSN Sports Network. Over Xbox Live, two players can face each other in a one-on-one match, while in a doubles game up to four players can join. Stats are recorded and rankings are updated hourly at XSNsports.com.

The game has a career mode that takes the player all over the world. The first step is to create a player and give him a technical mastery. Once in the game, the player may compete in various tournaments. There are games, minor pro games, and professional tournaments. Winning games earns money and a higher ranking. The goal is to go from rank one hundred to number one.

Four different statistics can be gradually improved: serve, backhand, forehand, and volley. A higher skill will make for better and harder serves, more accurate and powerful back- and forehands, and the ability to keep the ball in play longer with volleys. There are also skills to obtain, such as risk and ace, which improves chances of hitting a successful risk shot or acing the opponent on a serve.

In Exhibition mode, the player may choose a created character or one of several real life pros, such as Pete Sampras or Anna Kournikova.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Torino 2006 (USA).bin</path>
		<name>Torino 2006</name>
		<desc>Torino 2006 is the official game of the XX Winter Olympic Games held in Turin, Italy, and the eight in the line of multi-event IOC licensed titles. The game includes 15 events scattered on 8 disciplines: Alpine Skiing (Downhill, Super G, Giant Slalom and Slalom), Ski Jump (Normal and Large hill), Speed Skating (500m, 1000m and 1500m), Women's Biathlon, Nordic Combined, Bobsled (Womens' 2 and Mens' 4), Luge and Cross Country. All venues were modelled after their real counterparts.

Gameplay, as expected, requires more reflexes than the button-bashing of their Summer counterparts. Alpine Skiing is a matter of skill and quick reflexes, as the player, other than set the direction, only has to choose when to crouch to gain speed (mostly in Downhill and Giant Slalom) and when to carve the snow for sharper turns (either to correct a bad trajectory or approach a tighter gate). These events are based on a simplified version of the engine that power Ski Alpin 2006, also by 49Games. Unlike most other games that feature alpine skiing, the penalty for missing gate depends on the difficulty level chosen: on easy, six misses are allowed, three in medium and none on hard, each carrying a time penalty that depending on how well the player did can just affect the total score or mean losing a medal.

Ski Jump (also a simplified version of another game, RTL Skispringen 2006) requires the player to keep the balance while descending the hill, jumping at the correct time, counter the effect of the wind in the athletes' balance for maximum distance and then land in perfect telemark fashion.

Cross Country and Biathlon are relaxed disciplines where all that counts is keeping the best trajectory possible while looking out for straight paths that can be used for short sprints and downhill slopes that can be done while crouching, which allows greater speeds and lower fatigue accumulated from sprints and more hasty climbs. Biathlon is pretty much the same as Cross Country, except it also includes two shooting sessions, with the steadiness of the aim affected by the fatigue levels.

Skating disciplines require a strong, well timed start, and then accurate button pressing as the skater makes each step. Bobsled and Luge are similar with only two differences: The startup in Bobsled is done by following the on-screen cues and press up on the right time and other than setting the direction, it's also possible to make minimal path changes. The winner is the fastest competitor after two heats (instead of the official four).

Nordic Combined is a Large hill ski jump which sets the start time for each competitor in the Cross country section.

It's possible to compete in all 15 or just 9 events, or even create your own competition, with up to four competitors. At each competition the players aim for both medals and the score table, based on the results on each individual event. However, the challenge does not stop with winning medals. The player can unlock additional strips by completing challenges, such as hitting all 10 targets in Biathlon, having a perfect Bobsled start, winning a gold medal and beat each top record on every event or not missing a single step on Speed Skating. The difficulty level affects events differently: in Alpine skiing, it means CPU-controlled players are faster and fewer gate misses are allowed, in Ski jump wind can appear from any direction and in Speed skating, in addition to set the pace, the player also has to steer the athlete to keep her in the best path.</desc>

Hoping to make a name for himself after his mentor is shot down, Marcus goes after the top crime syndicates of the city.

Besides having to do this, Marcus is a street-level cop. He is responsible for anything from stopping street fights to stopping gang wars to defusing bombs! Not only this, he can frisk people on the street for contraband, can do trunk searches on cars, as well as issue tickets to speeders.

But if Marcus is gonna do all those things, hes gonna do it his way. Need some cash? Marcus isn't opposed to a bit of extortion from the local pharmacy. Need some a way to stabilize your career after that rampage last week? Plant some evidence on a guy and bring him in. No one will know. Pistols not cutting it for you? The gun stores sell police officers anything, from M4's to flamethrowers to RPGs.

With the city of New York at your fingertips, and nearly every building accessible to you, how will you rule? Will you be a shining beacon of morals, or a shady figure in the underworld of NY. The choice is up to you.</desc>

		<name>TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2 : Bush Rescue</name>
		<desc>TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2 is a 3D Platformer with an Australian theme. The player takes the role of TY, a Tasmanian tiger, armed with sharp teeth and boomerangs a-plenty. On TY's quest to defeat the evil Boss Cass and his army of cold-blooded Frilled Lizards, he must assist the colorful residents of Burramudgee Town and the Southern Rivers, who include a tree frog, a lyre bird, a platypus family, some kangaroos and more koalas than you can shake a didgeridoo at.

While most of the game is standard platform fare, there are some diversions. Notably, there are a number of cart racing tracks which can be played with a friend. Additionally, there are missions that will place the player in giant robots, each with a different speciality (one is good at battle, one can put out fires, one is a submarine, etc.).

There are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road following a traffic accident. And finally, to top it all off, the save/continue points are outhouses.</desc>

		<desc>The story revolves around the Planet Mischief, where there is a tradition that once someone turns 3-years old, he/she must travel to a planet and learn how to perform "Mischief" and cause panic on that planet. Cosmi, a three-year old alien, travels to Earth for his mission, in order to impress his father, the Master of Mischief, Cosmi Sr., mostly because Earth is considered the greatest challenge. Cosmi crashes with a TV satellite from a town called Coco Town. When crash landing, he manages to hide in an alley on Coco Town, where he is saved by Earth's Mischief Master, Master Itazura. He takes him to his Dojo to train, and lets Cosmi move on with his mission, on 8 different locations: CocoTown, HighStakesHill, Pranksyvania, PharaohIsland, BigBootyBay, FrontiersVille, RaccoonCity and finally Cosmopolis. It is revealed that Cosmopolis is a trap for "Anti-Alien-Forces" to capture all of the aliens on Earth by disguising themselves as aliens. Itazura uses their trap as the final challenge for Cosmi, and challenges him personally there. Cosmi wins and travels back to Planet Mischief to celebrate, but crashes into another TV-station and crashlands on Earth again, this time, in the middle of CocoTown square. Of course, panic arises and reporters try to get a snapshot of the little alien, but Cosmi accidentally pushes someones camera around, causing it to take a photo of the crowd, thus revealing that several of them are also aliens.</desc>

		<name>Unlimited Saga</name>
		<desc>"Unlimited SaGa" is a sequel to Square's famous series of non-linear RPGs. Like in the early Romancing Saga games, and in Saga Frontier, you assume the role of eight main characters (selectable at the beginning of the game). The story centers around Laura, a 30-year old widow and an ex-pirate, but you view the story and make it progress differently depending on which character you have chosen, and on the decisions you take throughout the game. Each character is represented by a different kind of flower.

"Unlimited SaGa" feels and plays a lot like a classic board RPG. Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved by using a character's special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and reach the next area of the game.</desc>

Terrorists and gang members have destroyed your city, and your goal is to bring order back to the city while destroying any terrorists and gang members you encounter. Since your enemies are armed to the teeth (usually with meat cleavers, Molotov cocktails, and sawed-off shotguns), you're equipped with a riot shield that can be used by holding the left trigger. It can absorb an infinite amount of projectiles, but you cannot shoot while you are using it. You can get the assistance of firefighters to put out fires, and medics to replenish your health.

Your weapons can be upgraded by earning medals during your missions. You can earn these medals by scoring headshots, arresting enemies with your taser (as opposed to killing them), collecting gang masks, etc. You can even unlock extra missions and weapons by arresting gang leaders at the end of each level, so that the police can interrogate him and find out the gang's next move.</desc>

		<name>Valkyrie Profile 2 : Silmeria</name>
		<desc>Hundreds of years before Lenneth's tale, another saga lies concealed by the gods. The valkyrie Silmeria once served Odin loyally, but after an incident ignited a conflict between them, Odin forcefully reincarnated her as a human. The human soul that would carry her spirit was that of Alicia, Princess of Dipan. Ordinarily, Silmeria-s consciousness would have been sealed, her spirit dormant until she was next summoned... However, the forced transmigration causes Silmeria's spirit to awaken within Alicia, leaving two souls to inhabit a single body. The spirit that should have been sealed has awakened-a situation Odin will not ignore for long. This installment introduces the new Photon Action System to the classic side-scrolling action format found in the original. Projecting photons grants players more freedom to explore and expands the action, resulting in challenging puzzles with clever solutions. Add to that "sealstones" that affect the laws of nature in dungeons, launching strategy to new heights. The unique battle system of the previous game has evolved into the Advanced Tactical Combination Battle System.</desc>

		<name>Vampire Night</name>
		<desc>Vampire Night is a light gun game produced by Sega's Wow Entertainment, distributed through Namco and released in 2000 for video game arcades. It was later ported to PlayStation 2 in November 2001. Two players can team up to take down on screen enemies.

A struggle between light and dark, from 300 years back, is about to ensue. The parties involved are Michel and Albert, the two vampire hunters representing light, and the vampires representing dark. The story takes place in an alternate version of the year 2006 in France, when progress looks stuck in the late 19th century.

Michel and Albert rescue a 12-year-old girl named Caroline who witnessed a couple of villagers held hostage by the vampire sarcoma. After rescuing the villagers and Caroline, the vampire hunters proceed into the castle to destroy the remaining forces of dark.

Although the forces of evil reveal that they created Michel and Albert to kill themselves, they became afraid of death and tried to stop them. It is important to note the Hunters are in fact Dhampyrs (half-vampires), foreshadowed by their glowing eyes and sunglasses. The outcome is a pyrrhic victory for the forces of good; as the forces of evil are stopped, the Vampire Hunters decide to let the rising sun end their own lives as well.

The game ends with Caroline paying her respects to the Vampire Hunters at their graves.</desc>

With ferocity and ruthless efficiency, they descended upon the townfolk, enslaving them to work deep in the caves that surrounded their village.

Dark Yabu murdered the grandfather of the young Vexx, who managed to slip quietly aboard the enemy's windship. There, locked deep within Yabu's sanctum, was the last pair of Astani Battle-gauntlets. The gauntlets leapt onto Vexx's outstretched hands and bonded to his arms giving him special powers. Prepared to meet his destiny, Vexx embarks on a quest through volcanic islands, frozen citadels and giant castles to confront Dark Yabu, save his people and avenge the death of his grandfather.</desc>

With the addition of Brad Burns, Vanessa Lewis's alternate Muay Thai style from Virtua Fighter 4 was removed and replaced with a Vale Tudo "Offensive" style; making her a solely Vale Tudo brawler.

All of the stages were adjusted. For example, Lei-Fei's stage in Virtua Fighter 4 previously took place during sunset, in Evolution it takes place during the morning.</desc>

A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sport's name).

Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.

Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks. Co-operative mode has one player driving the boat while the other hangs on behind, with new challenges for the boat driver to complete as well as the rider.</desc>

		<desc>In War of the Monsters, players take the roles of large monsters in city environments. The game plays as a fighting game yet works differently than the traditional one-on-one structured rounds. Instead, fights can include up to 4 players in a four-way simultaneous fighting structure. The camera is in third person perspective, allowing the player to focus solely on their character.

Monsters have two status bars in each game, health and stamina. Like the standard fighting game formula, every time a monster takes damage, their overall Health bar drops until it is completely depleted, resulting in player defeat. Stamina determines how much energy a monster can attack with. The bar drops if a monster picks up another foe or performs a ranged attack. If the bar is full, a monster can perform special attacks, whereas if the bar is completely drained, they become temporarily immobilized.</desc>

		<name>Way of the Samurai</name>
		<desc>Way of the Samurai, known in Japan simply as Samurai (ä¾?) is a PlayStation 2 (PS2) action-adventure game developed by Acquire and released in 2002.

Set in 19th century Japan, the player takes on the role of a ronin who wanders into a remote village and becomes involved in a conflict between rival clans. A notable feature of the game is the branching storyline, which allows player decisions to radically alter the course of the story.

An updated version titled Samurai Kanzenban  was released in Japan in 2003. It features bug fixes and additional content. The game was followed by a number of sequels on the PS2. Way of the Samurai was also released on PlayStation Portable on September 18, 2008 in Japan; prior to the release of Way of the Samurai 3.[1]</desc>

Spanx has most standard platforming abilities, while Redmond is completely indestructible as a result of tests conducted upon him and so can be hurled into security guards, jammed into machinery, and used as a grappling hook, among other uses.

		<desc>Although it is essentially a remake of the original PlayStation version of Wild Arms, Alter Code F brings enhanced gameplay, improved graphics, and an expanded storyline to the PS2. Players take command of three unlikely companions in a surreal and desolate world called Filgaia. The young orphan Rudy has a unique ability to physically bond with "ARMs," or "Ancient Relic Machines," which seem to have been left behind by a forgotten civilization. The runaway princess Cecelia can command forces of magic, and the swordsman Jack is adept at a number of trades. These three "Dream Chasers" seek their fortunes in the unforgiving countryside, and might just end up saving the whole world along the way. The role-playing adventure includes overworld exploration and intense dungeon-crawling. Wild ARMs: Alter Code F is compatible with the PlayStation 2 HDD, so veteran PS2 gamers with older model consoles and the hard drive accessory can load the large, two-DVD game program to disk in order to decrease load times.</desc>

		<name>Wild Arms 3</name>
		<desc>The first two games in the Wild Arms series garnered attention and acclaim as they brought classic console role-playing to the original PlayStation. Though crafted in the same story-telling spirit, Wild Arms 3 (titled Wild Arms Advanced 3rd in Japan) boasts major technological improvements and a number of new gameplay elements. Featuring "stroke-shaded" animation-style graphics, a "Wild West" setting, and a completely 3D game engine (not just for battles, as in the previous games), Wild Arms 3 is designed to make good use of the power of the PlayStation 2.

Wild Arms 3 features four main characters and takes the time to let players become acquainted with each of them. The "drifters" Virginia, Gallows, Jet, and Clive are four very different adventurers whose paths intertwine toward a shared destiny. Though each has his or her own personal motivations, all four seek an explanation for why the once-verdant lands of Filgaia have become dry and barren. Differences must be overcome and the characters must act in harmony if they are to truly understand the ancient mystical forces at work.

As the drifters move through the desolate land of Filgaia, they are challenged with a number of mysteries to solve and barriers to overcome. The different special abilities of each character must be used to solve different parts of the game's complex puzzles. A technique dubbed "expressive communication" is designed to allow players to quickly gauge the moods and emotions of the onscreen characters. Monsters, villains, and other horrible creatures stand between the drifters and their destinations as well. The Wild Arms 3 turn-based battle system is designed to offer players an intricate level of control, allowing tactics that make wise use of the various powers and weaponry of the drifters while presenting combat with cinematic flair.


Wild Arms 3 delivers everything RPG gamers expect: an in-depth storyline, puzzling dungeons &amp; a unique battling system. Journey along with Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows and discover the mystery behind the Prophets to revive the memories of Filgaia. Explore dungeons to unlock secret pathways and find mythical treasures. Gun Blazing shoot-outs deliver intense cinematic battles. Wild Arms 3 embodies tried-and-true elements of a role-playing classic.</desc>

		<desc>You play as a young teenager named Jude Maverick. You live in a quiet village that floats high above the ground, unaware of the world that lies beneath it. But one day, your world is shattered to pieces, and you descend onto the earth to face the terrible reality: the world of Filgaia was devastated by wars. A few settlements amidst rusty tanks is all that is left of civilization. The democratically elected government has some plans for improving the conditions of the world, but as you meet a young girl whom they used as a tool for their purpose, you realize you must find a better plan to save her, and the world, from complete destruction.

The fourth installment of the Wild Arms series abandons its traditional Wild West theme and is set in a post-apocalyptic world. The gameplay system introduces hex-based battles. Battle screens are divided into seven hexes, each one of which can hold several party members or foes. You navigate your characters on the battle field, trying to force the enemy into an uncomfortable position. There is also a variety of skills you can learn and apply in battles to get benefits. As in previous Wild Arms games, the dungeons contain many environmental puzzles to solve.</desc>

Some new clubs were brought to their proper names (such as Manchester United instead of Man Red), while others have lose it (such as Chelsea which is now once again London FC). However, despite the names, players are correct as Chelsea does have Ballack and Schevchenko, Real Madrid now has Van Nistelrooy which was in Manchester United and so on.

Controls are the same, but moves and strategies have changed, as they tend to do from game to game. Fouls are not as easygoing as in previous game, but players turning is now too slow unless you know how to do it properly. Moves are much more realistic and goal keepers don't catch every ball with an ease, even easy one can sometimes slip by. That said, it all makes one step closer to reality, while it loses the reality factor on some other sides. Cameras are typical broadcast, tower, and bird-perspective, and cups, league and master league are still included.</desc>

Like WipEout 3, the game contains single-race and league modes, as well as two-player split screen gameplay. The single race mode (called Arcade) is used to unlock new tracks. The challenge mode from WipEout 64 returns with a few enhancements: each team has its own set of six challenges, which must be completed with a medal in order to unlock the next one. A new Zone mode requires players to drive as many loops as possible on a track while continuously increasing the speed.
Another new feature in WipEout Fusion are hovercraft upgrades. Depending on their performance, players receive credits after races, which can be used to increase speed, thrust, weapon power, shield strength, lateral stability, and brake force of a vehicle. Upgraded vehicles can be used in any other game mode, with the exception of the Challenge mode.</desc>

		<name>World Destruction League : Thunder Tanks</name>
		<desc>World Destruction League: Thunder Tanks is a car combat shooter game that has a similar gameplay to the Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8 series. Like Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8, the player must obtain "powerups" and defeat enemy vehicles, but must capture the enemy flags in order to win. However, all of the vehicles are tanks, hence its name. The game itself is short, making it quite unpopular among gamers. It was also one of the very first PlayStation 2 titles to be released. It is considered a spiritual successor to the Battletanx series, since it has similar gameplay to that as well, and is made by the same company, 3DO. Also a mototank from Battletanx: Global Assault can be seen in the opening title sequence, and many of the playable tanks are inspired or directly copied from Battletanx. A reversed M-80 (only in the PS1 version of Battletanx: Global Assault) can also be seen in game as the unplayable AI controlled Skorpion Bomb Tank.</desc>

		<desc>The official game of the premier poker tournament, World Series Of Poker allows you to take on some of the greatest poker players in 26 different poker games, earn WSOP bracelets and earn a place in the "WSOP Hall of Fame".

During tournaments, you take part in several tables en route to the final table. Each table consists of 8 players that are automatically replenished with new players when numbers dwindle. Once the tournament is down to the last 16, you move onto the "featured table", and once down to the last 8, you move onto the final table, where the winner will be decided.

Several famous poker players make an appearance in game including Chris "Jesus" Ferguson, Men the Master and Jennifer Tilly.</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay itself hasn't changed much from its predecessors, with the exception of the three-dimensional view, which allows the player more freedom, and more possibilities, to complete the task at hand. Modes like Campaign and Quick Match return from previous versions. The game also features a multiplayer feature, as well as the ability to edit and create teams. The objective of most of the matches is to eliminate the opposing forces' worms, whereas the Campaign mode gives the player sets of specific goals which he needs to complete.

The campaign consists of 35 small missions in which the player has to utilise their worms to complete a certain task, like destroy enemy worms, collect a certain crate, or even unique missions, like having to detonate 16 hidden landmines in a certain time. All of the missions give awards depending on how well you do. Gold medals usually unlock bonuses as for example maps, challenge missions, infos about weapons or voice banks. In the challenge missions in you have to use a weapon/utility to collect targets that add to your timebank which increases steadily. Getting a gold medal here unlocks maps or locked weapons.</desc>

Missions are now ranked based on how quickly they are completed, and fast times reward medals. By completing a bonus objective on hard mode, such as destroying traffic, a bonus mission will be unlocked. Earning a gold medal in a bonus mission will further unlock a cheat code, like unlimited time or low gravity. A free mode is available now too, allowing the player to drive through the city without worrying about a time limit. Finally two new features have been added to the cars: an adrenaline feature that slows down time, and a limited supply of short-range missiles.

A new multiplayer mode allows two players to play on a single screen, with the camera following the trailing player. Different modes are available, such as a mode where the trailing car attempts to ram the leading car, or a normal racing mode.</desc>

		<desc>WWE All Stars can be seen as a successor to WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game. Unlike the simulation-based WWE SmackDown vs. Raw games, it offers a more arcade-oriented gameplay, featuring elements of fighting games, with over-the-top moves and unrealistic animation. 

Similarly to versus fighters, the wrestling in the game is predominantly combo-based. The wrestler's signature moves are exaggerated, including nearly supernatural elements such as diving high into the air or slow motion moves. The game features popular WWE wrestlers from its time, such as Triple H, The Undertaker, Rey Mysterio, Big Show and John Cena, as well as WWF wrestlers from the past: Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, The Ultimate Warrior, Jake the Snake and the "Macho Man" Randy Savage.

The game includes a Path Of Champions mode, where players can choose a WWE Legend or Superstar to either become the WWE Champion, the World Heavyweight Champion, or the WWE Tag Team Champions.</desc>

One of the main changes in the game is the incorporation of a new physics system that allows objects to be used more realistically, such as objects involved in the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Tables now break differently depending on the impact placed upon them. Inside and outside the ring, ladders can now be rested onto the ring ropes and be broken in half. For the first time since the original WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw game, chairs can be thrown at your opponents.

The Hell in a Cell match is revamped with expanded cell walls, weapons underneath the ring, steel steps near the poles, and the cell door is removed. In addition, the game adds new ways to escape the steel cage.</desc>

		<name>WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006</name>
		<desc>This installment of the Smackdown series continues the Smackdown vs. Raw era, which now uses a yearly date in the title, similarly to other sports titles.

The game includes an updated roster of wrestlers, as well as many classic superstars like Bret Hart or British Bulldog. It also includes many new arenas from recent Pay-Per-Views, as well as a classic arena from Wrestlemania 9. A new recorded dialogue for many of the wrestlers is featured in the storyline, as the player goes through many different plots in the Season Mode, chasing the championship belts.

Gameplay has been slightly enhanced, with a larger list of moves available to each wrestler, and pre-match mini-games to start your fight off with and determine who has the upper hand.

Another addition is the General Manager Mode, where the player takes the role of a GM trying to book a weekly show. Taking into account costs to contract wrestlers, keeping a chosen wrestler happy and healthy, and putting on matches and setting up feuds to keep the ratings for the show high are the objectives of this mode.

It is also possible to earn Smackdown Dollars in the game, which the player can use to buy new moves, new create-a-wrestler items, Legends wrestlers, and even furniture to customize a locker room. The player can also earn trophies for his trophy case by completing challenges and beating the GM Mode.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2037. Ash is the leader of an elite organization of soldiers known as X-Squad. One day he receives a cryptic message concerning an experiment known as Project Medusa. It appears that the head of the project, Dr. Bianca Noble, has been kidnapped. Ash and his three companions must discover the truth behind the experiment, and find out who was behind the attack.

X Squad is a third-person 3D squad-based shooter. The player directly controls Ash; his three companions are controlled by the AI, but the player can issue general orders to them. Ash can crouch and roll to evade enemy fire. The gameplay is predominantly action-oriented; Ash and his friends have to deal with enemy soldiers, automated guns, and boss enemies. Other tasks are usually confined to hitting switches in order to open doors.</desc>

		<name>X-Men : Next Dimension</name>
		<desc>The control system of the game is heavily influenced by other popular fighting titles, such as Street Fighter, Dead or Alive, or Darkstalkers. The gameplay mechanics are tailored to a very gradual learning curve: super attacks are performed by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously, and multi-hit combos can be executed by pressing the punch and kick buttons in a particular order (a feature similar to Darkstalkers' chain combos). The game features an extensive combo system, including normal chains, air juggles, and air launchers. In addition to the basic blocking system, players have various counter attacks available to them that can be executed by simply pressing the counterattack button and a direction on the controller. The counter-attacks are specific to the type of attack the player is countering.

The fighting stages are fully 3-D rendered stages with their own layouts. As in Dead or Alive it is possible to knock an opponent to a different part of the stage, which functions as its own individual stage. In the X-Mansion, for example, an opponent can be knocked from the Hangar to the Hallway, then to the outer courtyard where, after the 2nd round, the basketball court opens up, allowing a player to be knocked back into the Hangar.

While in Story Mode, only a limited set of characters are available for each battle; Arcade Mode allows you to select from any of the playable characters in a series of eight battles. The Two-Player Versus Mode also allows players to choose from any of the unlocked characters. The game also features a Survival Mode, in which a single player is pitted against a never-ending flow of computer-controlled opponents in a test of endurance.</desc>

Nightcrawler is asked to infiltrate the remnants of William Stryker's base with his teleportation ability, since the weapons systems were somehow operational. Once inside, he finds out that Stryker had a backup plan to destroy the mutants â€” mutant hunting robots called Sentinels. Working together, Storm and Wolverine find an A.I. module for a Sentinel when agents of HYDRA (an organization of terrorists) arrive to take the remaining Sentinels to their own base. It is revealed that HYDRA had designed the robots for Stryker. Inside the base, Wolverine discovers that HYDRA had employed one of his former adversaries â€” Lady Deathstrike, who was able to survive an apparent death in X2 after being pumped full of adamantium.</desc>

		<name>Xenosaga Episode I : Der Wille zur Macht</name>
		<desc>Xenosaga: Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht, the first chapter of a trilogy, is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game, sharing many common themes and gameplay elements with Xenogears. The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's "boost" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts. 

Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.</desc>

		<desc>Xenosaga: Episode II - Jenseits von Gut und BÃ¶se is a direct sequel to the first episode of the science-fiction RPG Xenosaga series.

The story takes place thousands of years in the future, when mankind has long left the Earth, which is now called Lost Jerusalem, and founded a star empire. The main threat humanity has to face is the appearance of a super-powerful alien race called the Gnosis. The story picks up just after the concluding events of the first episode. Shion Uzuki, the young engineer who designed the powerful android KOS-MOS, arrives with her friends at the planet Second Miltia. They aim to learn more about the heritage of the late genius scientist Joachim Mizrahi, and foil the schemes of the mysterious antagonists Albedo and Margulis. Jin Uzuki, Shion's brother, who was only mentioned in the first chapter, becomes an important controllable character in the second episode. Much of the plot's content is dedicated to exploring the past and the origins of Jr., as well as his connection to Albedo.</desc>

		<name>Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum</name>
		<desc>This 3D board game consists of a series of duels, which are played with cards. The game has been split up in a Campaign Mode, in which you take on all levels of the Monster Coliseum on your own, a Free Battle Mode where you play skirmish matches against enemies defeated in the campaign, and a versus mode to take on a human opponent. Before starting, you have to choose a symbol, assign parameters to it (based on monster points, action points and power points) and buy a starter kit card deck.

In a typical campaign game, you start in the entrance hall, where you manage your cards and monsters. To duel, you choose one of the four areas with five levels each, and defeat the opponents. New monsters are acquired by winning the match. The turn-based duels are played as a card game. Both characters start with a deck of cards and a number of health points. When a health status reaches zero, the battle is over. You attack your opponent by summoning monsters and assigning abilities to them. Trick cards can be used to gain both offensive and defensive advantages. Before each duel, you have to pick a monster that is up for ante, and the fighting is influenced by various parameters, including the land form you are playing on.</desc>

During the battle, Dingo enters the BAHRAM battleship, seemingly defeating Nephtis, an Orbital Frame controlled by an A.I. program based on Viola's fighting style, but is subdued by Anubis, Jehuty's superior counterpart controlled by Col. Ridley (Nohman) Hardiman, leader of BAHRAM.

As a prisoner, Dingo is assaulted by Ken Marinaris, a female Orbital Frame runner that Dingo defeated in the previous battle. Nohman arrives moments later and asks Dingo to join him. When Dingo refuses, Nohman shoots him, ordering Ken to dispose of the body. Instead, Ken has Dingo revived and placed inside Jehuty. When he comes to, she explains that Jehuty is acting as a life-support system, and if he leaves Jehuty, he will die. She then tells him that she is a UNSF spy. Dingo escapes with Taper and heads for Mars.</desc>

		<name>007 : Agent Under Fire</name>
		<desc>CIA agent Zoe Nightshade, a mole in Identicon Corporation, based in Hong Kong, is discovered and captured. Identicon, a botanical research firm, is a possible front for a weapons-smuggling ring. James Bond infiltrates the facility in an attempt to rescue her, as well as retrieve a suspicious courier case in the same building. After freeing Nightshade from a submarine set to launch, the pair flee the facility with the courier case. Nigel Bloch, the head of Identicon, has his forces chase the agents through the streets of Hong Kong. The two steal a second case of vials from a nearby Identicon factory. They then rendezvous with R, who provides Bond with a gadget-laden BMW Z8. A limousine pulls up, as an assassin inside launches a rocket at the agents, killing Zoe, and steals the case. Bond gives chase, stopping an armored van which contained the stolen vials.

The vials contain nine blood samples, eight of which contained blood of world leaders. One contains the blood of British diplomat Reginald Griffin, serving in Romania, who is obsessed with protecting a room, outside of his jurisdiction, in the embassy. Bond investigates the embassy, finding Griffin dead, before a similar-looking man attacks him. After overcoming him, Bond finds a message from Bloch on Griffin's computer that mentions Malprave Industries, based in Switzerland. Bond takes the information from the computer and escapes.</desc>

		<name>007 : Everything or Nothing</name>
		<desc>The gameplay is a mix of third-person shooting/action sequences and vehicle sequences. In third-person, Bond can move, take cover, aim and shoot with a lock-on system, engage in hand-to-hand combat, use his spy gadgets and perform some context sensitive actions. The lock-on system has a precision aiming dot that can be moved with the right thumb stick to target specific areas of the body. It does not snap to said specific areas making it possible to completely miss your target.

A unique feature, "Bond sense", allows you to see the world how Bond does, allowing you to spot things that Bond can interact with. Using Bond sense slows down time so the player may have a chance to spot objects or enemies, but the player cannot move or take action without deactivating Bond sense.

Two players can play through a co-op campaign that uses some areas from the single player campaign but adds unique scenarios and maps to the mix.</desc>

		<name>007 : From Russia with Love</name>
		<desc>Building on 007: Everything or Nothing's range of strengths, 007: From Russia with Love is based on the 1963 film starring Sean Connery as James Bond. He is sent to Istanbul to acquire the Russian decoder machine known as the Lektor from a (supposedly) defecting Russian agent by the name of Tatiana Romanova.  However, the Russians have no knowledge of this plan because it is a trap for James Bond created by the criminal organization known as Octopus.  It is up to James Bond to seize the device and confront the dangerous assassin Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb.

In most of the 18 missions the player progresses through linear levels while shooting everything in sight. The player can lock onto an enemy at range and cycle between visible enemies, or focus in closer on a single enemy to make opportunistic targets appear, such as uncovered grenades or gaps in armor. Sometimes Bond can also use stealth or hand-to-hand combat, which are basically quick-time events where the player needs to press a displayed button in a limited time to dispatch a foe. Special tasks can be preformed with gadgets, e.g. the laser watch or a small remote controlled helicopter. This procedure gets spiced up with occasional driving or new jet pack sequences.

The player gets rewarded for certain actions with bonus points, e.g. succeeding in melee combat or searching containers. There are three different kind of points which unlock different things: bonus content like making of videos, bonus levels, and weapon upgrades. Every weapon and gadget can be upgraded in different areas, but only once.</desc>

		<name>18 Wheeler : American Pro Trucker</name>
		<desc>A port of Sega's 2000 coin-op title, 18-Wheeler for PS2 has players hauling cargo across four separate routes while competing against a rival trucker. The four routes consist of New York to Key West, St. Petersburg to Dallas, Dallas to Las Vegas, and Las Vegas to San Francisco. Players race from a view inside the cab of their chosen 18-wheeler, each rated in speed, torque, and toughness, and must reach a series of checkpoints within a time limit to keep on trucking.
 Points are earned based on three conditions: the time it takes to reach the finish line, the amount of cargo left intact after hitting objects, and whether or not players finished ahead of their rival. Completing the route before the competition unlocks one of three mini-games where players are challenged to park in specially designated areas within a certain amount of time. Finishing the objective reveals a horn, muffler, or engine to boost an 18-wheeler's performance.</desc>

187 Ride Or Die takes place in the "gangsta" universe, where you are "Buck", a young thug hired to take out the members of the opposing crew while on the road. The game provides a set of different cars, characters and weapons you can play with. Weapons take a large part in the gameplay: It is quite impossible to win races without using weapons. 

There are alternate mission types such as escort missions, car bomb, police escape (the only mode without weapon), and others. There are also deathmatch modes where the goal is to get the maximum of frags on other cars in arena style maps.</desc>

The actual racing game is based very heavily on Terminal Reality's Monster Truck Madness series of games, except with SUV's instead of monster trucks.

One significant feature of 4x4 Evo is the online multi-player option.  The Dreamcast, PC, and Macintosh versions can compete against each other in 4 player online races.

In addition to the on-line mode of play, there is a single player career mode.  The career mode gives you a small allotment of money with which to purchase a truck. You then can compete in races to earn more money for more trucks or performance parts for your current truck.</desc>

		<name>Ace Combat 5 : The Unsung War</name>
		<desc>Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War is a first person air combat and flight simulator. Like other Ace Combat games, each mission is determined by a level briefing and objectives. There are 32 missions in the main campaign mode, while an additional "arcade" mode puts the player in the role of Mobius One (from Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies) as he faces endless waves of enemy attacks. Regardless of the mode chosen, once in the air the player will have control over speed, direction, altitude, gun cannon, missiles and special weapon of their aircraft. A new feature from previous Ace Combat games, is the concept of Wingmen and being able to issue simple orders to them in the air. This allows the player to better coordinated group attacks as well as giving each wingman a personality of their own. Additionally, the player as squadron leader will be asked to make decisions ("Yes/No") while flying in the air. Between missions, the story is progressed through a series of cutscenes.</desc>

		<name>Ace Combat Zero : The Belkan War</name>
		<desc>This sixth installment in the Ace Combat series is a prequel to Ace Combat 5 that tells about the Belkan War eluded to in Unsung War. The story is told through the eyes of a reporter, 15 years after the altercation, uncovering secrets about the Belkan War of how it led to war, the outcome of the nuclear detonations within their borders and a near disastrous secret that nearly led to the destruction of a nation.

The main game mode is the story mode, in which the player takes control of an Ustio mercenary pilot, call-sign "Demon Lord", taking part of the said war, advancing missions and advancing in the story while doing it. The missions can be anything done airborne, and there'll be escort, assault and defence missions amongst others. Like in the previous games, the game isn't about simulation, but fast paced aerial combat in highly powered aircraft. More like Top Gun, and less like real world.</desc>

		<name>The Adventures of Cookie &amp; Cream</name>
		<desc>Cookie and Cream are two cartoon bunnies who are on their way home on the night before their clan's yearly moon festival only to find out that the moon has decided to run away, and if Cookie and Cream aren't able to find it, there will never be another festival. Fearing this, the duo sets out to make sure that it doesn't come true.

The Adventures of Cookie &amp; Cream is designed for cooperative gameplay with two players. The goal of each level is to get to the end in a limited amount of time. 
There is basically a straight road from A to B where the players have to overcome obstacles in their way. This includes standard platforming or puzzles which need both players to solve, e.g. one has to press a button so that the other can progress. Because the way is not the same for both characters the game uses a split-screen view. Power-ups increase the time limits but certain obstacles decrease it again if touched. There are overall 35 levels.

It is possible to play the game alone but then the player has to control both characters at once. The game also features a unique 4-player mode where each character is controlled by two people and one joypad.</desc>

During the game the player is directly in control of Darwin, but can also command the followers directly around him. These followers can be commanded to attack animals, carry items, or complete tasks such as building ramps and bridges. Finding items while exploring can increase Darwin's stats and the number of followers he can bring with him. Items can also be returned to Darwin's village to expand and upgrade the services available there, such as healing at the mess hall or recruiting additional followers at the bar.</desc>

		<name>Aeon Flux</name>
		<desc>Aeon Flux is a 3rd person action game inspired by the 2005 movie of the same name. The story takes place 400 years in the future after the majority of Earth's population has been wiped out by industrial disease. Only one city, Bregna, remains. The city is run by the group of scientists who had discovered the vaccine to prevent the disease, but a group of rebels known as the Monicans oppose their rule. 

You control the main character of the story, Aeon Flux. Aeon is a skilled fighter, and can perform light and heavy strikes, combo attacks, and a variety of acrobatic attacks. When an enemy has only a small amount of health left, you also have the ability to perform a takedown attack; when successful this will award you a bonus, such as extra health. Aeon has a health meter and a style meter; when the health meter is depleted, the game is over. The style meter is filled by attacking or killing enemies; when you have earned enough style, you can charge up your combo attacks for extra damage.</desc>

		<name>Agassi Tennis Generation</name>
		<desc>In this tennis game with the endorsement of former world no. 1 Andre Agassi, the player has 32 players (all male, of which Agassi is the only real player), every one with their own strengths and 16 tournaments around the world, each with their trademark court (so you can count on Carpet in St. Petersburg, Grass on London, Clay in Paris and Cement on New York). Three game modes are available: Quick game (a simple game where the players sets all options, from location to the participants), Arcade (beating a series of games in a row) and Agassi Tournament, where the player competes for the No. 1 spot. 

Gameplay is simple, as usual in most tennis matches. There are four buttons, controlling a simple shot, lob, top and back spin, and to win points, the player must be positioned correctly and add the right amount of direction and strength into the shot (by moving the d-pad). Serving uses a power bar where the player presses a key to toss the ball, and the bar fills up as the best time to hit the ball approaches, when the player hits the button again. Like in Virtua Tennis there are two views, the usual TV camera and a "behind the player" camera. Unlike other games published by Cryo in the Roland Garros series, the camera does not change so that the player is always on the bottom court.</desc>

		<desc>Borne in the same vein as titles such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and even Z-Axis' own Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX, Aggressive Inline is an extreme inline skating title with an emphasis on tricks, combos, and outlandish stunts. The game offers ten professional skaters to choose from in addition to a handful of original characters. In Career mode, players can select a virtual avatar from the likes of Jaren Grob, Taig Khris, Chris Edwards, Franky Morales, Sven Boekhorst, Sam Fogarty, Matt Lindenmuth, Matt Salerno, Eito Yasutoko, and Shane Yost and take him through seven levels, with the aim of improving skills and attributes along the way.
 Each character has a rating in seven different categories, ranging from jump to speed to wallride. By repeatedly performing specific tricks and moves, the relative attributes will gain more character points than other less-used attributes. Continued use of specific moves will thus improve the skill of your chosen skater.</desc>

Pilot aircraft that span sixty years of aviation including WWII prop planes, Korean War jets, rare prototypes, and even aircraft from previous Konami games like the Vic Viper and TwinBee.

Between missions you can explore the base and talk to wingmates, buy new aircraft and special weapons, modify or repaint existing aircraft, and get mission briefings. Missions can have varied objectives, but any enemy crafts shot down will reward money used to buy, modify, and repair aircraft. While Ken Thomas is the main character of the game, other pilots can be used in missions as the game progresses, and using them can open up bonus missions as well as alter the story. The player can only play as Delta Squadron pilots, but the story is told from the perspective of both E.D.A.F.'s Delta Squadron and their O.C.C. Ace counterparts. Medals are awarded to each pilot as they reach milestones, such as number of enemy aces shot down or number of aircraft purchased.</desc>

		<desc>The prestigious Alfa Romeo brand's cars feature in this racing game. There are several real tracks such as Hockenheim and Laguna Seca, as well as the chance to race in scenic Italian locations such as the Tuscanny hills and the Naples coastline. You can play Instant Action mode, in which you unlock these tracks one by one with indestructible cars, and Dynasty Mode, where you aim to build a more realistic career.

What sets the game apart from the crowd is its approach to driver abilities in Dynasty Mode. When setting a driver up, his abilities are split into skill areas such as reflexes and pressure-handling, with points assigned to these.  

Further skills such as Heart, Intimidation and Recovery can be developed to improve either car or driver. AI cars have the same features applied to them race by race.

The driver's heartbeat is a featured sound effect, and in pressure situations it can be heard above all other sounds. One available skill is the Tiger Effect, which allows you to rewind the game to avoid dangerous situations as they are about to happen. Its length and efficiency are 2 of the skills which can be improved.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the successful television show, Alias lets players take on the role of Sydney Bristow, a stealth operative working for the CIA. The game sets the player against two of Bristow's enemies from the original series in a plot which takes her from Saudi Arabia to Rio de Janeiro as she aims to find out about a mysterious device known only as "The Machine". The game was devised in conjunction with the writers from the show and uses official costumes, character shots and voices.

Players can use a stealth or action approach to get through the levels. With stealth Bristow needs to hug walls and use the correct timing to approach enemies from behind and knock them out. To accomplish this she has a few gadgets to her disposal, e.g. thermal vision or mini cameras. For the more direct method she uses guns found on neutralised enemies or melee combat. The latter knows different fighting styles depending on which weapon Bristow uses, e.g. knifes, unarmed or even a broom. There are also basic puzzles to solve, e.g. opening doors or a hacking mini game. Health regenerates automatically after a certain amount of time.</desc>

		<desc>You're a little yellow alien.  The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth.  And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep.  After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?

Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them.  The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible.  Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.</desc>

The featured game modes are Quick Play, Exhibition, All-Star Game, Season, Series, Home Run Derby and Batting Practice. Batting is cursor based, and you can choose between a power or a contact swing - for the latter there are even more options available, e.g. trying to hit the opposite field. Batting is similar in as you choose your itching style (every athlete can have up to six in his repertoire) and then choose the location. Fielding can be automatic or manual.</desc>

		<desc>The PS2 and Wii versions of Alone in the Dark follow the same plot as the game developed for Xbox 360 and Windows by Eden Games, but were created by a different company with their own vision how the game should be implemented.

Level structure, mechanics of gameplay, and looks of the characters (Sarah, especially) sometimes differ strongly as these versions contain concept elements that were left out of the other game. The driving sequences are almost entirely taken out. The first-person view is also mostly not used, and, for example, fire can be extinguished in the third-person mode. The basic aspects of screenplay are retained, but this can be considered another "what if" instalment in the series, rather than a canonical entry like the other version. The endings have a different look, but remain largely the same.</desc>

		<desc>Alter Echo is a third-person action game with a focus on close quarters combat. It is set in the 29th century where a substance named Multiplast replaces all known construction materials because it can be formed into anything. But something is wrong on the planet Proteus, the only known source of Multiplast. Now the simple worker Nevio has to investigate and stop the megalomaniac shape shifter Paavo who controls an even more powerful substance.

Luckily soon after the beginning of the game Nevo gets his hands on a special suit, which allows him to morph into three forms. The sword form is for melee combat, in which combos can be triggered by using the correct button combinations. The cannon form is a big robot which is more suited for gunplay and the stealth form is a futuristic lizard with a long tongue. During combat the player can instantly switch between the forms, which allows for many combinations depending on the former action or movement. This gets rewarded with plasma points which are used to upgrade Nevio's life energy, new moves or better weapons.</desc>

		<desc>Alvin and the Chipmunks is a game based on the movie with the same name. Alvin, Simon and Theodore must play at different venues to win the right to play at the battle of the bands event called "Rockathonapalooza." By clearing each venues in Story Mode, the player unlocks more venues to play at. The songs unlocked in Story Mode become available to play in Quick Play and Multiplayer or to watch in Video Mode. The gameplay is similar to Rock Band or Guitar Hero, but without the instruments. Using the controller's buttons, the player must hit the blue, pink, green and yellow Star Targets in sync with the music. Note streaks will give an up to 4x score multiplier bonus, but missing notes will deplete the Rockometer. The song fails if the Rockometer drops and turns completely red.

The track list includes songs such as:
The Chipmunk Song ? Alvin and the Chipmunks
Karma Chameleon ? Culture Club
All the Small Things ? Blink-182
Walkin' on the Sun ? Smash Mouth
Blitzkrieg Bop ? The Ramones</desc>

		<desc>In Antz Extreme Racing, the characters of the movie Antz are bored and start a racing championship. Each character has eight individual courses and challenges they must take on; besides the initial two the rest has to be unlocked by finishing the game with another character.  Like in most arcade racers there are various power ups to collect, e.g. rockets or protective shields. The game features four basic race types: driving the backs of larger bugs, running, flying on the backs of bugs, or surfing on a leaf.  

The game also can be played in four-player split-screen multiplayer.</desc>

		<name>Ape Escape : Pumped &amp; Primed</name>
		<desc>Sony Japan's quirky Gacha Mecha series returns to the States, thanks once again to publisher Ubi Soft. While there's still an abundance of loose, siren-helmet-wearing monkeys, this third Ape Escape game is made up of various athletic competitions
 Familiar characters return, and players will still find the games' assortment of unlockable power-ups and special equipment as useful as ever, but in Pumped &amp; Primed they may spend as much time racing through platform levels and duking it out in chaotic melee battles as they will sneaking up on escaped apes. 
 Ape Escape: Pumped &amp; Primed offers two main modes of play. The "Story" mode leads players through over 40 levels of athletically themed action, with eight boss battles. The "Versus" mode is designed for two to four (with a Multi-tap accessory) players, and presents more than 20 tournament-style party game challenges.</desc>

		<desc>Ape Escape 2 is the sequel to Ape Escape. In this platform game it's your goal to catch all the apes jumping, walking and flying around the diverse levels the game has to offer.

A large arsenal of gadgets can be used to make it all a little easier, with the catching net being the most important weapons of them all. Other gadgets include a RC Car, to drive over monkey's and collect objects, an Ape Radar, to detect the nearest monkey, a baseball bat, to hit monkeys unconscious, and a magnet, to move certain objects in the maps.

Your quest is to catch all monkeys in the levels and to stop the evil Specter from taking over the world. All monkeys in the levels are somewhat unique with their own character abilities and their unique name. Some monkeys just sit on their place, while others attack you with projectiles or run away quickly.</desc>

		<desc>Specter is back once again in the third main game in the Ape Escape series. With the help of a human scientist named Doctor Tomoki, Specter has turned the monkeys loose on TV. Even the previous heroes of the series - Jimmy, Spike, and the professor - are all caught up in the insidious TV shows.

Kei and Yumi take the lead as the new heroes. Their quest is to capture all 400 monkeys. You control either Kei or Yumi. The gameplay involves using various methods and weapons to catch them all. The game has many levels with different themes, such as a Haunted Castle, a Racing level, Jungle settings, TV studios and other settings. You can slow the animals down with various objects such as a stun club or a slingback shooter, and then you can capture them with a net. 

New to the series are the morphing abilities, eight in all. You can morph into various characters, like a knight and perform a powerful attack or a gun fighter and shoot em up or a ninja and run along walls. You can also vehicles such as a race car to knock down the monkeys. Other features are the familiar Monkeypedia and the unlockable Mesal Gear Solid mini-game (a Metal Gear Solid spoof).</desc>

By creating mountains from land-based pieces called "uppers," you can trap rain and water-based pieces to create lakes.
 If the mountains grow too high, a devastating earthquake may occur. If the water flows too freely across the land, you will ultimately flood your terrain and fail. You must balance these forces while dealing with other (sometimes helpful) obstacles such as bombs, fireballs, and ice cubes.</desc>

		<name>Aqua Teen Hunger Force : Zombie Ninja Pro-Am</name>
		<desc>This game is based on the animated Adult Swim show Aqua Teen Hunger Force, featuring the crime fighting trio of food items Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad.

Frylock had been admitted into the prestigious and exclusive Jersey Pines golf course... while Shake was rejected (he didn't actually apply, but that doesn't stop him from complaining about it). So, Shake decides to challenge Frylock in a game of golf just to prove that he's just as worthy as Frylock to be playing on that golf course. Who cares that Shake has no clue how to play golf? He's angry.

The game plays like a mix between a quite simplified golf simulator, an action game and has golf cart racing elements thrown in for good measure.

The game features lots of extras as well, such as 4 full episodes of the show (one of which is unaired), artwork and movie clips.</desc>

Long ago people had built up a great civilization under the guidance of the goddesses the Trio of Elemia, but over the years things have changed; there were two disasters that have lead towards the destruction of the world. In the first disaster most of the lands and skies were lost, in the second the super civilization was lost; now in the third era another disaster is beginning. Viruses born in the Altar of Apostles have begun to appear, though normally not in physical form have now taken on the form of monsters and could destroy the world. In the upper levels of the Tower is a city called Platina where the Knights of Elemia reside; their job is to control virus outbreaks to preserve the tower. One such knight is Lyner Barsett; the main character of the story, he will need to go on a quest to find the Hymn Crystal which can save the Tower of Ar tonelico and the whole world.</desc>

		<desc>SCE takes the Arc the Lad series away from its roots and into an Online-playable action-adventure game. Players become a hunter who must travel the world and take on jobs, usually revolving around taking out enemies in real time using magic and special abilities. Collect cards from battle and events and equip them to gain new skills, all the while following an RPG-like storyline. You view the action from overhead, with a camera zooming in and out depending on the intensity of the action and occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect. You attack enemies in real time, tapping X once for a simple attack and repeatedly for a combo. You can also guard against attack, dash at an enemy, and press a button to run about the play field faster. The game places heavy emphasis on magic use, with the magic meter recovering automatically and quickly following each spell.</desc>

		<desc>Arc: Twilight of the Spirits is the fourth entry in the Arc the Lad series. Like its two immediate predecessors, the game has tactical battles which allow free positioning and movement of the characters on the combat field. However, the game is closer to being a "regular" Japanese-style role-playing game rather than a tactical RPG. The player controls a relatively small party (up to six active combatants), and is able to explore towns and dungeons in a standard RPG fashion. In the beginning, the game puts the player into control of Kharg, but afterwards the chapters alternate between the human hero and Darc, each with his own party. Characters can use a variety of techniques, accumulating SP (spirit points) in battles and them using them to learn special attacks.</desc>

However, a dimensional rift begins to form over Tokyo. All of humanity's hopes now rest on the Maidens, young girls who can communicate with the Arcana.

The combat system consists of 4 buttons: weak move, medium move, strong move and special attack. Battles take place in two rounds, where the opponent's life gauge must be emptied. Various combos can be performed using the buttons and directional controls.

Each player has a "SUPER" bar divided into 9 levels. It fills up as you hit. It allows to trigger special moves called "Arcana Force" and "Super Attacks".

Several game modes are available:

Arcade mode, where you have to defeat opponents while following the narrative;
Versus mode, which allows you to play against another player;
Training mode, which allows you to practice;
Gallery mode, where you can access illustrations and animations.</desc>

The main object of the PS2 and Xbox versions is to upgrade sleds and unlock secret characters or tracks. You earn Gold Medals or lots of points to unlock most secrets, and you do this by winning races. The gameplay involves shooting down enemies with weapons, boosting yourself ahead, and pulling off tricks. Exclusive to the console versions is a Battle Mode that emphasizes the game's frantic combat.
 Like other titles in Midway's pseudo-series, such as Hydro Thunder and 4 Wheel Thunder, this snowmobile racing release combines distinctive environments and a responsive physics model with lots of arcade-style jumps and power-ups. Players race their snow machines across the Swiss Alps, up the Alaskan Pipeline and even through a nuclear energy plant in Chernobyl in a continuing effort to be first across the finish line. Also like others in the series, Arctic Thunder is full of extra sleds, tracks, and other secrets to be unlocked through skillful play.</desc>

		<desc>Inspired by the 1995 coin-op by Atari Games, which featured alien-blasting action with a light gun peripheral, Area 51 on PlayStation 2 once again finds players deep within the mysterious military base. Players assume the role of Lt. Nick Cross, a biohazard expert sent to investigate the strange happenings inside the famed research center. Cross soon resents his assignment, however, after being infected by a virus of alien origin. Now he finds himself slowly developing new abilities as a result of the alien DNA strands bonding with his own. Area 51 has been redesigned as a first-person shooter without the weapon peripheral, meaning players are free to explore the top-secret installation on their own without following a scripted path.
 Of course, players will be armed to the hilt with high-powered rifles, infrared sights, grenades, and various other tools of the trade. Along the way, secrets will be revealed in the areas of alien autopsies, cover-ups involving lunar landings, and experimental work on advanced technology like cloaking devices. With newfound superhuman strength and other biological enhancements courtesy of the virus, Nick Cross must battle aliens, soldiers, and other surprises while also solving puzzles. Area 51's creatures were designed by Stan Winston Studio, the effects team behind such films as Aliens, Predator, and Jurassic Park.</desc>

		<desc>Arena Football is a simulation of the sport of the same name.  It shares many similarities with the Madden Series, whose engine it uses, but has a different play-style thanks to Arena football's rather different rules.  The game is played indoors with teams of eight on a 50-yard field and the sidelines and uprights have barriers to make balls that would go out of bounds in standard American football bounce back into the play field.  It is still considered live at this point.  Obviously, this makes the game much faster-paced and higher-scoring.

Features include a coach's pick which will recommend plays, a telemetry view, which lets you see how tired both your players and the opposing ones are along with passing routes so you can set good match-ups, a quick play mode, a season mode, which allows you to go up to 20 seasons and trade players, set salaries, etc, practice and online play.

Arena Football is officially licensed by the Arena Football League and includes all the teams and players from the 2006 season.  New Orleans VooDoo is not included as they sat this season out due to hurricane Katrina, though their logo is available to use for created teams.  Numerous historic teams are also available.</desc>

Plastic, which is required for all normal units, is taken from everyday objects, including Frisbees, dog bowls, and toys. Additionally, whenever a unit or structure is destroyed, a chunk of plastic worth a fraction of its initial cost appears where it was destroyed. Plastic is 'harvested' by Dump Trucks. Electricity, which is required for vehicles and Radio operator equipment, is drawn from electrical objects, such as batteries, toasters, and walkie-talkies. A particular structure, the Resource Depot, must be built to collect the resources gathered by the Dump Trucks.</desc>

		<desc>Art of Fighting is a video game trilogy in the genre of competitive fighting game titles that were released for the Neo Geo platform in the early 1990s. It was the second fighting game franchise created by SNK, following the Fatal Fury series and is set in the same fictional universe as a prequel to the Fatal Fury series.
 The games follow the struggles of the students of the Kyokugen Karate Dojo, Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, in what appears to be the late 1970s. Ryo is the son of the Kyokugen Karate discipline's creator, Takuma Sakazaki, and Robert is the wayward son of a billionaire family from Italy. The initial two titles are set in South Town, a common location in SNK games that is also the setting for the Fatal Fury series, while the third appears to take place in a fictitious area of Mexico.</desc>

		<name>Astro Boy</name>
		<desc>He may be small, but only in size. This free-roaming platform adventure stars the original anime hero: the friendly, atomic-powered, robotic youngster called Astro Boy. This lad with "100,000 horse power strength and a heart of gold" has come a long way since his early-'50s debut in Osamu Tezuka's black-and-white comics and cartoons, as Sonic Team now brings him to life in full color, and in full 3D.
 Luckily for PS2 gamers, Astro Boy's 128-bit makeover leaves intact all of his most famous powers -- they'll need them. Players will make use of the hero's rocket feet, super-human hearing, "digibeam" finger lasers, and other amazing abilities, as they keep the peace in the futuristic metropolis of Metro City. It is here that the hero will face classic villains such as Acheron, Blue Knight, and Atlas. Additional powers are unlocked as Astro Boy accomplishes key objectives.</desc>

		<name>Astro Boy : The Video Game</name>
		<desc>This is a side-scrolling beat 'em up and shoot 'em up combo based on the 2009 animated 3D movie of the long-running character from manga and anime. Astro Boy must save Metro City from President Stone and his robots while fighting through levels on the ground and in the air. In addition to fighting combination moves, he can shoot a laser from his fingertip and use a special attack if the energy meter is powered enough.  These include an Arm Cannon, Butt Machine Guns and Absorb (recharges a portion of health). Find different power-ups and costumes in hard to reach and hidden areas. 

In addition to singleplayer, there is 2-player multiplayer co-op on Wii and PS2 where the second player controls another Astro Boy with a different costume.  In Story Mode, if one person dies, they can later rejoin game with full health after some time elapses. But if both die, then the game is over and must be started over.  There's also an Arena mode where both players fight with robots to determine a winner with the most points.</desc>

		<desc>In the land of Regallzine, there is a special guild of alchemists - people who possess magic powers they draw creatures called "mana". The alchemists are able to manipulate elements and to fuse magical items. One of such alchemists suddenly got the idea of resurrecting an ancient god, claiming it will bring peace and happiness to humanity. To stop the madman, another alchemist, a young man named Klein, enters the scene. Klein is a particularly skillful magic user and has his way with mana, so with the help of his powers he hopes to stop the planned resurrection and to save the world.

The gameplay features traditional turn-based battles against randomly encountered enemies and a role-playing system based on the spiritual mana creatures. The characters use mana to create magical items and also equip it to learn special abilities and to gain bonuses when leveling up. Some mana creatures must be given gifts in order to obey you and to become more powerful. Mana-equipping can also grant you physical abilities which you can use to solve puzzles in dungeons.</desc>

		<name>Iris no Atelier : Eternal Mana 2</name>
		<desc>The story of Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny follows Viese and Felt, two orphans from the land of Eden. At the beginning of the story an earthquake has caused vast portions of the land to disappear! Viese and Felt have volunteered to find out what has happened and to prevent the world of Eden from being destroyed completely. With the aid of a magical sword called the Azure Azoth, Felt sets off through a gate to another world called Belkhyde to search for the answer to their trouble while Viesa remains in Eden to take care of things there.

Throughout the game you control Viesa and Felt on their quest. Viesa has just become an alchemist; with the help of the Mana spirits of the world, this gives her the ability to take various items and magically form new items. In order to create a new item, Viesa will need a recipe indicating what ingredients to combine as well as those ingredients. All of these items can be found in various locations throughout the lands, some in Eden and some in Belkhyde. Many of the items Viesa can create with alchemy will be of great help to Felt as he explores Belkhyde and fights in battles; since Felt doesn't have the ability to create items, they will need the help of a share ring which provides the ability to exchange items even though they are in two different worlds. To progress through the game, Felt will often need to coordinate with Viesa to get useful items for either solving puzzles or making battles easier. As Felt explores Belkhyde, he will meet numerous other characters and will need to undergo various quests in order to save Eden.</desc>

		<desc>ATV Offroad Fury 4 is the fourth and final game in the 'Offroad Fury' franchise, released on Playstation 2.

Unlike the previous three titles in the series, this game strays from just simply ATV's in it's roster of vehicles. Offroad Fury 4 introduces MX bikes, dune buggies, and trophy tricks into the mix. The game also differs from it's predecessors in that it includes long point-to-point tracks, which utilize streaming technology to immerse the player in a huge seemingly-endless world. The other notable departure from the previous titles is the inclusion of a career mode, which attempts to include a story between races using rendered cutscenes.</desc>

		<desc>Capcom combines classic street-racing gameplay with highly-stylized graphics in Auto Modellista. While cel-shading creates a distinctively cartoonish look, the believable physics and rich detail are designed to drive this game far beyond standard Saturday morning fare. Players can choose a car from a number of licensed Japanese manufacturers, including Honda, Mazda, Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and others. Once a favorite car is selected it's time to hit the streets, for organized competition or pick-up dragging.
 Winning players earn the opportunity to upgrade their cars by adding new parts and kits. Like the cars themselves, the game's urban areas are all modeled after real-life locations in Japan. To offer more extensive enjoyment of Auto Modellista's distinct look, players can enter a special "VJ" mode to enhance their replays with camera angle cuts, special effects, and music.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the animated television program of the same name, Avatar: The Last Airbender follows the adventures of a group of kids living in an Asian-inspired fantasy world where the nations have been divided up according to the four classical elements: Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. Within each nation are people who can control that one element, known as benders. The Avatar is a person who can control all four elements, and is charged with keeping peace between the four nations. However, 100 years previous the Avatar had disappeared, making it possible for the Fire Nation to wage a war of conquest across the world. As the show begins, the new Avatar, Aang (originally an Airbender, hence the title of the series), has been found, and now he must travel the world, learning how to bend all four elements and fighting against the Fire Nation alongside his friends Katara (a Waterbender of the Water Tribe) and Sokka (her older brother).</desc>

		<name>Avatar : The Last Airbender - Into the Inferno</name>
		<desc>Based on the third and final season of the acclaimed, anim?-influenced action series, Into the Inferno follows Aang and his friends while they prepare to make their final stand against the Fire Nation. As a fateful comet nears its return to the world, the Last Avatar must find a way to bend the terrible powers of Fire Lord Ozai's armies -- and the raw power of fire itself -- away from the ultimate domination and destruction they imminently threaten.
 From an isometric perspective, players guide Aang, Katara, Sokka, and other characters in martial arts combat and through 3D action sequences. Each character fights in his or her appropriate style, employing the powers of air, water, earth, and fire, as in the animated series. Characters can also ply their various elemental bending powers to alter the environment to their advantage, and may need to do so in order to progress through certain key stages.</desc>

		<name>Backyard Baseball '10</name>
		<desc>Backyard Baseball '10 is a baseball game that features all 30 Major League Baseball teams as well as 11 "Backyard" teams (6 in the DS version). The player can pick a team, players and one of the 12 different fields to play on. The game combines traditional baseball mechanics such as pitching and batting with the ability to use power-ups.

Some of the power-ups include:
Screaming Liner - The ball is hit so hard it screams
Orbiter - The ball cannot be hit any harder; almost a guaranteed home run when hit
Popcorn Bunt - Confuse the defense by making a bunch of other balls appear on the field
Slime Ball - The ball is covered in goop and no one can catch it or throw it
Free Radical - The ball bounces around a few times, making it really hard to catch
Teleporter - The ball teleports on the field a few times before stopping somewhere on the field
Static Zing - The ball is electric and will shock the first person to touch it
Meteor Ball - The ball is thrown so fast that it's hard to see!
On the PlayStation 2, the game uses traditional button-based controls. On the Wii, the player can swing the Wiimote to bat and pitch. On the Nintendo DS, there are two control modes. The player can either use the control pad and the B button or tap/swing the stylus on the touchscreen to pitch/bat.</desc>

You will be accordingly rewarded on your successful actions and achievements on a "Bad Boy" rating system.

		<name>The Bard's Tale</name>
		<desc>The Bard is a cynical, opportunistic musician who roams the country in search of carnal pleasures. However, this impatient and selfish fellow is compelled to accept the greatest quest of his life: save the princess Caleigh from a demonic cult that has kidnapped her. The unlikely hero must now explore the land in search of the princess, accompanied by the omnipresent Narrator who obviously can't stand the Bard and uses every opportunity to sarcastically comment on his actions. Furthermore, Fionnaoch, the mysterious abductor of the princess, does everything he can to stop the Bard, sending his minions after him.

A self-proclaimed "quest for coin and cleavage", The Bard's Tale is an action RPG that is more of a whimsical take on role-playing games than a remake of the classic series. As the Bard, players can fight off hordes of foes with blade and bow, and summon companions through magical Bard Songs. Leveling up allows the player to raise the character's main attributes and invest specialization points in the different types of weapons he can use. Magical companions must be sought out and then summoned during battles. After being summoned, they act pretty much like AI-controlled party members; some of them specialize in physical attacks and offensive spells, while others can heal the hero.

During conversations the player can choose "nice" or "snarky" responses for the protagonist. While mostly used for humorous effect, some of these responses may affect subsequent events. The game uses the Dark Alliance engine and has a similar camera and control scheme.</desc>

		<name>Batman Begins</name>
		<desc>Step into the shadows of Gotham City's perilous criminal underworld as DC Comics' legendary Dark Knight in the Batman Begins video game. Slated for release day and date with the Warner Bros. Pictures film, Batman Begins challenges players to use fear as their ultimate weapon.
 A hero is born, in this interactive adaptation of Christopher Nolan's 2005 comics-inspired cinema. Based directly on the movie, the Batman Begins video games are designed to allow players to discover the Batman as for the first time, by exploring the roles of both young Bruce Wayne and his fledgling alter ego.
 In addition to the combat one would expect from any adventure featuring the grim hero, gameplay involves exploration and stealth. Batman's famous utility belt comes into play, as different gadgets allow him to reach remote areas, survey situations from a safe location, and unleash surprise attacks. The film spotlights its heavy-duty interpretation of the Batmoblie, as well, and the highly versatile vehicle is featured in the game's combat racing sequences.</desc>

		<desc>In the future, on the planet Allium, the situation has become desperate. This world has suffered from global warming, causing the polar ice caps to melt. The rising sea has resulted in the amount habitable land to decrease dramatically. All that is left are island chains, making land the most valuable resource on the planet. The entire population  must survive and compete over these islands.

Currently, there are two distinct civilizations on Allium, settled into an uneasy cease-fire. There are the scientifically advanced Forseti and the aggressive Muspell. The Forseti have recently developed the most advanced combat vehicle in existence, the Battle Engine Aquila. The Aquila is both a four-legged mechanized tank and a combat jet, it is capable of switching modes at will. Players take the role of Hawk Winter, a Forseti cargo loader operator who has been conscripted because of his piloting skills.</desc>

Instead of a traditional season mode as in many other baseball simulations, in The BIGS there is a mode titled Rookie Challenge, where the player creates a ballplayer and tries to lead him and his team to the World Series. Another mode, Home Run Pinball, puts a hitter in the middle of Times Square, New York, with the aim to hit balls into windows and neon lights.</desc>

		<desc>On Mars, a battle wages on between the race of mice, known as the Martian Freedom Fighters, and the invading Catatonian Empire. Both sides are fighting for the rights of one important machine: the Regenerator. This machine has the ability to terraform Mars, creating a safehaven for all mice. The Catatonians wish to claim it so they can take over the planet. Freedom Fighter General Stoker is the only one who knows how to build the Regenerator. As a result, he is not present on the battlefield, but is instead on Earth looking for molecules vital to the device's construction.

The mice later mysteriously lose contact with Stoker, so another general, Carbine, sends the Biker Mice from Mars. After their arrival, they land in Chicago and meet up with Charley Davidson, who runs and owns the Last Chance Garage, which becomes the Biker Mice's base of operations. Not long afterwards do they realize the Catatonians, led by General Hairball and Cataclysm, have come to Earth in search of Stoker, so that they can ensure their claim of the Regenerator. Evil billionaire Ronaldo Rump (a parody of Donald Trump and Ricky Ricardo with an oversized butt) also seeks Stoker, since he owns a Regenerator of his own, and uses it for his evil money-making schemes, but it is running low on power.</desc>

		<desc>Newton's third law is put to the test in Black, a first-person shooter from the development team behind the acclaimed Burnout franchise. Players are cast in the role of Jack Kelar, member of an elite tactical squad, whose team is assigned to Eastern Europe on a hunt for an American traitor. Rather than slinking through environments making quick, covert strikes, players in Black perform a full-on assault through nine levels of explosive action.
 A total of 13 cutting-edge weapons are available to eliminate the enemy threat, but the most distinguishing aspect of Black is its physics engine: fully destructible environments allow players the freedom to shoot inanimate targets as well as live ones. Instead of firing at a patrol of soldiers, for example, players can instead target nearby vehicles or barrels to trigger explosions, shoot out windows and balconies, and more. As Kelar blasts through the besieged cities, snow-covered wilderness, and other levels, shell casings, glass, dust, and debris will fly across the screen as plumes of smoke and raging fires dot the war-torn landscapes.</desc>

		<name>Blitz : The League</name>
		<desc>Blitz: The League is the first football game with no NFL license in many years - because EA signed an exclusive deal with the NFL, Midway developed one without the license. The game has 17 fantasy teams all with their own look and feel - from personalities to logos. 

The game differentiates itself further from official games by giving the players an off-field presence, often involving sex, performance-enhancing drugs and violence. The game has input from the writer for Playmakers, the football-based soap opera the NFL forced ESPN to cancel.

Blitz: The League has 8-man teams, and makes spectacular action-packed moves easier than in real life. Impressive moves boost your Clash meter, which allows you to pull off unrealistic moves, such as easier running due to Bullet Time, and some brutally tough defences tackles. If these tackles happen frequently enough the players will fight hockey-style, lunging into wild tackles. The team with the most tackles from this gains the Unleashed mode, which has even more gruesome moves, of a style the NFL would not allow to be associated with their product.

Additional features include multiplayer action with head-to-head online play and complete customization options of players, teams, stadiums and more. Lawrence Taylor appears as the poster boy.</desc>

		<name>Blood Omen 2 : The Legacy of Kain Series</name>
		<desc>The Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 is a third person action game with adventure elements, more similar in perspective to Soul Reaver than the first Blood Omen game. The player controls from behind Kain's shoulder and can move him in different directions, attack, jump, use "dark gifts" and grab on to ledges. Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game, by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform "stealth kills" which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands, or by picking up daggers, swords, axes and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and can also be thrown at enemies from afar.</desc>

The cause was unknown, but as the Crest Incident came to an end and the rioting and earthquakes subsided, people began to claim that all was due to the influence of the Stone Seal. Although the Stone Seal has been locked away, the rioting and earthquakes have returned. This time, the incidents are on a larger scale than those of a year ago. 
Bloody Roar 4 is the last title in the series, and is once again a full-3D fighting game featuring the series' trademark transformation abilities. Unlike previous titles in the series, the beast gauge now acts as its own health bar; if a character's health gauge is depleted, they will automatically transform. The game features 18 playable fighters and a variety of game modes, including standard arcade, versus, time-attack, training, and survival modes.</desc>

You travel around each level in a non-linear fashion.  You have to fight your way through endless hordes to find keys, flip switches, use elevators, and then ultimately defeat a big boss at the end.</desc>

The "Hardcore Tour" mode has you playing the levels, pulling off tricks and completing goals to unlock things such as new levels or stripper videos. The goals are of the odd variety, including things like collecting yellow snow for an icecream man, or gathering empty cans for a homeless guy. Also have to watch out for a health bar which accounts for your injuries and can make you start over levels if you run out of it.

Do well enough in the game and you unlock a topless mode, where the riders are all.. well.. 

There's also a 'create-a-ride' mode, and a two player split screen option, with different games of its own. The game plays on Acclaim's own Dave Mirra series' engine.</desc>

		<name>Boogie</name>
		<desc>Boogie is a dance and Karaoke game. Unlike most similar games, which use special pads to control the dancing, the Wii version makes use of the Wii remote. The nunchuck can also be used to control the facial expressions in Strike-a-pose sequences, but is not required. For karaoke, Boogie includes a USB microphone. Each song can be played as a dance or a karaoke game. Players either match the rhythm and pitch, or match the song's beats to dance. Variation and combos are encouraged, as too many similar moves will lower the score. By performing well in the dances, a Boogie meter is filled. When full the player can execute a special move. While dancing, bonus items appear such as multipliers, tokens and meter boosts.

The game features a story mode centered around an intergalactic singing and dancing competition. There are five different characters, each with a unique story. For all other modes of play, players can create custom avatars based upon the five base characters, with a chapter in the story mode for each of them. Token collected during gameplay can be traded in for new songs, stages and outfits. There is also a mode where players can manipulate the camera to record their own music videos.</desc>

		<desc>Bratz: Forever Diamondz is a 3D game staring the Bratz girls, based on the 2006 direct-to-DVD film of the same name. The girls from Bratz magazine (Cloe, Jade, Sasha and Yasmin) compete in a contest across the United States against the girls from Your Thing Magazine (Burdine, Kirstee and Kaycee) to find an undiscovered teen fashion designer for the 'America Rocks Fashion' TV show competition. The winner of the competition will then receive a contract with a famous fashion designer and a pair of go-go boots covered with diamonds. 

In the game you take control of one of the Bratz girls while exploring the towns you visit while searching for the teen designer. During the game you switch between the girls and can customize their clothes, jewelry and make up. The player will participate in photoshoots, ice skating and can adopt a pet.</desc>

		<name>Bratz : Rock Angelz</name>
		<desc>Bratz: Rock Angelz chronicles the adventures of the 4 main Bratz franchise girls -- Jade, Sasha, Chloe, and Yasmin -- as they follow their globetrotting fashion dreams on their way to start a world famous rock band. It starts when Jade receives a dream internship at a high fashion magazine with a tyrannical editor-in-chief who also employs twin sisters who happen to be Jade's arch-nemeses. Jade does not last long at this internship. She and her friends decide to found a competing fashion magazine and the adventure rolls on from there.

The game features 9 chapters and the gameplay alternates between 3D adventure and assorted minigames. In the 3D adventure mode, the player guides the current Bratz character around various rendered sets and interacts with other characters, who invariably give the Bratz goals to carry out in order to further the storyline.

The minigames include a fruit smoothie mixing game, where the player controls the smoothie stand and must make fruit smoothies per the Bratz girl's real-time specifications; a magazine layout minigame; a minigame where the player must pick out the right clothes for the editor's business trip; and many others. Successful completion of a minigame unlocks more outfits that the player can dress the Bratz characters in.</desc>

		<name>Brave : The Search for Spirit Dancer</name>
		<desc>Brave is a young native American boy who lives in the forest. As he wants to become a warrior, the elderly shaman Grey Bear prepares an adventure and hides carvings that will grant him new skills. During the search, however, the village is brutally attacked by the demonic creature Wendigo. Brave is the only one who can defeat it, but in order to do that, he has to track the path of the mysterious shaman Spirit Dancer, discover his past, and find the means to defeat the evil force.

Brave is a 3D third-person platformer with puzzles. Set in worlds with different themes (ice world, volcanic world, wastelands, forest...), Brave can roam freely, but certain parts are only opened up after solving quests. The boy can jump, duck, climb, and do basic attack moves. While observing, for certain actions, and when using ranged weapons, a first-person view is available as well. During the adventure, Brave acquires new abilities, which allow him to track creatures by smell or their tracks, mimic animals' sounds to lure or distract them, summon creatures, or invoke shaman powers to become an animal (an eagle, a bear, a rabbit and even a skunk).</desc>

		<name>Breath of Fire : Dragon Quarter</name>
		<desc>Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter is a radical departure from the previous titles of the Breath of Fire series, and in some ways from standard Japanese-style role-playing games in general. The game is built like a huge dungeon crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is tactical: each character has action points (AP), which can be used to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in the game, and many of the items found in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on who first initiated a physical contact, the party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles.

The game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart it from the beginning, keeping the items and the party experience. The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is over. Raising the D-ratio allows characters to access new areas every time the game is replayed.</desc>

		<name>Brothers in Arms : Earned in Blood</name>
		<desc>The story is essentially told as a "reflection" on the events that took place earlier, as Army historian Colonel S.L.A. Marshall is interviewing paratroopers 15+ days after D-Day. The story is divided into three parts. The first part of the game is recollection of Hartsock's time in Sergeant Matt Baker's squad during the initial D-Day invasion. The second part picks up when he takes command of 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon during the liberation and defense of Carentan, and the eventual link up between 82nd and 101st Airborne Division at the town of Baupte. The final part will take place in and around Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte. Although the first part takes place under Baker's command, every mission is one not included in Road to Hill 30. The player commands Desola, Allen, and Garnett from 3rd Squad, and some soldiers from 2nd Squad at first. Then the game switches the player to command the entire 2nd Squad after the Battle of Bloody Gulch (Hill 30).

Hartsock's squad consists of the remains of the original 2nd Squad (Cpl. Franklin Paddock, Pvt. Dean "Friar" Winchell, and Pfc. James Marsh) and the remnants of 1st Squad (Cpl. Jacob Campbell, Pvt. Will Paige, and Pvt. Derrick McConnell). In addition, the player will also be in command of Corporal (later promoted to Sergeant) Seamus Doyle of the 82nd Airborne during the initial D-Day invasion in early parts of the game.</desc>

		<name>Brunswick Pro Bowling</name>
		<desc>Brunswick Pro Bowling is a bowling simulation game. In Career mode, after creating an avatar, players compete against the computer to work their way up from amateur to professional. The player character will increase in skill (e.g. strength, accuracy) and earn money while playing. This money can be used to buy clothing or a new bowling ball, which also affects skill. Quick Play mode, as the name suggests, allows for a  quick round of bowling for one to four players.

Making a throw is a little bit different depending on the platform the game is played on. Lining up on the alley to decide the direction of the ball stays the same, but on PlayStation 2 and PSP it's also necessary to set its spin. The next step is rolling the ball. On the Wii this is done by swinging the Wiimote and releasing the trigger button, where the speed of the release determines the spin of the ball. In the other versions a sickle-shaped meter is shown; pulling down on the analog stick sets the accuracy, and pushing it forward the strength of the release.</desc>

		<name>Bully</name>
		<desc>Bully is a subtle sandbox game set in a school environment. The player takes control of teenage rebel James "Jimmy" Hopkins, who from the opening cutscene is revealed to be a difficult student with a disruptive background. The game concerns the events that follow Jimmy being dropped off at Bullworth Academy, a fictional New England boarding school. The player is free to explore the school campus in the beginning and, later on in the game, the town, or to complete the main missions. The game makes extensive use of minigames. Some are used to earn money, others to improve Jimmy's abilities or get new items.

School classes themselves are done in the form of minigames, broken into five levels of increasing difficulty. Each completed class brings a benefit to gameplay. English, as an example, is a word scramble minigame, and as Jimmy does well in this minigame, he learns various language-skills, such as the ability to apologize to police for small crimes. Chemistry also an example, is a button pushing minigame, and if Jimmy does well, he gains the ability to create firecrackers, stink bombs, and other items at his chemistry set in his room at the dorm.</desc>

		<name>Burnout</name>
		<desc>Burnout is a arcade style racing game in the mold of the Test Drive or Need For Speed series. In this game, you are racing on realistic streets with real traffic to contend with.

There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA. There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups. However, they are not based on real makes and models.

One notable feature of Burnout is the "Burn Meter." The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners. Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.</desc>

		<name>Burnout 2 : Point of Impact</name>
		<desc>Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing. Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure. Designers have built an entire city and surrounding areas, and implement the race courses throughput the countie's streets. As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races. As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving. Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost "burnout" meter. Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to dive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way. The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!</desc>

The more cars you take out, damage you inflict, the more events and cars you can unlock. Burnout 3 also has a "crash" mode which puts your vehicle at a variety of traffic junctions jam-packed with moving vehicles and pickups to see just how much monetary damage you can inflict.

Burnout 3: Takedown continues the racing series with more cars, more tracks, a more detailed crash engine, and a multitude of new gameplay modes for single players, multiple players on one system, and online play.</desc>

		<name>Burnout Dominator</name>
		<desc>Burnout Dominator is a racing game developed and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. Burnout Dominator is the second spin-off game in the Burnout series and sixth overall. It retains the core gameplay of the series, as players race at top speeds through dozens of World Tour events testing "reckless skill-based" driving techniques. The versions for each platform do not interact with each other.
This is the only Burnout game that was not developed by Criterion Games, and the first Burnout game in the series since Burnout 2: Point of Impact to not feature the "Crash Mode". At the time Dominator was being developed, Criterion was busy working on Burnout Paradise and was waiting to re-introduce the mode in a new form for the latter title. However, Criterion Games are listed as "the makers of this game" in the game manual and credited as developer on the official Electronic Arts site.</desc>

		<name>Burnout Revenge</name>
		<desc>In Burnout Revenge, players compete in a range of racing game types with different aims. These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many "Crash Dollars" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as "traffic checking", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a "checked" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on.</desc>

There are two game modes that can be played. In each of the game modes, create a hunter and choose from three difficulty settings. Open Season mode will allow you to quickly hunt or fish in any unlocked area. Adventure mode is the main mode of the game and is the true Alaskan experience. In this mode, travel to each region and visit the outposts to acquire the proper gear including clothing and tents. You will be able to go on hunts, fishing challenges and special contests. Try to unlock new regions, new gear and try to win trophies for prize catches.
When hunting, choose from an array of firearms including rifles, shotguns, muzzleloaders, handguns and bows. Grab a pair of binoculars to scan out the area or use a scope for more accurate aiming . Game calls, decoys, scents and lures will also help aid in your hunting experience. Big game animals range from Kodiak Bears and Musk Ox to Barren Ground Caribou and Mountain Goats. Also available to hunt are small game animals such as coyotes, beavers and even birds.
Fishing will take you all over Alaska trying to catch Salmon, Arctic Graylings and other Alaskan species. Use the correct bait and lures in the proper areas to make the catch. You can choose from ice fishing, spin fishing and fly fishing with a number of rods and reels to choose from.</desc>

		<desc>Another in the Big Game Hunting series, 2005 Adventures brings you 36 big game animals in 10 locations.  Choose from many guns, bows, equipment, and clothing before heading out to take on these animals.

Head out looking for whatever animal(s) you have tags for.  Track your target through mountains, plains, hills, streams, and lakes.  Swim across lakes and streams that are in your way and drive various vehicles to save time getting where you're going.  Once you find your prey, get close enough to shoot without your target noticing you.  Then take the shot!

Play the game in quick hunt or career mode, or play with friends online.  Go to your cabin to see the animals you have shot in career mode... you can even choose your what cabin you want out of six choices!

Unlike many other hunting games that have you go out and kill what you can in a single day, you can take as many days as you need to bag your limit.  Use tents to sleep away the nights, or walk around looking for possible spots to sit and wait for prey on the following day... just don't forget to eat and drink to keep up your energy.

Play through rain and snow as well as clear weather conditions.  Animals behave differently in different conditions, just like in real life.</desc>

		<desc>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts is a hunting game with adrenaline - hunt or be hunted! Many of the animals you'll be after are dangerous and aggressive and will take you one-on-one - and you'll be armed with a primary weapon as well as a knife or pistol for close combat defense. You'll hunt for 27 animals in 12 regions. Animals include dangerous species such as bears, wolves, leopards, rhinos and cape buffalo; big game species such as moose, bighorn, mountain goat, elk and caribou; and exotic species such as impala, duiker and kudu. The regions include British Columbia, Colorado, New Mexico, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Game modes include Quick Hunt (one tag, one animal, one region), Action Zone (warp from location to location, where dangerous animals are waiting to attack you), and Career Hunt (a series of missions where you have some choice as to which task you'll take on next, and unlock chartered hunts).</desc>

		<name>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2</name>
		<desc>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2 is a hunting game focused on linear story-based gameplay, instead of the freeform hunting of the main Cabela's line. You will hunt 20 animals, including lions, tigers, and bears, across 12 main levels, and 4 hidden levels. There are three difficulty levels, and a slow-motion ability to help line up shots. Keep your eyes open; there are secret stumps in each level, which if shot can unlock extra levels and other items. In most levels, you will be assisted by a native guide, who will both draw the attention of the local wildlife, and assist you in killing them.

The story features you, a world famous hunter, who has just found out a old friend, Bullseye Bill, is missing. Retrace his steps around the world, helping other people along the way.</desc>

		<name>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2009</name>
		<desc>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2009 puts the player in the shoes of Flint Abrahams, a famous hunter who travels around the world in search of hunting challenges. The player spends much time exploring the wilderness looking for traces of prey. Because they can be hard to make out, a Hunter's Sense is included to reduce the world to grayscales and make animals stand out. The game however maintains an arcade approach and lets the player shoot everything in his way, without regard for a patient approach.

The game's Career mode has timed levels forcing quick gameplay, and the different stages are set all around the world. When facing larger animals such as bear or lions, a Hand-to-Claw Combat mode is often triggered automatically to fend them off through a number of quick time event key presses. Another option is the Adrenaline mode where time comes almost completely to a stop, making it easier to line up the shots and get a lot of kills.

Different types of equipment become available to assist in the hunt, and in certain missions it is not required to kill animals ? tranquillizing them is sufficient.</desc>

There are over 500 locations across North America to fish from, and they all have different kinds of fish. You can also battle world record trophies for the largest fish, from the smallest fish to the largest. The weather is always perfect in this game and there are no hazards. The game plays like most other Cabela fishing games, and strives to be just like real life. When you begin to catch a fish, you must press a series of buttons to catch the fish. The larger the fish, the more buttons you have to press.</desc>

		<name>Call of Duty : Finest Hour</name>
		<desc>After winning 2003 PC "Game of the Year" awards from a number of magazines and online publications, the World War II-themed first-person shooter Call of Duty seeks its Finest Hour in this 2004 console version. As in the home computer original, PlayStation 2 players experience the game through three different campaigns, which have them taking the roles of an American, British, and Russian soldier in turn.
 Each campaign is designed to offer a distinct perspective, as the player's characters and their squad mates participate in historically inspired battles across four different continents. The Call of Duty series is noted for its historical accuracy and cross-cultural perspectives, its interactive environments, and its cinematically styled approach to story-telling. The PC original was developed by Infinity Ward, a team comprising several designers who had worked on the successful Medal of Honor series. The Finest Hour console versions of Call of Duty are the first games from developer Spark Unlimited.</desc>

		<desc>This version of Call of Duty: World at War is very different from its counterparts.  Aside from the graphics engine, the violence is toned down, resembling its predecessor and it features different storylines, locations and missions from the other versions.

The story is divided into four campaigns. The first takes place at the beginning of the war in the South Pacific as the player takes control of Pvt. Joe Miller serving with the American 2nd Marine Division as they start out in basic training in North Carolina. This level lets the player learn the controls of the game and then fastforwards to the Guadalcanal (as though the training mission was a flashback) where the player must survive with his company.  There are four more missions, two on the island of Betio and two on the island of Saipan.</desc>

As many real-life veterans and history buffs will recognize, the sequel's subtitle is an affectionate name for the United States Army's most decorated division, First Infantry.
 Players take the role of a soldier among its ranks. In addition to a vigorous campaign that leads them past grim landmarks of war-torn Europe and Northern Africa, players are given an opportunity for some light role-playing, as the game's story encourages them to bond with their fellow soldiers.</desc>

		<desc>After a successful run on personal computers, elusive thief Carmen Sandiego sneaks her way onto PS2 in an international adventure spanning five continents. While previous games in the educational series featured a point-and-click interface as players pieced together clues to Sandiego's whereabouts, The Secret of the Stolen Drums is a more action-oriented title.
 Cole Gannon, a rookie in the ACME detective agency finds a set of GPS coordinates on the agency's computer server, which leads him to a museum in New York. The GPS coordinates involve a case dealing with the infamous thief Carmen Sandiego, who Cole wants to capture despite being still just in training. It seems Carmen wants to put back together a set of stolen tribal drums that will unleash an unspeakable power.</desc>

 You play Leon Belmont, who was once a Baron for the King. After his betrothed, Sara, was kidnapped and taken to a large castle, Leon asked the Church for permission to command his underlings to attack the castle. Because of the Crusades going on in the East, he is denied such. But because of his love for Sara, he denounces his title and leaves, going with no weapon or clue to the castle. He is stopped by an alchemist named Rinaldo, who was once a vampire-hunter himself. He gives Leon the Whip of Alchemy, offers to help him further in his quest, and sends him on his way.</desc>

		<name>Chessmaster</name>
		<desc>The iteration of the Chessmaster series on the PlayStation 2 contains most of the features available in the corresponding PC game - which, in this case, is Chessmaster 9000. You can play training games (with all the hints and analysis tools available), rated games (your rating changes after each play), puzzles (chess ones, not the "build the picture" type), learn chess by browsing through the hundreds of tutorials available in the Pandolfini's Chess School or watch famous games.

There are, however, some new features in the PS2 version; the most useful one is the Online mode. Other is the "living world" of the Chessmaster Championships, where the AI's rating changes, too, as they play each other. The last one is more spectacular - a  fantasy-themed - orcs vs. humans - game mode with animated chess sets and a 3D environment. You get to play chess in a forest, inside a castle and in the desert.</desc>

There's over 200 different body styles to unlock through the story mode (very few of them actually change the way your ChoroQ handles or performs; they're largely for show) and a wide range of parts you can buy to upgrade your car (either for performance or for looks).

The game supports two player split screen where you can import your ChoroQs from your own individual adventures and battle each other and also compete against each other in a wide range of minigames.</desc>

Levels present to Cid both enemies and puzzles ? or, more exactly, obstacles

It features the obligatory roster updates (including the names of the players) with 325 NCAA Division I teams to choose from and improve crowd reactions, updated mascots, new fight songs and real life coaches such as Billy Donovan, Roy Williams and Jay Wright.

It has the standard modes and has an updated Legacy (franchise) mode that has the player take command of a NCAA team, recruiting and training potential NBA players for the future.  It sports updated offensive and defensive A.I. and features Team Unity where the chemistry of the team combined with the captain's leadership qualities can combine to help their team in their performance and morale on the court.

Players can also customize by creating their own school along with uniforms and even design a unique stadium for their created school.  The games are almost identical except for a few differences: the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions has the ability to create their own chants for their crowds to yell during home games and the PS3 utilizes the SIXAXIS controller to shoot free throws by tilting it.</desc>

		<name>Colosseum : Road to Freedom</name>
		<desc>Taken into slavery, you are now a gladiator. Your only chance at freedom is to earn enough money in the arena to buy yourself back. Whether in a lowly arena on the outskirts of the Empire or in the Colosseum itself, a wide variety of opponents await: heavily armed charioteers, wild bulls, fellow gladiators and more. In a series of battles, from battle royales to one-on-one duels, you must entertain the crowds by spilling blood.

After battles, it's time to train. A series of minigames improves your attributes and your diet perfects your body. Study your rankings, play around with your special skills, and await the next battle.

Colosseum: Road to Freedom is a self-described Action RPG, controlled in the third-person and works as a gladiator simulator.</desc>

		<name>Combat Elite : WWII Paratroopers</name>
		<desc>Combat?Elite: WWII Paratroopers is primarily a top-down close-combat shooter with some RPG features. It can be played in single-player or two-player coop mode. The game lets the player take part as a paratrooper in the allied campaign in Europe during the second world war, starting out as a private soldier from either the US 101st Airborne, the US 82nd Airborne, or the British 1st Airborne regiment.

There are 40 missions strung together with a narrative, depicting the Operation Overlord (D-Day), Bastogne, Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge and beyond - ending in an fictional effort to stop the Nazis from creating an atomic bomb. During a mission, you find medical packs, ammunition (weapon specific), and new weapons as pickups lying around, or dropped by enemies killed - the drops disappear if not picked up in time. A mission takes place on a series of relatively small maps, separated into 'levels', and at the level transition points the player can save the game, and is also awarded skill points, new ranks and medals.</desc>

		<desc>Conflict: Desert Storm is a first person/third person shooter, and each mode can be switched by the press of a button. You and your team are sent on missions with specific objectives, whether it be to infiltrate a base, destroy a SAM site, or assassinate an opposing general. You can both control your men individually and send them orders. Your men can be ordered to attack, retreat, follow, stay, and do many more things. If the mission requires it, you must drive tanks and jeeps around while your squad mans the guns on the vehicle. There is also the ability to play up to four player co-op with friends, with each person controlling a soldier in your squad.

At the end of each mission, if you performed well, your men are awarded medals for their bravery. If you work hard enough, you may even be able to earn the Medal of Honor.

The game features a Co-Op Campaign for 2 players.</desc>

		<desc>This installment of the Conflict series occurs in many diverse regions of the World: in Conflict: Global Terror, Red Team spends the game fighting international terrorism.

Rather than gung-ho desert tank warfare, or tense jungle ambush fighting, the game explores many non-army locations such as gas factories, cocaine production facilities and hotels.

The combat is often up close and very personal, although most levels seem to mix up the killzone areas giving a wide variety that support combat over many varying ranges. The Missions vary quite a bit too. Some are frenetic - fast paced where the team are fighting for their lives, others can be played at a much slower pace if desired. The level design really adds to counter-terrorism gameplay. The Team are often busting seiges using C4 to blow holes in walls and smoke grenades to flush the bad guys out.</desc>

		<name>Constantine</name>
		<desc>John Constantine is the name of the main character in the Hellblazer comic by Vertigo DC. This game is based on the movie Constantine, starring Keanu Reeves. The player assumes the role of Constantine, a mage/exorcist/demonslayer of the modern age. A man who fights Evil, but remains cynical and skeptical in the face of Good. He also smokes a lot.

The game is played in third person perspective, switching to first person when the hero enters narrow spaces. Constantine's goal is to discover how and why Demons have managed to physically enter Earth, although the ancient laws forbid it. He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch's Curse) that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell, which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or stretched out to allow for more action. Hidden cards in levels will unlock cutscene animatics, concept art, and interviews with the stars of the film.</desc>

		<name>Crash : Mind over Mutant</name>
		<desc>Crash: Mind over Mutant continues the storyline of its predecessor, Crash of the Titans. 

The Titans from the previous game has broken free from Dr. Cortex' control and has settled down on various places on the Wumpa Islands. But Cortex has teamed up with Nitrus Brio to develop a device which can control both the bandicoots and the Titans. Now Crash and his friends must find out where Cortex is hiding and stop him before he can act out his devious plan. 

Crash can use a light-powered attack to defeat smaller enemies, but for bigger enemies, a more high-powered attack is needed. Crash can also block and dodge attacks. Just like in Crash of the Titans, Crash can take control of the Titans which he encounters. But this time he can take the Titans with him and use them when he needs it. As Crash defeats more and more enemies, he can upgrade both his own attacks and the attacks of the Titans in his possession.

The Co-Op Experience:
Your co-op partner is Crash's sister, Coco, playable for the first time in the cooperative mode. Not only does Coco make the game more inviting to pick up and play, she also brings with her a new tactile "treasure hunt" ability where one co-op partner can "jack" on the other and ride as gunner, using different ammo.</desc>

		<name>Crash Bandicoot : The Wrath of Cortex</name>
		<desc>Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original PlayStation. The story is set some time after Warped: Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. So Crash needs to defeat Crunch (and in the end, Dr. Cortex).

The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.</desc>

The brave bounty hunter Sho, who wields a special sword which he can also use as a gun, is determined to put an end to the invasion. During his adventure he encounters a girl named Feanay, who will help him on his journey.

In this action game you control both Sho and Feanay. Some of the missions can be accessed by both characters, while some are available only to one of them. Feanay uses energy pistols and dual laser swords as weapons. Both Sho and Feanay use the so called "neo-psionics", which are the magic spells of the game. There are also slight role-playing elements in the game. Defeated enemies drop special items that can be later used to upgrade your weapons. You also gain set amounts of experience points after missions.</desc>

When they find out that Dr. Kosugi is missing, they venture into the dangerous areas of the city to bring him back and punish the culprits.

Crimson Tears is an action game with role-playing elements. Controlling either of the three protagonists (Amber, Kadie, or Tokio), each with their own strengths and weaknesses, the player explores randomly generated, enemy-infested stages, disposing of the foes in combo-based hack-and-slash combat. Experience points are gained from battle victories, allowing the characters to level up and become stronger.

Weapon components can be collected from fallen enemies and combined to make new weapons. Like the characters themselves, weapons level up, increasing in attack power and reducing the necessity to repair them. The protagonists have access to ranged attacks, blocks, and powerful area attacks. The player should also keep an eye on their temperature meter, preventing them from overheating.</desc>

When a player lands on another player's monster, he/she can challenge it to a battle in an attempt to take over the territory.

Each girl has different methods of dealing with things and different storylines, and you can select with whom to play the game through (each girl has its own disc to boot up).

Players guide lead characters Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu to uncover secrets and speculations as old as Christianity itself.
 Appropriately perhaps, the game is in the basic form of a classic mystery adventure, compete with clickable crime scenes and tricky inventory puzzles. The point-and-click pondering is punctuated with action sequences, however, in which the heroes can use stealth and surprise to take down opponents. The Da Vinci Code was developed by The Collective, known for previous license-based games such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, and Marc Ecko's Getting Up.</desc>

The object of the game is to "dance", which means that the player must hit the arrows that travel up the screen at the right time, thus scoring and unlocking more songs and burning some fat in the process.

The game features 54 songs from which 21 are licensed and the other 33 are made for the game.</desc>

Also adding to the impressive line-up of songs is new music by the famous video game musician Yuzo Koshiro, whose credits include composing music for hit games such as Streets of Rage series, Revenge of Shinobi and Shenmue.</desc>

		<desc>Slightly varied in technology and musical content from the Japanese arcade game and home port of the same name as well as the parallel European release Dancing Stage SuperNova 2, this game delivers rhythmic play that has become well-established over the course of the series' dynasty -- to gloss generally, players are rated on how effectively they deliver input in response to a continuously-scrolling list of controller direction instructions.  When the screen tells players that they're about to be called upon to hit the "left" button as its corresponding glyph ascends up the screen, they must try to match it precisely at the moment of the glyph's overlap with a target area at the top of the screen.  DDR games being what they are, this is all synchronized to player-selected electro-pop music with music video or animated dancing avatar sideshows, and of course is intended for play with the series' trademark control device, a giant four-way directional pad laid on the floor to be rhythmically walked upon.  (Two can be used simultaneously for two players or one who boasts some simply spectacular dance moves.)</desc>

		<name>Dark Angel : Vampire Apocalypse</name>
		<desc>Promising over 100 hours of gameplay, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse is one of the longest adventures on the PlayStation 2. Set in the year 1640, players assume the role of Anna, the Dark Angel of Retribution. Though he was defeated a century ago, the monsters and demons faithful to the Shadow Lord have begun preparations for his resurrection. Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across. An action-RPG that borrows elements from the likes of Diablo, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse presents players with a wide array of equipment and an arsenal of weapons -- both, projectile-based and melee-oriented -- to collect. 

Weapons are bound to the controller's four face buttons, allowing players to combine items as desired. The requisite meters allow you to monitor health, spirit, and experience levels as well as your current stash of gold. Spanning three separate races, the hordes of monsters all succumb to different weapons you have at your disposal. Broadswords for example, are particularly effective against the Undead. The storyline is purposely non-existent, with nothing in the way of cut-scenes, and minimal character interaction to reveal more of the plot. Players are free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete. You simply have to build Anna's abilities for the duration of a year, and ensure that she will be strong enough when the time comes for her to face the Shadow Lord.</desc>

		<desc>The military has mysteriously closed the summit of Mt. Garrick, and Chief O'Leary is trying desperately to drive snowboarders off the mountain.

Dark Summit is a twist on the snowboarding genre.  Instead of trying to pull off insane tricks, you'll be completing various missions, such as "Find the Bomb" and "Destroy the Cannon".  Pulling off tricks earns you points to buy new equipment.</desc>

In desperate need of a hero, Illusia calls upon one of its own to save the land from a dire threat. Players will guide this young warrior on an epic quest that will have them adventuring across a completely 3D world for the first time in the series. From majestic plains to towering mountains, the interactive environments in Dawn of Mana offer an assortment of places to visit, characters to meet, and creatures to battle. The combat system once again unfolds in real-time, with players able to jump, slash with a sword, fire projectiles, and even swing a whip that can attach itself to objects.</desc>

		<desc>Jack Slate is back, in this beat-up sequel to the first. He teams up with his K9 Dog, Shadow, to overtake the criminal underground in Grant City. The  main focus of the game is on Jack taking down crime after the kidnapping of a judge. He discovers a city full of corruption and betrayal.

Included is a 360 degree fighting system. Returning to the game is the super slow motion that was originally employed in  Max Payne games and The Matrix movie. You can now use Shadow to attack enemies in real-time while you beat down on other enemies. If his stamina bar is high enough, Slate's K9 will kill the enemy, and if he is tired, he'll work to keep any enemy away with vicious bites.

This game includes a lot of weapons including rocket launchers, grenades, and Molotov cocktails. The minigames are not essential to the game, whereas they were in the original game. However, most of the game is very similar to its predecessor.</desc>

		<name>Tekken's Nina Williams in : Death by Degrees</name>
		<desc>Nina Williams, world-renowned assassin, has been hired by the CIA and MI6 to join a team which is attempting to infiltrate "Kometa," a notorious criminal organization. The team's strategy involves gaining access to the target through a fighting tournament being held on the "Amphitrite," a luxury cruise ship owned and operated by Kometa.

The game's most remarkable feature is the ability to allow Nina to use her martial arts skills to break the bones of her enemies through use of carefully aimed attacks. These attacks do more damage to the enemy and show the player the damage being inflicted on the opponent's skeletal structure. Strangely, this does little to actually disable opponents, as they often continue to use limbs that have been literally shattered, as well as survive blows to the head that would cause the skull to practically explode, without even losing consciousness.

Once the game is completed, "Anna Mode" will be unlocked, offering the player the ability to play as Nina's younger sibling, Anna. Various outfits can be unlocked throughout the game, which include a bikini, cocktail dress, purple jumpsuit, black and silver stealth suit. Playing the game a second time causes LCD crates throughout the game to contain infinite supplies of certain weapons, such as infinite katana and infinite rail-gun. After completing the game twice, the wrestling costume as seen in the opening FMV is also unlocked. A third clear game file additionally unlocks "Tekken 2 Nina", which instead of an outfit is actually a different facial and bodily construction, exactly as she appears in the Tekken title, in low resolution.</desc>

The game opens with the person you beat in the previous game, D-Mobb, being arrested.  As the police are driving, an SUV comes out of nowhere and smashes into the car, setting D-Mobb free.  After a quick cutscene, it turns out the person who was driving the SUV was you, and you have now joined D-Mobb's crew.

Fight for NY's story mode takes you through the ranks, and pits you against tougher and tougher fighters.

		<desc>The game begins with a Furon, Cryptosporidium-136, hovering over a launch site with military personnel testing a rocket. The rocket is launched and destroys the ship carrying Cryptospiridium-136, and leaves him fatally wounded. Crypto-136 is later captured, by the U.S. Army. Some time later, Cryptosporidium-137 travels to Earth with another Furon, Orthopox. Cryptosporidium (nicknamed 'Crypto') comes with the intention of rescuing 136, while Orthropox (nicknamed 'Pox') desires to extract human brain stems for study. Crypto arrives at Turnipseed Farm in the Midwest, where Pox mistakes Cows for Earth's dominant life-form. The Majestic agency is alerted to the Furon presence when Crypto decimates an army brigade passing through the area. Pox, communicating with Crypto through a hologram-like device, then reveals to Crypto that the reason he requires human brain stems is because they contain Furon D.N.A. handed down to them by Furon scouts eons ago when the Furons stopped on Earth for "shore leave" following a war with Mars (which was rendered uninhabitable by the Furon Empires).</desc>

		<desc>The game is set in 1969, 12 years after the original. The game begins with a KGB slide show meeting showing that the main character from Destroy All Humans!, Cryptosporidium-137, is now deceased for unknown reasons. His clone, Cryptosporidium-138 (Crypto for short), made of more pure furon DNA, is now taking his place and continuing to pose as the United States President. KGB intelligence reveals that Crypto-138 is the first and only Furon to have genitalia, referred to only as "The Package". Seeing the furons as a threat to the Soviet Union, the KGB destroy the furon mothership with a nuclear missile.

Destroy All Humans! 2 has a co-op multiplayer mode, so the player can play through the story mode, free roam together and minigames, such as PK Tennis and Duel, with a friend.</desc>

Legends tell of two millennia ago, in the darkest reaches of Hell, a demon swordsman named Sparda awoke to justice and a rebelled against the devil to wage a one-man war to save the human world from damnation. Now, 2000 years later, a dark figure named Dante finds clues that the Devil is rallying to rise up again against mankind. Who was Sparda and how does Dante fit into this gothic puzzle? Deep within Dante's blood lies the power of ancient demons and the key to defeat the hordes of the dark realm. Somewhere between a man and a demon lies our only chance for salvation. If he succeeds, even the Devil May Cry.</desc>

		<name>Dirge of Cerberus : Final Fantasy VII</name>
		<desc>Set after the events of Final Fantasy VII and the Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children movie, Dirge of Cerberus lets players take the role of the mysterious Vincent Valentine.

After a new organization arises from the events known as "Meteorfall", Vincent is called to the surviving town of Kalm by Reeve Tuesti, an old ally who controlled Cait Sith. Vincent has been invited to the town's celebration, but during the festivities, a group of soldiers attacks the town, killing and capturing the people. It is up to Vincent to protect the innocent once more, and find out why these soldiers are also after him.

While set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerberus is an action shooter that runs through twelve chapters. The on-screen action can be controlled by the analog controller, or via the Playstation 2's mouse and keyboard accessories, making it more in line with PC-style shooters. Being a character driven shooter, the perspective can be changed from first to third person on the fly to navigate through the multi-level environments.

Several items and characters from the series make their return, as well as the Chaos break limits system, which allows Vincent to take the monstrous forms he changed into from Final Fantasy VII to inflict more damage on the enemy. Taking a nod from its RPG-based parent, the game does allow Vincent to find the usual healing items, materia spells and gil from the Final Fantasy universe, in which he can buy and sell for other new items.

The game also features a weapon customization system, which allows the player to mix and match weapon parts to form more powerful attack items and abilities.</desc>

		<name>Disaster Report</name>
		<desc>Keith Miyamoto is a reporter who works for an important newspaper in Los Angeles. In 2005, he travels to an island called Capital City, where he has to get a new job. However, on his way from the airport to the city, a terrible earthquake occurs. The train collapses and Keith finds himself abandoned by the rescue team. Now he has to escape the island, try to save the people stranded on it, and discover the true reasons behind the chaos in the city. But that will be anything but easy. The earthquake continues, and any time Keith steps on a half-collapsed bridge, crawls over a pile of rumble, or climbs a narrow path between ruined houses, the Earth can start trembling...

Disaster Report is a combination of pure adventure and survival horror genres. Controls, inventory management, fixed camera angles and relative vulnerability of the protagonist are reminiscent of Alone in the Dark and similar games, while the complete lack of enemies to fight reminds of a classic adventure. There are many ways to preserve Keith from constant dying. You can find items and combine them into new ones (for example, finding a helmet and a lamp will allow you to build a helmet with a flashlight attached to it). Keith will also need to quench his thirst, so you'll have to find water for him. The water taps found in the game also serve as save points.</desc>

		<desc>After a two-year sleep, Prince Laharl awakens to find his father, King Krichevskoy, dead and the Netherworld in the middle of a civil war over who takes the throne. Not willing to give up his rightful place as the next king, Laharl joins with his subordinate Etna and her underlings to fight back.

Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed.

Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.</desc>

		<name>Disgaea 2 : Cursed Memories</name>
		<desc>In order to lift the curse placed upon the inhabitants of Veldime 15 years prior, the protagonist's mother attempts to summon the evil Overilord Zenon so that her son Adell can defeat him and lift the curse. Instead his daughter, Rozalin is summoned, and Adell commits to returning her home to her father, as well as to defeating her father when they find him. 

The game is a turn-based strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics. Classes gain abilities by gaining character levels, and can level up those abilities through use. New items and equipment can be bought or won in battle, and can be powered up up by entering and winning battles inside a given item. Characters can also "gang up" on enemies by performing combos that are activated by positioning other characters near an attacking character. This action only uses the attacking character's turn, leaving the others free to attack again. Clever coordination can have characters attacking quite a few times per turn. New characters can be created (or even reborn as other classes or just more powerful versions of the same class) by petitioning (or even bribing with special items) the Dark Assembly with "Mana" you earn by defeating enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Disney High School Musical 3: Senior Year Dance! is a rhythm game based on the film High School Musical 3: Senior Year. Players can choose to be one of the characters of the film (Chad, Gabriella, Kels, Ryan, Sharpay, Taylor or Troy) or create a new, customized Wildcat. It features several environments and songs from the three films. Gameplay is presented as a series of dance-offs where small orbs floating in one of four directions need to be timed correctly when they pass a threshold to keep the dance and the song going. On the Wii the swings are measured while the Xbox 360 version supports the tracking of steps on a dance pad.

Next to the single-player mode there is a head-to-head competitive dance mode. Sometimes quick mini-games break out in the middle of songs and special effects can be activated while dancing. By learning dance moves from the characters additional songs, clothing and characters can be unlocked.</desc>

		<desc>Based off a combination of the popular Disneyland attraction and the 2003 movie of the same name, players guide Zeke Holloway through the house of 999 happy haunts in order to solve a mystery, put the spirits to rest, and get out of the house alive.

The game is presented as a 3rd person action adventure.  Players are allowed full roam of the mansion, once they collect enough Shriveled Souls inside their Beacon of Souls, a special lantern designed to collect the various lesser ghosts throughout the rooms.  Though Zeke handles his quest alone, he is aided by the help of Madame Leota, and six friendly ghosts who will provide hints and items throughout the journey.  As Zeke solves puzzles, completes various tasks, and helps rid the house of its evil spirits, these spiritual companions will provide Soul Gems, which amplify the power of the Soul Beacon.  Once fully charged, Zeke will have the ability to face the main spirit, Atticus Thorn, for the final showdown.</desc>

		<desc>Treasure Planet is the adaptation of an animated Disney movie.  The game follows the adventures of Jim Hawkins, a young boy on a quest to locate a mythical planet called Treasure Planet. To find the planet he needs to travel to many locations throughout the universe and complete tasks before he finds the ultimate prize.  The tasks range from finding a certain number of items to catching runaway animals to flipping a series of switches. Completing the tasks lights a beacon, and when a set number of these beacons are lit, the next level is then available. 

Jim is also able to ask for help from his "pet," Morph, to get him past areas that pose a challenge.  Morph can change his shape into a helpful item like giant robotic arms or a jetpack.

Another adaptation from the movie is solar surfing. During the surfing missions Jim pilots a futuristic surfboard to complete the mission objectives.</desc>

		<desc>Players control James P. "Sulley" Sullivan through 8 levels based on environments from the movie, including the scream factory, the streets of Monstropolis, Sulley's apartment, the Himalayas, and more. In each level, the main goals might include picking up one or more special items, or simply finding the exit. Sulley has to make his way across platforms, ladders and conveyor belts by jumping, climbing, flipping switches and pushing crates around. Enemies are rare, but Sulley can take them out with a whack of his tail, which is also used to break crates that contain items. There are also stealth sections, where Sulley has to avoid being seen by another character. Since the game is intended for younger players, there is no limit to the retries to any level, and helpful hints are always available.

Each level also includes a number of collectibles and special tasks. There are 100 discarded screams to pick up - finding a certain percentage of them unlocks mini-game bonus levels. There are also 5 scream canisters to find and a small challenge involving scaring 5 mice within a time limit. If both are completed, clips from the movie are unlocked.</desc>

In the year 2700, mankind has left behind millions of tiny trash collectors to make the planet habitable again. Yet only WALL-E remains functional, dutifully performing his task while collecting an odd assortment of souvenirs. His uneventful life takes on new meaning when he encounters a sleek, shiny robot named EVE, sent by humans to monitor the clean-up progress.
 Based on the 2008 computer animated film from Pixar Animation Studios, the video game version of WALL-E involves controlling the lonely robot as he navigates a trash-tainted world and begins an unlikely trek across the cosmos. Gameplay consists of using WALL-E's distinct abilities to create "cubes" used to build platforms or to create distractions. In addition to solving puzzles throughout the solo adventure, up to four players can compete in mini-games ranging from timed races through space to competitive battles.</desc>

Since his death, and in the absence of his charisma and leadership, the world has become chaotic. Yet something appears to be transpiring.

For the adventurer who returns the kingdom's wealth, his majesty offers the honor of his daughter's hand, and therefore the title of future king. This doesn't mean, however, that you aren't permitted to play as a female character. You simply receive an altered ending in this instance.

Three different modes are available: Story Mode, Normal Mode, and Shopping Race. You then create your character and begin play, the mode you choose having an affect on the overall goal to be achieved. The Story Mode is the standard play through of the plot, Normal Mode lets you generate certain factors of play ahead of time, like starting level, and go from there, etc. There are 3 started classes (warrior, chief and magician) and through levelling eventually 11 become available.

While having a board game scenario with a spinner that allows the player to move over a game board, this is very much a light role-playing game as it has basic jobs, a battle system, and upgrades. Landing on a spot can trigger a battle, advance the story or introduce a mini-game. It is a 2-player game at all times (with another character controlled by the computer), but up to 4 people can participate.</desc>
