		<name>Alien Invasion</name>
		<desc>Alien Invasion is a fixed screen shoot 'em up based on Space Invaders but with some additions to the gameplay. There are twelve different invaders in the game including one that takes two hits to kill. The invaders have three different kinds of bomb: normal bombs that drop straight down, spinning bombs that drop diagonally and homing bombs that seek out the player. A notable difference from Space Invaders is that the old shields are gone. Instead the laser base has a built in shield that can be activated for protection. The player starts out with two shields and get new ones at the start of each new wave. The UFOs acts as supply ships and will randomly drop power ups that the player can catch. Power ups include extra lives and shields, stopping the invaders from moving or dropping bombs and movable rockets. There's also a power up that makes the invaders invisible.

The game also comes with editors that allow the player to change sprites and wave formations.

Originally published by Alien Visions in 1990, it was re-released in 1994 by Archimedes World.</desc>

		<desc>Let's get ready to Ruuuummmmblllle!!!



Designed and programmed by Mark Dixon from Arc systems and Alien Images, All in Boxing is a fighting game that just can't be beat! Boasting a heaving hitting roaster of 6 fighters from the unstoppable 'Willie Win', 'Ed Strong', 'Hans Full', 'B.A. Sher', 'N.O. Kowt', and the USSR brute 'Ivor Hardpunch' the fun never stops! 



Once you choose your combatant it is time to train. So take to the bags, Mac, we've got work to do! But unlike your jaw you can't afford to slack-off because you only got twenty seconds before you have to make the entrance to the big match!



AND Here it is the moment we've all been waiting for, the fight of a life time that can be over as quickly as you count 7-8-9...

DING-DING DING.



In each round you are given the chance to train some more.  This gives you a boost depending how hard you work. These mini-games break up the monotony. From jumping rope to punching bags. It's just a matter of time before you pin him to the corner. 



So the question is... Do you have what it takes? Do you have the eye of the tiger?</desc>

		<name>Elite</name>
		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

		<name>Bubble Fair</name>
		<desc>Bubble Fair is a variant of the arcade game Pang. The story involves the characters Inky and Jinky who arrive at a fair as soap bubbles start falling from the sky. The bubbles are the work of the sorcerer ARCphile who wants to control all stalls of the fair. To make him stop, Inky and Jinky challenge him to a duel. The duel involves a game of noughts and crosses where each stall represents a square. In each of the stalls the player has to catch the ice cream that is hidden within a bubble that blocks access to the stall. For each stall there are two ice creams to catch and when done that square is won. To win the whole game the player has to win the nought and crosses game four times.

Like in the arcade game, it is a platform game with single screen levels. Bubbles will bounce around and the player's task is to destroy them with the use of an upwards travelling rope attached balloon that when hitting a bubble splits it into smaller ones or destroys it completely. The game features power ups that are dropped when a bubble is hit. These can lead to both positive and negative effects including increased or decreased time or score, giving a shield, extra balloons or inverting the player's movement. In total there are 72 levels.</desc>

		<name>Bug Hunter In Space</name>
		<desc>Bug Hunter in Space is a sequel to the original Bug Hunter game. Once again the player controls the Hysteron Proteron which this time is sent to deal with a fleet of alien space crafts. Each craft consists of a number of levels in which the player has to kill all the aliens before entering a teleport to move to the next one. If the craft is flying it is also necessary to shut down its engines and on the last level of each craft the player has to trigger the craft's reactor and escape before it blows up.

The game plays largely the same as its predecessor but it features larger scrolling levels. The Hysteron Proteron has no weapons (except for some that can be picked up at certain locations) but can walk on walls and ceilings and pick up certain objects. These objects have to be dropped on the aliens to kill them. Additionally it's possible to jump and activate devices but only when not carrying an object. The player has three lives and one is lost upon making contact with an alien.</desc>

		<name>Cannon Fodder</name>
		<desc>Guide a team of up to six soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<desc>Guide a team of up to six soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<name>Conqueror</name>
		<desc>In Conqueror, you are in command of one or more tanks on a battlefield against a set of computer-controlled opponents. Each battle level gives you greater numbers and more powerful tanks against increasingly menacing opponents with up to fifteen tanks on each side.
In each game you can choose between either having American and British, German or Russian forces, against one of the other two. Each Power has four types of tank - one light, two medium and one heavy - all based on geniune Second World War machines.
Conqueror is played in real time on a three-dimensional scrolling landscape with trees, houses and rivers (similar to Zarch).

Arcade game:
The first game consists of a series of battles with your group of tanks against the computer-driven ones. The first combination at level zero is an Amencan Chaffee - fast and light - against a Panzer III which is less powerful.

Attrition game:
You have a standard set of tanks - two light, two medium and a heavy - but the computer starts off with an inferior selection. In each successive battle, the computer's selection becomes more and more potent.

Strategy game:
In this you can choose the tanks you require from a fixed budget, and the computer does likewise. When you win a battle the budget increases. Within this game there are other options such as use of spotter planes and artillery fire which can be bought at the cost of some tank power.

At all levels you can choose between manual or automatic tank strategy, In the former you control where the tanks on your side go; in the latter this is controlled by the computer but you can override it.
Tactical control is via the map, you select a tank and click the position you want it to move to.</desc>

Suddenly, there are attempts on his life, with the words 'insider dealings' floating around. The hero is framed for a crime he didn't commit, and must prove his innocence before it is too late.

The game is a text adventure with graphics; the player inputs verb commands to interact with the environment and advance the story. The gameplay focuses on realistic investigation and information-gathering rather than puzzle-solving.</desc>

		<desc>EGO: Repton 4 should not be confused with the Repton 4 that was included in Repton Infinity. Gameplay wise it is quite different from previous releases in the Repton series. Although focus is still on puzzle solving the player controls Repton (or Ego as he is called here) from a top down perspective and the goal of each level is to collect puzzle pieces that have to be assembled into a picture of a famous person, building, painting etc. The player can only pick up one piece at a time and has to carry it to a frame in the middle of the level where it has to be placed at the right place. It's important to collect the pieces in the right order or else an empty place in the middle might be blocked by surrounding pieces. A piece can only be dropped at the right place and it is not possible to move pieces that have already been placed. The player also has to collect gems that are found all around the levels. The picture can not be completed unless all gems have been collected. Different obstacles exist too. Towers and trees might block the path and there are also holes to fall down into and androids to avoid. There are also transporters and conveyors that are needed to reach certain parts of the levels.</desc>

		<name>Elite</name>
		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

		<name>Flashback : The Quest for Identity</name>
		<desc>Flashback (aka Flashback: The Quest for Identity) incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving.

While a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground.

To defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information and compete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas.</desc>

		<desc>The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.</desc>

Iron Lord is a strategy game with action and light adventure elements, set in the Middle Ages and featuring hand-drawn graphics. After returning from journeys far away, you find your ancestral castle in ruins, and hear rumors that a huge army is marching towards your land. Your only hope is to raise an army and fight back, but after your long absence you are an unknown heir to the land. To raise the army you need to win the respect of the people, by traveling through your land and accomplishing tasks, win competitions, and finally gather enough men to fight the army.</desc>

		<desc>Ported to the Archimedes by James Byrne of Cygnus Software.

Iron Lord is a strategy game with action and light adventure elements, set in the Middle Ages and featuring hand-drawn graphics. After returning from journeys far away, you find your ancestral castle in ruins, and hear rumors that a huge army is marching towards your land. Your only hope is to raise an army and fight back, but after your long absence you are an unknown heir to the land. To raise the army you need to win the respect of the people, by traveling through your land and accomplishing tasks, win competitions, and finally gather enough men to fight the army.</desc>

		<name>Jet Fighter</name>
		<desc>Jet Fighter is a variant of Jetpac that is largely the same as the original game but features a larger play area and different types of enemies. The player controls an astronaut that first has to collect all three parts of his rocket and then fully fuel it so that it can take off. The rocket parts are located on various platforms that the astronaut has to use his jetpack to reach. After the rocket has been fully assembled fuel will start falling from the sky and once enough of it has been collected the rocket will automatically ascend.

The game is entirely played with the mouse, using one button to thrust upwards and the other to shoot at the strange beings that fly around. Any contact with these will lead to a lost life and the game ends on the third. There is also a time limit for each level. By shooting the beings points are earned and bonuses are earned by collecting falling objects.</desc>

		<desc>Leeds United Champions! is a managerial soccer simulation in which the player takes control of Leeds United, the English champions of the 1991/92 season, in the fourth division; the goal being to conquer the Premier League in the long run. The game is completely menu based and the sub-menus are reached through a list of icons in the main menu. In those menus the player can set all the usual options of the genre, e.g. training, transfer market, lineup, ticket prices, youth section or stadium expansion. There is no match presentation to speak of; just a screen representing a live ticker which gives out the goals and bookings. Each athlete has 15 stats which influence his performance on the field.</desc>

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>

		<desc>Professor Mariarti is, as the game title suggests, a mad scientist. Not all of his experiments worked out the way they should and now he needs to shut down the power in five of his labs (the first four can be tackled in any order). This plays out as a standard platformer: Mariarti jumps over gaps between platforms and dodges enemies (he can take a few hits before dying) until he reaches the end of the level, i.e. the off switch.

At the start of the game he only throw wrenches to defend himself, but during the game he finds coins scattered around the labs. Those can be used to buy more advanced weapons like a laser cannon. However, killed enemies respawn after a short time. To proceed he also needs to solve a few puzzles by collecting items and bringing them to the correct place. There are also a number of switch puzzles.</desc>

As opposed to its predecessor, Super Fulcrum takes place in one big scenario instead of single missions. Your task is to represent the Soviet Union in a UN force sent to South America to defend a small country that is being threatened by a bigger and stronger neighbour. The game is relatively open-ended, allowing you to fulfill your missions in the way you see fit instead of monitoring your every step. All missions and their results are handled in your pilot's log.</desc>

		<desc>Moonquake is a A Bomberman clone written in 1992 for Acorn RISC OS computers. There are one and two player modes. The single player mode requires you to clear all the blockages over ten levels – each level includes more rambling robots and various reactors. Reactors can only be hit a limited number of times before exploding and wiping out the whole level, yourself included. The two player mode is a straightforward battle to the death.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Doo</name>
		<desc>Mr Doo is a variant of the arcade game Mr. Do! which makes some changes to the original design. The player controls a wizard who has to collect cherries and avoid various monsters. Unlike the arcade game the monsters do not chase the player but move in straight lines and only change direction upon reaching a block. The monsters can be killed by throwing a bouncing magic ball or by making apples fall onto them. The magic balls does not recharge in the version but instead the player starts out with five of them. Other differences include that the apples can not be pushed and that there are no letter monsters. There are some special tiles that add puzzle solving elements to the game. There are electric cables which kill the player on contact, bombs that detonate when triggered and sliders which push the wizard across the screen. The game can be customized and it is possible to turn off both the special tiles as well as the monsters and apples. There is also an option to play levels in normal, random or reversed order. In total the game contains 60 levels and a built-in editor can be used to modify them or to create new ones.</desc>

		<name>Nebulus</name>
		<desc>Nebulus (aka Tower Toppler) was ported to the Archimedes by Krisalis.

You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.
You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.
The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.
Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<desc>A fleet of space freighters carry a cargo of battle and security robots to help in the defence of Basmyth. Alien ships were bombarding the freighters with disorienting beams which drove the robots crazy. The human officers were eliminated, leaving the ships open for occupation by alien forces. At this point the players mission starts...

You control a cybernetic influence device (ID) which has been teleported aboard the first freighter to eliminate all the droids and robots. Two ways are possible to clean the ship decks representing the action part and the more strategy part of the game: Shooting (action) to destroy the robots or connecting itself into an other robot's brain (strategy) and take temporarily control of it.

It's possible to play the game as a simple shoot-em-up game, but the main part of Paradroid 90 is the transfer game to take control of other droids.</desc>

		<name>Pipemania</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

The game can be played using keyboard and/or analogue joystick. In 2 player mode joystick can only be selected by player 1.</desc>

		<desc>Poizone is a Pengo variant with an ecological theme. The player controls the penguin Zozo as he attempts to decontaminate each of the game's 50 levels. Like in Pengo each level contains blocks that can be pushed or destroyed. It differs though in that the main objective is not to kill the enemies but to destroy a number of toxic blocks. To complete a level 90% of these blocks have to be destroyed and it has to happen before time runs out.

There are eight kinds of toxic blocks and each has its own way to be destroyed. For example some blocks has to be destroyed from a specific direction while some has to be pushed away. Destroying a toxic block in the wrong way leads to a lost life. A life is also lost when making contact with a monster. Some other blocks exist such as power pills that can be used to avoid monsters and diamonds that give bonuses.</desc>

		<desc>Repton 3, released 5 November 1986, was developed by Matthew Atkinson at Superior's invitation since Tim Tyler wasn't interested in programming it—although he did design some of the levels for the new game. While the first two games had only taken a month each to program, Repton 3 took eight months.[1] It reverts to the form of a series of time-limited, password-protected levels. A few new features were introduced: fungus (a substance that gradually spreads wherever it finds space and kills Repton on contact), time capsules (resetting the current level's time limit each time one is collected), crowns and a timebomb which must be defused to complete each level. The inclusion of the timebomb means that, as well as collecting all of the diamonds and crowns, the user has to plan their route so as to finish up at the timebomb at the end of the level.</desc>

		<desc>SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new municipality, with the responsibility of building and maintaining a place where citizens can move to and work and be happy. The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.
Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, ...</desc>

		<name>Simon The Sorcerer</name>
		<desc>Simon is just an ordinary boy living in modern-day England. One day, his dog Chippy discovers a chest with a book inside, entitled Ye Olde Spellbooke. Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.

Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue.

Like in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</desc>

		<name>Simon The Sorcerer</name>
		<desc>Simon is just an ordinary boy living in modern-day England. One day, his dog Chippy discovers a chest with a book inside, entitled Ye Olde Spellbooke. Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.

Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue.

Like in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</desc>

		<name>Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.

You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.

The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.

You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.

A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.</desc>

		<desc>StarFighter 3000 is a space combat simulation featuring air-to-air and air-to-ground combat with over 50 varied missions spread across 4 levels.
There are enemy fighters, heat seeking missiles and space cruisers to deal with, not to mention enemy SAM sites and radar installations.
The laser can be used to destroy defences by targeting the ground they are on.
By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.
The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game is over, but the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.</desc>

		<name>Starch</name>
		<desc>Players play as two manual workers, Harry and Dave, on a frantic clothes-cleaning night shift. In addition to the two main characters the game also includes a computer controlled character called Sam that attempts to stop the progress of the main characters.
There are five different levels to complete, each consisting of a specific task. In order to complete a task the player has to work out how to operate various pieces of machinery controlled by buttons, levers and ropes.
Each level ends when the available time expires or a specific quota is met. Following the completion of each level the two characters are shown in the manager's office. If the level has been successfully completed then they jump up in the air in celebration. If the level has not been completed then the manager pulls a lever that opens a trap door, while uttering the words "you're fired!"

The game supports either one or two simultaneous players. In one player mode the second character is controlled by the computer.</desc>

Each robot's name indicates what their main function and purpose is, and these skills must be combined for success. Each section has its own task - collecting energy pods and destroying mines and bombs for example. The creatures which fill the towers must be avoided, or used to your advantage.

The game is viewed through a rotating camera with variable zoom, giving the game an advanced 3D feel for the day. A level designer has also been included.</desc>

		<name>Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition</name>
		<desc>A home computer version of the board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

Two game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

The question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art &amp; Literature, Science &amp; Nature, Geography, History, Sports &amp; Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music.

One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</desc>

		<desc>After the Cariken family became complacent, the land of Gaspar ceased to be ruled as well. This left the way clear for evil men such as Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. Only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces.

As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.

		<name>Warlocks</name>
		<desc>A platform shoot-em-up featuring a reincarnated knight who was tasked with freeing the world of Lylvania from the tyranny of 3 demented Warlocks.  The game set over ten large levels. The early levels are reasonably linear, but they soon become larger, requiring much exploration. Hidden rooms and caves can be found, containing extra lives, magical power-ups and level warps. Other features of this game are smooth parallax scrolling, thunder and lightning, rain, animating backdrops, stunning 256 colour graphics and great sound effects and music.

This game has been reviewed in:

Acorn Computing, Christmas Special December 1993 (with coverdisc demo)
Archimedes World, January 1994
Acorn User, February 1994
Acorn Action, Spring 1994

The game requires 1Mb of ram and RiscOS 2 or higher, but as it uses some minor video trickery, it will not work properly on VIDC2 machines without a software VIDC patch. It is compatible with the standard Acorn joysticks.

To enter the first hidden room, on level one after the second drop, walk left as far as you can and through the wall. This room continues past the water-fall, where you must stand on a chest and jump into the wall next to it to gain access to the third hidden part. When climbing the ladder out of the hidden room, walk into the far archway to be transported to the next level.

Many other hidden rooms are spread throughout the levels.

The levels are:

1 - The Forest
2 - The Graveyard
3 - The Waterfall
4 - The First Encounter
5 - The Giant Forest
6 - The Caves
7 - Skull Island
8 - The Volcano
9 - The Second Encounter
10 - The Castle</desc>

		<desc>In World Championship Boxing Manager the player can develop the careers of aspiring heavyweight boxers. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing the manager's office.

Training the boxers involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.</desc>

		<name>Zool - Ninja of the “Nth” Dimension</name>
		<desc>Zool (aka Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension) is a platform game ported to the Acorn Archimedes by James Byrne of Cygnus Software.

His name is Zool, and he is a gremlin-like creature from another dimension. He is forced to land on the Earth, but his sole goal is to attain the prestigious ranking of a Ninja. To do that, Zool will have to travel through six worlds, each divided into three stages, defeat his enemies, and prove himself worthy of that title.
Zool is a fast-paced side-scrolling platformer. The protagonist can run, jump, climb walls, and shoot enemies. Power-ups for Zool are scattered across the levels. These include life-spending hearts, smart bombs, shields, more powerful jump-skill and a twin Zool. This "twin" imitates the original's motions a few seconds after he performs them.

Zool was notable for the use of commercial product placement throughout the game's levels.</desc>

		<desc>Ballarena is a Breakout variant and as such the player's objective is to clear out all the blocks (which here come in many different shapes) on the screen with the use of a paddle that bounces a ball. What makes it different from other games of its kind is that the paddle is not only moved along the bottom of the screen but in a circle around the blocks located in the middle. There are no borders that stop the ball so it can leave the playing field on any side of the screen. When it has done so four times it is game over for the player. Clearing all blocks from the screen leads to progression to the next stage. Like in Arkanoid it's possible to pick up various power ups. These including giving bonus points, catching the ball with the paddle and a laser that can be used to blast blocks. The game also features various monsters that move around the screen and deflect the ball. They can be killed by hitting them with the paddle. Every fourth stage is a challenge stage where the game turns into a shoot 'em up similar to Gyruss. Monsters appear in the middle of the screen and the player uses his paddle to shoot them down as quickly as possible. The player then earns points based on number of shots and hits. The game can be played by one or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<name>Cascade</name>
		<desc>The water supply has been polluted by various nasty chemical compounds which have been placed there by evil aliens from Zygon 3 !! The only hope is to use the purification factories to remove the chemicals and make the water clean again. The aliens were not able to destroy these compounds but they have made accessing them hard by building huge structures over them and placing complicated puzzles inside these structures (the aliens have a very strange sense of humour and seem to find this funny). You must control a robot which can withstand the chemicals to a certain extent and direct the water to the exit pipe; from here it will flow into the purification plant and will be cleaned. You must do this within a certain time or the corrosive chemicals in the water will destroy your robot. When a level has been purified you will be able to move onto the next. You must purify all eight zones and there are five different structures in each zone.</desc>

		<desc>Sir Freddy is a sneaky and mean man who lives in a castle on an island. He turned green with envy when you built a better and stronger castle across the sea. He got a fleet of balloons so that he didn't get wet and then planned to bomb your castle with ease. What a cad to think of this wheeze! You in turn employed a gun crew to build a battlement with a good view to shoot down Sir Freddy in his balloon. To match your defensive intent, Sir Freddy phoned the Ship Shop and hired several Gun ships to shoot your cannon crew. You must defend your castle and shoot down the balloons and the invading ships.</desc>

		<desc>Thundermonk is an action puzzle game where the player controls The Lonesome Monk whose monastery has been overtaken by evil demons. The aim of the game is to move through the labyrinths of the monastery, collect treasures and use golden keys to unlock the Doors of Destiny. On each floor three goblets need to be collected. The monk is controlled from a side view which looks similar to a platform game but there is no jumping since the monk can levitate through the air. The monastery is full of strange objects that zaps the monk's energy when touched but these can be destroyed by throwing bombs. These bombs can be thrown through walls and at specific places it is also possible to walk through walls. Energy also decreases automatically with time and when throwing bombs which means the player can't take too long since a life is lost when energy runs out.</desc>

		<name>Zool - Ninja of the “Nth” Dimension</name>
		<desc>Zool (aka Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension) is a platform game ported to the Acorn Archimedes by James Byrne of Cygnus Software.

His name is Zool, and he is a gremlin-like creature from another dimension. He is forced to land on the Earth, but his sole goal is to attain the prestigious ranking of a Ninja. To do that, Zool will have to travel through six worlds, each divided into three stages, defeat his enemies, and prove himself worthy of that title.
Zool is a fast-paced side-scrolling platformer. The protagonist can run, jump, climb walls, and shoot enemies. Power-ups for Zool are scattered across the levels. These include life-spending hearts, smart bombs, shields, more powerful jump-skill and a twin Zool. This "twin" imitates the original's motions a few seconds after he performs them.

Zool was notable for the use of commercial product placement throughout the game's levels.</desc>

The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models. To escape the mansion, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place. Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons. Weapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.</desc>

		<desc>Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models. To escape the mansion, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place. Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons. Weapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.</desc>

		<name>Ballarena</name>
		<desc>Ballarena is a Breakout variant and as such the player's objective is to clear out all the blocks (which here come in many different shapes) on the screen with the use of a paddle that bounces a ball. What makes it different from other games of its kind is that the paddle is not only moved along the bottom of the screen but in a circle around the blocks located in the middle. There are no borders that stop the ball so it can leave the playing field on any side of the screen. When it has done so four times it is game over for the player. Clearing all blocks from the screen leads to progression to the next stage. Like in Arkanoid it's possible to pick up various power ups. These including giving bonus points, catching the ball with the paddle and a laser that can be used to blast blocks. The game also features various monsters that move around the screen and deflect the ball. They can be killed by hitting them with the paddle. Every fourth stage is a challenge stage where the game turns into a shoot 'em up similar to Gyruss. Monsters appear in the middle of the screen and the player uses his paddle to shoot them down as quickly as possible. The player then earns points based on number of shots and hits. The game can be played by one or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<name>Bubble Fair</name>
		<desc>Bubble Fair is a variant of the arcade game Pang. The story involves the characters Inky and Jinky who arrive at a fair as soap bubbles start falling from the sky. The bubbles are the work of the sorcerer ARCphile who wants to control all stalls of the fair. To make him stop, Inky and Jinky challenge him to a duel. The duel involves a game of noughts and crosses where each stall represents a square. In each of the stalls the player has to catch the ice cream that is hidden within a bubble that blocks access to the stall. For each stall there are two ice creams to catch and when done that square is won. To win the whole game the player has to win the nought and crosses game four times.

Like in the arcade game, it is a platform game with single screen levels. Bubbles will bounce around and the player's task is to destroy them with the use of an upwards travelling rope attached balloon that when hitting a bubble splits it into smaller ones or destroys it completely. The game features power ups that are dropped when a bubble is hit. These can lead to both positive and negative effects including increased or decreased time or score, giving a shield, extra balloons or inverting the player's movement. In total there are 72 levels.</desc>

		<name>Bug Hunter and Moon Dash</name>
		<desc>Bug Hunter / Moon Dash is a collection of two games on one disk, both previously unreleased.

In Bug Hunter the player takes control of Hysteron Proteron, a being that was designed by bio engineers to be a strong, intelligent and loyal super soldier able to take out entire armies. Things didn't go right however. After a DNA mixup they instead ended up with a tiny spineless and two legged creature hardly capable of harming any creature. So rather than having it fighting on the battlefields it was decided that it should instead be used for insect extermination. The game is a puzzle platformer. Hysteon Proteron has sucker feet that allows it to walk on walls and ceilings but lacks any weapons. Instead it has to pick up objects that it has to drop onto the insects. If it comes into contact with the insects the player loses one of three lives. Once all insects are dead the player leaves the level and moves on to the next.

Moon Dash takes place in the year 4244 where human colonists have been in war with the alien race known as the Judhs for many years. The player is transporting a PR 64 planet ranger to the capital when numerous alien ships appear above him. The objective of the game is to drive the PR 64 through 16 zones until reaching the city. The game is side scrolling and the player drives his vehicle on the ground while alien space ships try to crash into him from above. While trying to avoid being hit the player can use his turret to shoot back at the aliens. At the same time he has to jump over various obstacles on the ground.</desc>

		<name>Bug Hunter In Space</name>
		<desc>Bug Hunter in Space is a sequel to the original Bug Hunter game. Once again the player controls the Hysteron Proteron which this time is sent to deal with a fleet of alien space crafts. Each craft consists of a number of levels in which the player has to kill all the aliens before entering a teleport to move to the next one. If the craft is flying it is also necessary to shut down its engines and on the last level of each craft the player has to trigger the craft's reactor and escape before it blows up.

The game plays largely the same as its predecessor but it features larger scrolling levels. The Hysteron Proteron has no weapons (except for some that can be picked up at certain locations) but can walk on walls and ceilings and pick up certain objects. These objects have to be dropped on the aliens to kill them. Additionally it's possible to jump and activate devices but only when not carrying an object. The player has three lives and one is lost upon making contact with an alien.</desc>

		<desc>Guide a team of up to six soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<name>Cannon Fodder</name>
		<desc>Guide a team of up to six soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<desc>The water supply has been polluted by various nasty chemical compounds which have been placed there by evil aliens from Zygon 3 !! The only hope is to use the purification factories to remove the chemicals and make the water clean again. The aliens were not able to destroy these compounds but they have made accessing them hard by building huge structures over them and placing complicated puzzles inside these structures (the aliens have a very strange sense of humour and seem to find this funny). You must control a robot which can withstand the chemicals to a certain extent and direct the water to the exit pipe; from here it will flow into the purification plant and will be cleaned. You must do this within a certain time or the corrosive chemicals in the water will destroy your robot. When a level has been purified you will be able to move onto the next. You must purify all eight zones and there are five different structures in each zone.</desc>

The playing area is very large with 15 screens each of which is made up of an area approximately 16 times the size of the monitor. The aim of the game is to penetrate deep into enemy territory and destroy its nerve centre. First you must deactivate the safety devices which are in distant parts of the caves. Along the way you will find ropes to help you pick up items and pipes for re-fueling.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Heimdall, a demi-god based in Norse mythology. Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three lands: the land of men (Midgard), the land of giants (Utgard) and the land of the gods (Asgard). You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these lands to collect the god's weapons. Each land has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms. When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.</desc>

		<desc>The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.</desc>

		<name>Hoverbod</name>
		<desc>Hoverbod is an action puzzle game where the player controls a yellow spherical droid who has to retrieve some stolen treasure from the bad guy Barriuss Stearneruss. The game is played from a side view perspective and initially the player is limited to rolling the sphere left and right. However by picking up a collectable the ability to hover in the air is granted. There are two different hover collectables which decide how high the sphere can move vertically. Another collectable is the missile which allows the sphere to shoot monsters and blast through blocks. Some missile collectables only make it possible to shoot in one direction and a second one has to be collected to be able to shoot both left and right. The monsters are called Ibbles and Squibbles and will kill the sphere on contact. Other dangers include spikes but these can be reversed by picking up the right collectable. Oxygen is limited and a level has to be completed before it runs out although more can be collected. The game contains eight levels where the objective is to collect all diamonds. Upon the completion of one a password is given which allows the player to start on the next one. After all eight levels have been completed the game moves on to a final level called the Castle of Gribb. The objective there is to collect 500 feathers that are needed to build two giant wings used to fly home. In the castle there is a new enemy type, the Gribbles, who grow and multiply uncontrollably.</desc>

Three different ball speeds, variable match lengths and an 'easy' mode are on offer. Different tournament types are on offer, at 'club' and 'tournament' levels, with a customisable ladder system of multiple divisions to rise up.

		<desc>Jet Fighter is a variant of Jetpac that is largely the same as the original game but features a larger play area and different types of enemies. The player controls an astronaut that first has to collect all three parts of his rocket and then fully fuel it so that it can take off. The rocket parts are located on various platforms that the astronaut has to use his jetpack to reach. After the rocket has been fully assembled fuel will start falling from the sky and once enough of it has been collected the rocket will automatically ascend.

The game is entirely played with the mouse, using one button to thrust upwards and the other to shoot at the strange beings that fly around. Any contact with these will lead to a lost life and the game ends on the third. There is also a time limit for each level. By shooting the beings points are earned and bonuses are earned by collecting falling objects.</desc>

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings.

Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>

		<desc>Professor Mariarti is, as the game title suggests, a mad scientist. Not all of his experiments worked out the way they should and now he needs to shut down the power in five of his labs (the first four can be tackled in any order). This plays out as a standard platformer: Mariarti jumps over gaps between platforms and dodges enemies (he can take a few hits before dying) until he reaches the end of the level, i.e. the off switch.

At the start of the game he only throw wrenches to defend himself, but during the game he finds coins scattered around the labs. Those can be used to buy more advanced weapons like a laser cannon. However, killed enemies respawn after a short time. To proceed he also needs to solve a few puzzles by collecting items and bringing them to the correct place. There are also a number of switch puzzles.</desc>

The player can cause more damage to these enemies by charging their shots before firing. The player's weapon also changes its shape and features according to the requirements of each world. The Bitmap Kid has special athletic abilities. He can jump high by stepping on whirlwinds and can even destroy all the creatures he hits after falling down from a high place. In addition, he also can ride a bike, dive and even fly thanks to the special items he encounters on the way.</desc>

		<name>Minotaur</name>
		<desc>Minotaur is a maze game played from a first person perspective. It is based on the Greek myth where King Minos sent a group of young Athenians to be fed by the Minotaur in the Labyrinth of Crete. The player's task is to enter the labyrinth, save as many men as possible and then escape before getting killed. The player has to reach the men before the minotaur or else they will die. The labyrinth is randomly generated at start up and it's possible for the player to enter its size. While moving around the labyrinth the player will come across various items that can be picked up. Most common are the food cans and the bottles which are necessary to avoid thirst or starvation. There are also compasses and pieces of a map that make it easier to find a way through the labyrinth. To be able to kill the minotaur, the player first has to find a sword and will then kill it automatically upon contact. If not in possession of a sword the player can press the spacebar to quickly run away from the minotaur. It will however cause all collected items to disappear.</desc>

		<name>Nebulus</name>
		<desc>Nebulus (aka Tower Toppler) was ported to the Archimedes by Krisalis.

You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.
You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.
The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.
Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

		<name>Orion</name>
		<desc>Orion is a side scrolling shooter similar to Defender. Marauding aliens are attacking the player's home planet and it's his task to defend it and it's civilians. This is done by controlling a space craft left and right over the planet surface while blasting away at the various enemy forces that both try to take down the player and abduct the people standing on the ground. If an alien catches a human and drags it to the top of the screen it will mutate and become a dangerous enemy. Humans that fall from a shot down enemy can be saved by flying into them and then carried back to the surface. If all civilians die the planet will explode but the action will continue in deep space against a swarm of mutated aliens. In addition to the regular fire the player also has access to a limited supply of smart bombs that kill all aliens on the screen. There's also a hyperspace button that allow the player to quickly travel to another part of the stage but using it too much might lead to death.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Bitstream/Pipe Mania (United Kingdom) (F1028101).jfd</path>
		<name>Pipemania</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

The game can be played using keyboard and/or analogue joystick. In 2 player mode joystick can only be selected by player 1.</desc>

		<desc>Poizone is a Pengo variant with an ecological theme. The player controls the penguin Zozo as he attempts to decontaminate each of the game's 50 levels. Like in Pengo each level contains blocks that can be pushed or destroyed. It differs though in that the main objective is not to kill the enemies but to destroy a number of toxic blocks. To complete a level 90% of these blocks have to be destroyed and it has to happen before time runs out.

There are eight kinds of toxic blocks and each has its own way to be destroyed. For example some blocks has to be destroyed from a specific direction while some has to be pushed away. Destroying a toxic block in the wrong way leads to a lost life. A life is also lost when making contact with a monster. Some other blocks exist such as power pills that can be used to avoid monsters and diamonds that give bonuses.</desc>

Each of the 80-plus levels is a top-down view of an arrangement of locks and dials, which must be aligned so as to unlock each section by having identical colors touching each other. Not all locks can be moved however, and all of this must be done within a time-limit. Your time to collect the gold (by opening each of the 9 doors in sequence in the hope of finding lots of bling) is limited by how long you took to crack the code. There is a bonus game to unlock, as well as extra lives and special power-ups. A password system ensures that a level need only be cleared once.</desc>

		<desc>A game of strategy and reflex directly adapted from the arcade to the Archimedes. You have to assemble the forms and colours to solve the various contracts. On completion of the 64 levels you reach the I.L.G. (Infinite Level Generator). Different coloured shapes appear at the top of your screen and drop down to the bottom and your job is to arrange them in various ways according to the contract you are given. In phase one you have to arrange spheres into vertical rows of three of the same colour - and you have to perform the feat four times to fulfil the contract. Phase two is similar, except that you have to arrange things horizontally in groups of three of the same colour - and do it five times. Phase three involves blocks of four shapes and diagonal lines of three, and so on with the phases getting harder. Other things also turn up at random on the screen. Most useful is the bonus which entitles you to move on to the next phase without completing your contract. There are also nasties which take points off your score and reverse the effect of your movement keys for a while.</desc>

		<name>Thundermonk</name>
		<desc>Thundermonk is an action puzzle game where the player controls The Lonesome Monk whose monastery has been overtaken by evil demons. The aim of the game is to move through the labyrinths of the monastery, collect treasures and use golden keys to unlock the Doors of Destiny. On each floor three goblets need to be collected. The monk is controlled from a side view which looks similar to a platform game but there is no jumping since the monk can levitate through the air. The monastery is full of strange objects that zaps the monk's energy when touched but these can be destroyed by throwing bombs. These bombs can be thrown through walls and at specific places it is also possible to walk through walls. Energy also decreases automatically with time and when throwing bombs which means the player can't take too long since a life is lost when energy runs out.</desc>

		<name>Alien Invasion</name>
		<desc>Alien Invasion is a fixed screen shoot 'em up based on Space Invaders but with some additions to the gameplay. There are twelve different invaders in the game including one that takes two hits to kill. The invaders have three different kinds of bomb: normal bombs that drop straight down, spinning bombs that drop diagonally and homing bombs that seek out the player. A notable difference from Space Invaders is that the old shields are gone. Instead the laser base has a built in shield that can be activated for protection. The player starts out with two shields and get new ones at the start of each new wave. The UFOs acts as supply ships and will randomly drop power ups that the player can catch. Power ups include extra lives and shields, stopping the invaders from moving or dropping bombs and movable rockets. There's also a power up that makes the invaders invisible.

The game also comes with editors that allow the player to change sprites and wave formations.

Originally published by Alien Visions in 1990, it was re-released in 1994 by Archimedes World.</desc>

		<name>All-In Boxing</name>
		<desc>Let's get ready to Ruuuummmmblllle!!!



Designed and programmed by Mark Dixon from Arc systems and Alien Images, All in Boxing is a fighting game that just can't be beat! Boasting a heaving hitting roaster of 6 fighters from the unstoppable 'Willie Win', 'Ed Strong', 'Hans Full', 'B.A. Sher', 'N.O. Kowt', and the USSR brute 'Ivor Hardpunch' the fun never stops! 



Once you choose your combatant it is time to train. So take to the bags, Mac, we've got work to do! But unlike your jaw you can't afford to slack-off because you only got twenty seconds before you have to make the entrance to the big match!



AND Here it is the moment we've all been waiting for, the fight of a life time that can be over as quickly as you count 7-8-9...

DING-DING DING.



In each round you are given the chance to train some more.  This gives you a boost depending how hard you work. These mini-games break up the monotony. From jumping rope to punching bags. It's just a matter of time before you pin him to the corner. 



So the question is... Do you have what it takes? Do you have the eye of the tiger?</desc>

The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models. To escape the mansion, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place. Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons. Weapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.</desc>

		<desc>Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models. To escape the mansion, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place. Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons. Weapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.</desc>

		<desc>A futuristic 3D space shooter.

You are tasked with destroying a race known as the Rakonans. They have taken over a number of planets and it is your job to destroy the Rakonan colonies on these planets to an extent that they cannot survive and the planet is then 'sterlised'. It can then be re-colonised by the original inhabitants.

Upon starting the game your craft descends to the planet surface and the battle begins. There are plenty of things to destroy, mainly on the ground, but from time to time you will come under attack from flying saucers and other things in the sky. You are initially based on the ground, but it is possible take off and fly your craft around in the air. However your craft's energy is drained much quicker when flying so to recharge the energy levels you need to return to ground level and stay still for a while.

Your craft is protected by shields and they can take a number of hits before they are finally destroyed. Shields can be recharged by moving your craft away from enemy fire. Once the shields have been destroyed one single enemy shot will finish you off.

As you progress around the landscape you will encounter buildings and objects, all of which can be destroyed. However some don't need to be, for example there are small houses which can be flattened but these are harmless so you don't really need to worry about them too much. You should pay more attention to the other objects that fire back at you - these need to disposed of as soon as you see them.

When you have destroyed enough objects on the planet to sterilise it the mission will end. You will then be presented before the Royal Guild of Spacing who will assess your performance. You will also end up here when your game ends. There are nine planets to sterilise and at the start of the game only one is available so you have to complete each of the planets in order to gain access to the next one.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Games/Archimedes Elite (Europe).adf</path>
		<name>Elite</name>
		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

		<name>Ballarena</name>
		<desc>Ballarena is a Breakout variant and as such the player's objective is to clear out all the blocks (which here come in many different shapes) on the screen with the use of a paddle that bounces a ball. What makes it different from other games of its kind is that the paddle is not only moved along the bottom of the screen but in a circle around the blocks located in the middle. There are no borders that stop the ball so it can leave the playing field on any side of the screen. When it has done so four times it is game over for the player. Clearing all blocks from the screen leads to progression to the next stage. Like in Arkanoid it's possible to pick up various power ups. These including giving bonus points, catching the ball with the paddle and a laser that can be used to blast blocks. The game also features various monsters that move around the screen and deflect the ball. They can be killed by hitting them with the paddle. Every fourth stage is a challenge stage where the game turns into a shoot 'em up similar to Gyruss. Monsters appear in the middle of the screen and the player uses his paddle to shoot them down as quickly as possible. The player then earns points based on number of shots and hits. The game can be played by one or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<name>Break 147</name>
		<desc>A Snooker and Pool simulator game.

Break 147 is a snooker simulation. Upon loading you can choose which type of game you want. Demo mode in which 2 computer players will play against each other, Practice mode which is self explanatory, Match mode is a proper competitive match against the computer and finally in the tournament mode you play a different player in each round. The aim is to try and beat them all and get to the final and become the overall winner. With the single match mode and tournament mode, any of the opposition can be replaced by human opponents instead of the computer, so you can have up to 16 different people playing in the tournament if you so wish.

Superpool is basically the same as Break 147 but instead of a game of snooker you play pool. The game set up is the same with Demo mode , Single match, and the Tournament mode, as with Break 147 the official rules of the game are followed, and it is played on the same table as before just with a different set of balls. The sound effects, the style of gameplay and everything else is the same.</desc>

		<name>Bubble Fair</name>
		<desc>Bubble Fair is a variant of the arcade game Pang. The story involves the characters Inky and Jinky who arrive at a fair as soap bubbles start falling from the sky. The bubbles are the work of the sorcerer ARCphile who wants to control all stalls of the fair. To make him stop, Inky and Jinky challenge him to a duel. The duel involves a game of noughts and crosses where each stall represents a square. In each of the stalls the player has to catch the ice cream that is hidden within a bubble that blocks access to the stall. For each stall there are two ice creams to catch and when done that square is won. To win the whole game the player has to win the nought and crosses game four times.

Like in the arcade game, it is a platform game with single screen levels. Bubbles will bounce around and the player's task is to destroy them with the use of an upwards travelling rope attached balloon that when hitting a bubble splits it into smaller ones or destroys it completely. The game features power ups that are dropped when a bubble is hit. These can lead to both positive and negative effects including increased or decreased time or score, giving a shield, extra balloons or inverting the player's movement. In total there are 72 levels.</desc>

		<name>Bug Hunter and Moon Dash</name>
		<desc>Bug Hunter / Moon Dash is a collection of two games on one disk, both previously unreleased.

In Bug Hunter the player takes control of Hysteron Proteron, a being that was designed by bio engineers to be a strong, intelligent and loyal super soldier able to take out entire armies. Things didn't go right however. After a DNA mixup they instead ended up with a tiny spineless and two legged creature hardly capable of harming any creature. So rather than having it fighting on the battlefields it was decided that it should instead be used for insect extermination. The game is a puzzle platformer. Hysteon Proteron has sucker feet that allows it to walk on walls and ceilings but lacks any weapons. Instead it has to pick up objects that it has to drop onto the insects. If it comes into contact with the insects the player loses one of three lives. Once all insects are dead the player leaves the level and moves on to the next.

Moon Dash takes place in the year 4244 where human colonists have been in war with the alien race known as the Judhs for many years. The player is transporting a PR 64 planet ranger to the capital when numerous alien ships appear above him. The objective of the game is to drive the PR 64 through 16 zones until reaching the city. The game is side scrolling and the player drives his vehicle on the ground while alien space ships try to crash into him from above. While trying to avoid being hit the player can use his turret to shoot back at the aliens. At the same time he has to jump over various obstacles on the ground.</desc>

		<name>Bug Hunter In Space</name>
		<desc>Bug Hunter in Space is a sequel to the original Bug Hunter game. Once again the player controls the Hysteron Proteron which this time is sent to deal with a fleet of alien space crafts. Each craft consists of a number of levels in which the player has to kill all the aliens before entering a teleport to move to the next one. If the craft is flying it is also necessary to shut down its engines and on the last level of each craft the player has to trigger the craft's reactor and escape before it blows up.

The game plays largely the same as its predecessor but it features larger scrolling levels. The Hysteron Proteron has no weapons (except for some that can be picked up at certain locations) but can walk on walls and ceilings and pick up certain objects. These objects have to be dropped on the aliens to kill them. Additionally it's possible to jump and activate devices but only when not carrying an object. The player has three lives and one is lost upon making contact with an alien.</desc>

		<desc>The water supply has been polluted by various nasty chemical compounds which have been placed there by evil aliens from Zygon 3 !! The only hope is to use the purification factories to remove the chemicals and make the water clean again. The aliens were not able to destroy these compounds but they have made accessing them hard by building huge structures over them and placing complicated puzzles inside these structures (the aliens have a very strange sense of humour and seem to find this funny). You must control a robot which can withstand the chemicals to a certain extent and direct the water to the exit pipe; from here it will flow into the purification plant and will be cleaned. You must do this within a certain time or the corrosive chemicals in the water will destroy your robot. When a level has been purified you will be able to move onto the next. You must purify all eight zones and there are five different structures in each zone.</desc>

		<desc>The object of the game is to guide the water from the top of the screen into the collecting vessel at the bottom of the screen, you do this by guiding the water down the screen using blocks, pressure valves and filters.
Monsters appear as the levels progress. Some of these are harmless and generally get in the way but others are nasty and can kill you on contact. Another breed of monster will also fire at you, luckily you have your gun so you can zap them.
On later levels it's not just water that comes out of the pipes, but acid as well. This is dealt with in the same way but you must avoid contact with it. Other features which will appear throughout the game include remote control doors, dissolving blocks, and drip valves to name but a few.</desc>

A high degree of flying skill and accurate shooting are needed, together with patience and dedication if this game is to be completed. The playing area is very large with 15 screens each of which is made up of an area approximately 16 times the size of the monitor. The aim of the game is to penetrate deep into enemy territory and destroy its nerve centre. First you must deactivate the safety devices which are in distant parts of the caves. Along the way you will find ropes to help you pick up items and pipes for re-fueling.</desc>

		<desc>Chocks Away is a flight simulation game for the Acorn Archimedes. It was written by Andrew Hutchings and published by The Fourth Dimension. The game is loosely set in the First World War, though many elements are simplified and anachronistic. The player flies a single British Tiger Moth aircraft (despite the design dating from peacetime and being a trainer) on various missions against German forces. Free movement is allowed around each mission's map, though the aircraft does not have the fuel capacity to allow infinite roaming - instead it must return to the home airfield to refuel. The Tiger Moth carries a single fixed forward-firing machine gun with infinite ammunition. The player pilots the plane from an in-cockpit view, though a chase camera is used if they are shot down, showing the helpless demise of their aircraft.</desc>

		<desc>Chuck Rock's wife, Ophelia Rock, is kidnapped by the village wierdo, Gary Gritter. Chuck is rather upset about this and you have to help him make things right.
The game is a side-scrolling platformer. Chuck fights a variety of dinosaurs using his belly-buster attack and a jump kick. Occasionally he has to pick up and throw rocks to defeat enemies and allow him to jump to greater heights.</desc>

		<name>Conqueror</name>
		<desc>In Conqueror, you are in command of one or more tanks on a battlefield against a set of computer-controlled opponents. Each battle level gives you greater numbers and more powerful tanks against increasingly menacing opponents with up to fifteen tanks on each side.
In each game you can choose between either having American and British, German or Russian forces, against one of the other two. Each Power has four types of tank - one light, two medium and one heavy - all based on geniune Second World War machines.
Conqueror is played in real time on a three-dimensional scrolling landscape with trees, houses and rivers (similar to Zarch).

Arcade game:
The first game consists of a series of battles with your group of tanks against the computer-driven ones. The first combination at level zero is an Amencan Chaffee - fast and light - against a Panzer III which is less powerful.

Attrition game:
You have a standard set of tanks - two light, two medium and a heavy - but the computer starts off with an inferior selection. In each successive battle, the computer's selection becomes more and more potent.

Strategy game:
In this you can choose the tanks you require from a fixed budget, and the computer does likewise. When you win a battle the budget increases. Within this game there are other options such as use of spotter planes and artillery fire which can be bought at the cost of some tank power.

At all levels you can choose between manual or automatic tank strategy, In the former you control where the tanks on your side go; in the latter this is controlled by the computer but you can override it.
Tactical control is via the map, you select a tank and click the position you want it to move to.</desc>

Suddenly, there are attempts on his life, with the words 'insider dealings' floating around. The hero is framed for a crime he didn't commit, and must prove his innocence before it is too late.

The game is a text adventure with graphics; the player inputs verb commands to interact with the environment and advance the story. The gameplay focuses on realistic investigation and information-gathering rather than puzzle-solving.</desc>

The goal of the game is to drive as far as possible before time runs out. The game has five stages that differ in difficulty and length, from six to eighteen miles. Each stage has its own time limit. The tracks can be played separately or in one session. The stages are then unlocked by beating the time limit in the previous race. The roads are full of objects and most of them (rocks, trees and bushes) have to be avoided as crashes and collisions slow down the player. Exceptions are warning triangles which are worth points and suicidal boys who the player gets extra time for killing.</desc>

		<name>EGO: Repton 4</name>
		<desc>EGO: Repton 4 should not be confused with the Repton 4 that was included in Repton Infinity. Gameplay wise it is quite different from previous releases in the Repton series. Although focus is still on puzzle solving the player controls Repton (or Ego as he is called here) from a top down perspective and the goal of each level is to collect puzzle pieces that have to be assembled into a picture of a famous person, building, painting etc. The player can only pick up one piece at a time and has to carry it to a frame in the middle of the level where it has to be placed at the right place. It's important to collect the pieces in the right order or else an empty place in the middle might be blocked by surrounding pieces. A piece can only be dropped at the right place and it is not possible to move pieces that have already been placed. The player also has to collect gems that are found all around the levels. The picture can not be completed unless all gems have been collected. Different obstacles exist too. Towers and trees might block the path and there are also holes to fall down into and androids to avoid. There are also transporters and conveyors that are needed to reach certain parts of the levels.</desc>

		<name>Elite</name>
		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

		<name>Flashback : The Quest for Identity</name>
		<desc>Flashback (aka Flashback: The Quest for Identity) incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving.

While a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground.

To defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information and compete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas.</desc>

He got a fleet of balloons so that he didn't get wet and then planned to bomb your castle with ease. What a cad to think of this wheeze! You in turn employed a gun crew to build a battlement with a good view to shoot down Sir Freddy in his balloon. To match your defensive intent, Sir Freddy phoned the Ship Shop and hired several Gun ships to shoot your cannon crew.

Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three lands: the land of men (Midgard), the land of giants (Utgard) and the land of the gods (Asgard). You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these lands to collect the god's weapons. Each land has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms. When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.</desc>

		<desc>The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.</desc>

		<name>Hoverbod</name>
		<desc>Hoverbod is an action puzzle game where the player controls a yellow spherical droid who has to retrieve some stolen treasure from the bad guy Barriuss Stearneruss. The game is played from a side view perspective and initially the player is limited to rolling the sphere left and right. However by picking up a collectable the ability to hover in the air is granted. There are two different hover collectables which decide how high the sphere can move vertically. Another collectable is the missile which allows the sphere to shoot monsters and blast through blocks. Some missile collectables only make it possible to shoot in one direction and a second one has to be collected to be able to shoot both left and right. The monsters are called Ibbles and Squibbles and will kill the sphere on contact. Other dangers include spikes but these can be reversed by picking up the right collectable. Oxygen is limited and a level has to be completed before it runs out although more can be collected. The game contains eight levels where the objective is to collect all diamonds. Upon the completion of one a password is given which allows the player to start on the next one. After all eight levels have been completed the game moves on to a final level called the Castle of Gribb. The objective there is to collect 500 feathers that are needed to build two giant wings used to fly home. In the castle there is a new enemy type, the Gribbles, who grow and multiply uncontrollably.</desc>

Iron Lord is a strategy game with action and light adventure elements, set in the Middle Ages and featuring hand-drawn graphics. After returning from journeys far away, you find your ancestral castle in ruins, and hear rumors that a huge army is marching towards your land. Your only hope is to raise an army and fight back, but after your long absence you are an unknown heir to the land. To raise the army you need to win the respect of the people, by traveling through your land and accomplishing tasks, win competitions, and finally gather enough men to fight the army.</desc>

		<desc>Squash simulations are something of a rarity, and it was this niché that Krisalis aimed one of their many sports simulations into. The rules of squash are accurately recreated, with a realistic court layout (viewed isometrically) and a need to hit legal shots. Three different ball speeds, variable match lengths and an 'easy' mode are on offer. Different tournament types are on offer, at 'club' and 'tournament' levels, with a customisable ladder system of multiple divisions to rise up. There is a full roster of opponents to play in one-off or tournament modes.</desc>

		<name>Jet Fighter</name>
		<desc>Jet Fighter is a variant of Jetpac that is largely the same as the original game but features a larger play area and different types of enemies. The player controls an astronaut that first has to collect all three parts of his rocket and then fully fuel it so that it can take off. The rocket parts are located on various platforms that the astronaut has to use his jetpack to reach. After the rocket has been fully assembled fuel will start falling from the sky and once enough of it has been collected the rocket will automatically ascend.

The game is entirely played with the mouse, using one button to thrust upwards and the other to shoot at the strange beings that fly around. Any contact with these will lead to a lost life and the game ends on the third. There is also a time limit for each level. By shooting the beings points are earned and bonuses are earned by collecting falling objects.</desc>

		<desc>Leeds United Champions! is a managerial soccer simulation in which the player takes control of Leeds United, the English champions of the 1991/92 season, in the fourth division; the goal being to conquer the Premier League in the long run. The game is completely menu based and the sub-menus are reached through a list of icons in the main menu. In those menus the player can set all the usual options of the genre, e.g. training, transfer market, lineup, ticket prices, youth section or stadium expansion. There is no match presentation to speak of; just a screen representing a live ticker which gives out the goals and bookings. Each athlete has 15 stats which influence his performance on the field.</desc>

		<name>Lotus Turbo Challenge 2</name>
		<desc>This sequel to Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is again a behind-the-car viewed racing game. It takes place in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups. You are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint. Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track. You have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word 'Esprit' from the title. The Lotus Esprit from the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip. You can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player. On Amiga and ST the game allows you to link two machines, each of which can have two human players. If one player successfully completes one of the 8 courses, all players can continue onto the next one.</desc>

		<desc>Professor Mariarti is, as the game title suggests, a mad scientist. Not all of his experiments worked out the way they should and now he needs to shut down the power in five of his labs (the first four can be tackled in any order). This plays out as a standard platformer: Mariarti jumps over gaps between platforms and dodges enemies (he can take a few hits before dying) until he reaches the end of the level, i.e. the off switch.

At the start of the game he only throw wrenches to defend himself, but during the game he finds coins scattered around the labs. Those can be used to buy more advanced weapons like a laser cannon. However, killed enemies respawn after a short time. To proceed he also needs to solve a few puzzles by collecting items and bringing them to the correct place. There are also a number of switch puzzles.</desc>

The player can cause more damage to these enemies by charging their shots before firing. The player's weapon also changes its shape and features according to the requirements of each world. The Bitmap Kid has special athletic abilities. He can jump high by stepping on whirlwinds and can even destroy all the creatures he hits after falling down from a high place. In addition, he also can ride a bike, dive and even fly thanks to the special items he encounters on the way.</desc>

As opposed to its predecessor, Super Fulcrum takes place in one big scenario instead of single missions. Your task is to represent the Soviet Union in a UN force sent to South America to defend a small country that is being threatened by a bigger and stronger neighbour. The game is relatively open-ended, allowing you to fulfill your missions in the way you see fit instead of monitoring your every step. All missions and their results are handled in your pilot's log.</desc>

		<name>Minotaur</name>
		<desc>Minotaur is a maze game played from a first person perspective. It is based on the Greek myth where King Minos sent a group of young Athenians to be fed by the Minotaur in the Labyrinth of Crete. The player's task is to enter the labyrinth, save as many men as possible and then escape before getting killed. The player has to reach the men before the minotaur or else they will die. The labyrinth is randomly generated at start up and it's possible for the player to enter its size. While moving around the labyrinth the player will come across various items that can be picked up. Most common are the food cans and the bottles which are necessary to avoid thirst or starvation. There are also compasses and pieces of a map that make it easier to find a way through the labyrinth. To be able to kill the minotaur, the player first has to find a sword and will then kill it automatically upon contact. If not in possession of a sword the player can press the spacebar to quickly run away from the minotaur. It will however cause all collected items to disappear.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Doo</name>
		<desc>Mr Doo is a variant of the arcade game Mr. Do! which makes some changes to the original design. The player controls a wizard who has to collect cherries and avoid various monsters. Unlike the arcade game the monsters do not chase the player but move in straight lines and only change direction upon reaching a block. The monsters can be killed by throwing a bouncing magic ball or by making apples fall onto them. The magic balls does not recharge in the version but instead the player starts out with five of them. Other differences include that the apples can not be pushed and that there are no letter monsters. There are some special tiles that add puzzle solving elements to the game. There are electric cables which kill the player on contact, bombs that detonate when triggered and sliders which push the wizard across the screen. The game can be customized and it is possible to turn off both the special tiles as well as the monsters and apples. There is also an option to play levels in normal, random or reversed order. In total the game contains 60 levels and a built-in editor can be used to modify them or to create new ones.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Games/Nebulus (United Kingdom).jfd</path>
		<name>Nebulus</name>
		<desc>Nebulus (aka Tower Toppler) was ported to the Archimedes by Krisalis.

You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.
You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.
The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.
Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

		<desc>Orion is a side scrolling shooter similar to Defender. Marauding aliens are attacking the player's home planet and it's his task to defend it and it's civilians. This is done by controlling a space craft left and right over the planet surface while blasting away at the various enemy forces that both try to take down the player and abduct the people standing on the ground. If an alien catches a human and drags it to the top of the screen it will mutate and become a dangerous enemy. Humans that fall from a shot down enemy can be saved by flying into them and then carried back to the surface. If all civilians die the planet will explode but the action will continue in deep space against a swarm of mutated aliens. In addition to the regular fire the player also has access to a limited supply of smart bombs that kill all aliens on the screen. There's also a hyperspace button that allow the player to quickly travel to another part of the stage but using it too much might lead to death.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<name>Paradroid 2000</name>
		<desc>A fleet of space freighters carry a cargo of battle and security robots to help in the defence of Basmyth. Alien ships were bombarding the freighters with disorienting beams which drove the robots crazy. The human officers were eliminated, leaving the ships open for occupation by alien forces. At this point the players mission starts...

You control a cybernetic influence device (ID) which has been teleported aboard the first freighter to eliminate all the droids and robots. Two ways are possible to clean the ship decks representing the action part and the more strategy part of the game: Shooting (action) to destroy the robots or connecting itself into an other robot's brain (strategy) and take temporarily control of it.

It's possible to play the game as a simple shoot-em-up game, but the main part of Paradroid 90 is the transfer game to take control of other droids.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Games/Pipe Mania (United Kingdom).jfd</path>
		<name>Pipemania</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

The game can be played using keyboard and/or analogue joystick. In 2 player mode joystick can only be selected by player 1.</desc>

		<desc>Poizone is a Pengo variant with an ecological theme. The player controls the penguin Zozo as he attempts to decontaminate each of the game's 50 levels. Like in Pengo each level contains blocks that can be pushed or destroyed. It differs though in that the main objective is not to kill the enemies but to destroy a number of toxic blocks. To complete a level 90% of these blocks have to be destroyed and it has to happen before time runs out.

There are eight kinds of toxic blocks and each has its own way to be destroyed. For example some blocks has to be destroyed from a specific direction while some has to be pushed away. Destroying a toxic block in the wrong way leads to a lost life. A life is also lost when making contact with a monster. Some other blocks exist such as power pills that can be used to avoid monsters and diamonds that give bonuses.</desc>

Your mission set by the solarian chief council, is to regain control over all eight worlds. To recapture a world you have to destroy it's surface, machinery and organic structures. The seventh colony has manufactured various small fighter crafts to hinder your mission and destroy your ship by firing small homing bombs at you. Your ship, the Redshift 15A, is equipped with triple laser banks, anti-matter turbo drive, holomap terrain scanner and solaray energy inductors. But be aware that the laser banks, turbo drive and terrain scanner may fail at low energy levels.</desc>

		<name>The Life of Repton</name>
		<desc>Repton 3, released 5 November 1986, was developed by Matthew Atkinson at Superior's invitation since Tim Tyler wasn't interested in programming it—although he did design some of the levels for the new game. While the first two games had only taken a month each to program, Repton 3 took eight months.[1] It reverts to the form of a series of time-limited, password-protected levels. A few new features were introduced: fungus (a substance that gradually spreads wherever it finds space and kills Repton on contact), time capsules (resetting the current level's time limit each time one is collected), crowns and a timebomb which must be defused to complete each level. The inclusion of the timebomb means that, as well as collecting all of the diamonds and crowns, the user has to plan their route so as to finish up at the timebomb at the end of the level.</desc>

		<name>Revelation!</name>
		<desc>Revelation is an abstract puzzle game based around cracking codes on safes. Each of the 80-plus levels is a top-down view of an arrangement of locks and dials, which must be aligned so as to unlock each section by having identical colors touching each other. Not all locks can be moved however, and all of this must be done within a time-limit. Your time to collect the gold (by opening each of the 9 doors in sequence in the hope of finding lots of bling) is limited by how long you took to crack the code. There is a bonus game to unlock, as well as extra lives and special power-ups. A password system ensures that a level need only be cleared once.</desc>

		<desc>Rockfall is a Boulder Dash variant. It is not related to the Atari ST series with the same name more than being inspired by the same game. Like in the original game the objective is to collect a certain number of gems in each of the game's levels. At the same time falling boulders have to be avoided since being hit by one leads to a loss of life. There are also some creatures moving around the caves that the player can kill by letting boulders or gems fall on them. Some of them will then be turned into gems. There are also bombs that can be collected and used to kill the creatures. Once enough gems have been collected an exit will open that the player can escape through. This all has to be done before the timer reaches zero.</desc>

		<desc>S.W.I.V. is a vertical scrolling shooter and an unofficial follow-up to Sales Curve's conversion of the side scroller Tecmo arcade game Silkworm.

One player controls a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles pass over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also includes a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.

Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

		<name>Simon The Sorcerer</name>
		<desc>Simon is just an ordinary boy living in modern-day England. One day, his dog Chippy discovers a chest with a book inside, entitled Ye Olde Spellbooke. Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.

Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue.

Like in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</desc>

		<name>Simon The Sorcerer</name>
		<desc>Simon is just an ordinary boy living in modern-day England. One day, his dog Chippy discovers a chest with a book inside, entitled Ye Olde Spellbooke. Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.

Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue.

Like in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</desc>

		<desc>StarFighter 3000 is a space combat simulation featuring air-to-air and air-to-ground combat with over 50 varied missions spread across 4 levels.
There are enemy fighters, heat seeking missiles and space cruisers to deal with, not to mention enemy SAM sites and radar installations.
The laser can be used to destroy defences by targeting the ground they are on.
By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.
The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game is over, but the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.</desc>

		<name>Starch</name>
		<desc>Players play as two manual workers, Harry and Dave, on a frantic clothes-cleaning night shift. In addition to the two main characters the game also includes a computer controlled character called Sam that attempts to stop the progress of the main characters.
There are five different levels to complete, each consisting of a specific task. In order to complete a task the player has to work out how to operate various pieces of machinery controlled by buttons, levers and ropes.
Each level ends when the available time expires or a specific quota is met. Following the completion of each level the two characters are shown in the manager's office. If the level has been successfully completed then they jump up in the air in celebration. If the level has not been completed then the manager pulls a lever that opens a trap door, while uttering the words "you're fired!"

The game supports either one or two simultaneous players. In one player mode the second character is controlled by the computer.</desc>

		<name>Tactic</name>
		<desc>A game of strategy and reflex directly adapted from the arcade to the Archimedes. You have to assemble the forms and colours to solve the various contracts. On completion of the 64 levels you reach the I.L.G. (Infinite Level Generator). Different coloured shapes appear at the top of your screen and drop down to the bottom and your job is to arrange them in various ways according to the contract you are given. In phase one you have to arrange spheres into vertical rows of three of the same colour - and you have to perform the feat four times to fulfil the contract. Phase two is similar, except that you have to arrange things horizontally in groups of three of the same colour - and do it five times. Phase three involves blocks of four shapes and diagonal lines of three, and so on with the phases getting harder. Other things also turn up at random on the screen. Most useful is the bonus which entitles you to move on to the next phase without completing your contract. There are also nasties which take points off your score and reverse the effect of your movement keys for a while.</desc>

		<desc>Thundermonk is an action puzzle game where the player controls The Lonesome Monk whose monastery has been overtaken by evil demons. The aim of the game is to move through the labyrinths of the monastery, collect treasures and use golden keys to unlock the Doors of Destiny. On each floor three goblets need to be collected. The monk is controlled from a side view which looks similar to a platform game but there is no jumping since the monk can levitate through the air. The monastery is full of strange objects that zaps the monk's energy when touched but these can be destroyed by throwing bombs. These bombs can be thrown through walls and at specific places it is also possible to walk through walls. Energy also decreases automatically with time and when throwing bombs which means the player can't take too long since a life is lost when energy runs out.</desc>

Each robot's name indicates what their main function and purpose is, and these skills must be combined for success. Each section has its own task - collecting energy pods and destroying mines and bombs for example. The creatures which fill the towers must be avoided, or used to your advantage.

The game is viewed through a rotating camera with variable zoom, giving the game an advanced 3D feel for the day. A level designer has also been included.</desc>

		<name>Trivial Pursuit : The Computer Game, Genus Edition</name>
		<desc>A home computer version of the board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

Two game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

The question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art &amp; Literature, Science &amp; Nature, Geography, History, Sports &amp; Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music.

One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</desc>

This left the way clear for evil men such as Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. Only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces.

As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.

		<name>Warlocks</name>
		<desc>A platform shoot-em-up featuring a reincarnated knight who was tasked with freeing the world of Lylvania from the tyranny of 3 demented Warlocks.  The game set over ten large levels. The early levels are reasonably linear, but they soon become larger, requiring much exploration. Hidden rooms and caves can be found, containing extra lives, magical power-ups and level warps. Other features of this game are smooth parallax scrolling, thunder and lightning, rain, animating backdrops, stunning 256 colour graphics and great sound effects and music.

This game has been reviewed in:

Acorn Computing, Christmas Special December 1993 (with coverdisc demo)
Archimedes World, January 1994
Acorn User, February 1994
Acorn Action, Spring 1994

The game requires 1Mb of ram and RiscOS 2 or higher, but as it uses some minor video trickery, it will not work properly on VIDC2 machines without a software VIDC patch. It is compatible with the standard Acorn joysticks.

To enter the first hidden room, on level one after the second drop, walk left as far as you can and through the wall. This room continues past the water-fall, where you must stand on a chest and jump into the wall next to it to gain access to the third hidden part. When climbing the ladder out of the hidden room, walk into the far archway to be transported to the next level.

Many other hidden rooms are spread throughout the levels.

The levels are:

1 - The Forest
2 - The Graveyard
3 - The Waterfall
4 - The First Encounter
5 - The Giant Forest
6 - The Caves
7 - Skull Island
8 - The Volcano
9 - The Second Encounter

The ultimate aim is to do this without using the jump level option. In order to complete a level you must collect all of the treasure and then find the key to the exit before the time runs out. On your way to the exit you have to collect keys to open other doors. There are also many other items to discover such as potions, time pills, shields, extra ammo and swords to name but a few. Some of these items are useful and will help you in your quest others may not be so useful. There are also plenty of traps and enemies. Enemies include ghosts, spectres, guards and trolls. There are four characters in the game. They are Kaldor the Leprechaun, Moriana the Warrior, Cheysul the Titan and Mandrake the Enchanter, each of these characters have their own strengths and weaknesses plus special powers. You can switch between characters during the game so that you can use that particular characters special strengths to solve a particular puzzle, such as climbing over a log or cutting down vines. If any of the characters energy level reaches zero then the game is over.</desc>

		<name>The WIMP Game</name>
		<desc>The wimp game is a brilliant pointer driven graphic adventure celebrating over 10 years of Acorn Home Computers

This was one of the early RISC OS games and was the first commercial game that operated just in the desktop.

The game takes place in a house and your objective is to move through each room solving the puzzles within to gain access to the next room. The overall objective of the game is to become the owner of the best Acorn computer available, which at the time that this game was written was an R200 workstation.
You start off as an Acorn Atom owner and along the way to your R200 workstation, you become the owner of an Electron, BBC Micro, BBC Master and A3000. There are no Risc PC's here, so it gives you an idea of how old the game is. You can click the mouse menu button over the main game screen at anytime during the game and highlight the 'Status' option to show you which Acorn machine you currently own.

Control of the game is by the mouse, which involves pointing and clicking on items and artifacts in the room. Some of these are needed to complete the room, and others are simply red herrings. You can also kill yourself by touching (clicking) things that would normally harm you in the real world.</desc>

		<desc>Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter and sequel to Castle Wolfenstein.

There are six episodes and each episode has nine levels (eight regular and one final boss), plus a secret level activated by a hidden switch somewhere in the first eight levels. Regular levels often have the appearance of a maze or large areas with many enemies where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do this, he must kill the enemies and, depending on the level, activate "push walls" and / or obtain silver and gold keys to open certain doors.</desc>

		<name>World Championship Boxing Manager</name>
		<desc>In World Championship Boxing Manager the player can develop the careers of aspiring heavyweight boxers. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing the manager's office.

Training the boxers involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.</desc>

		<name>Zool : Ninja of the “Nth” Dimension</name>
		<desc>Zool (aka Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension) is a platform game ported to the Acorn Archimedes by James Byrne of Cygnus Software.

His name is Zool, and he is a gremlin-like creature from another dimension. He is forced to land on the Earth, but his sole goal is to attain the prestigious ranking of a Ninja. To do that, Zool will have to travel through six worlds, each divided into three stages, defeat his enemies, and prove himself worthy of that title.
Zool is a fast-paced side-scrolling platformer. The protagonist can run, jump, climb walls, and shoot enemies. Power-ups for Zool are scattered across the levels. These include life-spending hearts, smart bombs, shields, more powerful jump-skill and a twin Zool. This "twin" imitates the original's motions a few seconds after he performs them.

Zool was notable for the use of commercial product placement throughout the game's levels.</desc>

		<desc>Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models. To escape the mansion, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place. Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons. Weapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.</desc>

		<name>Ballarena</name>
		<desc>Ballarena is a Breakout variant and as such the player's objective is to clear out all the blocks (which here come in many different shapes) on the screen with the use of a paddle that bounces a ball. What makes it different from other games of its kind is that the paddle is not only moved along the bottom of the screen but in a circle around the blocks located in the middle. There are no borders that stop the ball so it can leave the playing field on any side of the screen. When it has done so four times it is game over for the player. Clearing all blocks from the screen leads to progression to the next stage. Like in Arkanoid it's possible to pick up various power ups. These including giving bonus points, catching the ball with the paddle and a laser that can be used to blast blocks. The game also features various monsters that move around the screen and deflect the ball. They can be killed by hitting them with the paddle. Every fourth stage is a challenge stage where the game turns into a shoot 'em up similar to Gyruss. Monsters appear in the middle of the screen and the player uses his paddle to shoot them down as quickly as possible. The player then earns points based on number of shots and hits. The game can be played by one or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<desc>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels.</desc>

		<name>Bubble Fair</name>
		<desc>Bubble Fair is a variant of the arcade game Pang. The story involves the characters Inky and Jinky who arrive at a fair as soap bubbles start falling from the sky. The bubbles are the work of the sorcerer ARCphile who wants to control all stalls of the fair. To make him stop, Inky and Jinky challenge him to a duel. The duel involves a game of noughts and crosses where each stall represents a square. In each of the stalls the player has to catch the ice cream that is hidden within a bubble that blocks access to the stall. For each stall there are two ice creams to catch and when done that square is won. To win the whole game the player has to win the nought and crosses game four times.

Like in the arcade game, it is a platform game with single screen levels. Bubbles will bounce around and the player's task is to destroy them with the use of an upwards travelling rope attached balloon that when hitting a bubble splits it into smaller ones or destroys it completely. The game features power ups that are dropped when a bubble is hit. These can lead to both positive and negative effects including increased or decreased time or score, giving a shield, extra balloons or inverting the player's movement. In total there are 72 levels.</desc>

		<name>Bug Hunter In Space</name>
		<desc>Bug Hunter in Space is a sequel to the original Bug Hunter game. Once again the player controls the Hysteron Proteron which this time is sent to deal with a fleet of alien space crafts. Each craft consists of a number of levels in which the player has to kill all the aliens before entering a teleport to move to the next one. If the craft is flying it is also necessary to shut down its engines and on the last level of each craft the player has to trigger the craft's reactor and escape before it blows up.

The game plays largely the same as its predecessor but it features larger scrolling levels. The Hysteron Proteron has no weapons (except for some that can be picked up at certain locations) but can walk on walls and ceilings and pick up certain objects. These objects have to be dropped on the aliens to kill them. Additionally it's possible to jump and activate devices but only when not carrying an object. The player has three lives and one is lost upon making contact with an alien.</desc>

		<name>Cannon Fodder</name>
		<desc>Guide a team of up to six soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

The only hope is to use the purification factories to remove the chemicals and make the water clean again. The aliens were not able to destroy these compounds but they have made accessing them hard by building huge structures over them and placing complicated puzzles inside these structures (the aliens have a very strange sense of humour and seem to find this funny). You must control a robot which can withstand the chemicals to a certain extent and direct the water to the exit pipe; from here it will flow into the purification plant and will be cleaned. You must do this within a certain time or the corrosive chemicals in the water will destroy your robot. When a level has been purified you will be able to move onto the next. You must purify all eight zones and there are five different structures in each zone.</desc>

		<desc>Sir Freddy is a sneaky and mean man who lives in a castle on an island. He turned green with envy when you built a better and stronger castle across the sea. He got a fleet of balloons so that he didn't get wet and then planned to bomb your castle with ease. What a cad to think of this wheeze! You in turn employed a gun crew to build a battlement with a good view to shoot down Sir Freddy in his balloon. To match your defensive intent, Sir Freddy phoned the Ship Shop and hired several Gun ships to shoot your cannon crew. You must defend your castle and shoot down the balloons and the invading ships.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Heimdall, a demi-god based in Norse mythology. Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three lands: the land of men (Midgard), the land of giants (Utgard) and the land of the gods (Asgard). You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these lands to collect the god's weapons. Each land has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms. When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.</desc>

		<desc>The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.</desc>

		<name>Hoverbod</name>
		<desc>Hoverbod is an action puzzle game where the player controls a yellow spherical droid who has to retrieve some stolen treasure from the bad guy Barriuss Stearneruss. The game is played from a side view perspective and initially the player is limited to rolling the sphere left and right. However by picking up a collectable the ability to hover in the air is granted. There are two different hover collectables which decide how high the sphere can move vertically. Another collectable is the missile which allows the sphere to shoot monsters and blast through blocks. Some missile collectables only make it possible to shoot in one direction and a second one has to be collected to be able to shoot both left and right. The monsters are called Ibbles and Squibbles and will kill the sphere on contact. Other dangers include spikes but these can be reversed by picking up the right collectable. Oxygen is limited and a level has to be completed before it runs out although more can be collected. The game contains eight levels where the objective is to collect all diamonds. Upon the completion of one a password is given which allows the player to start on the next one. After all eight levels have been completed the game moves on to a final level called the Castle of Gribb. The objective there is to collect 500 feathers that are needed to build two giant wings used to fly home. In the castle there is a new enemy type, the Gribbles, who grow and multiply uncontrollably.</desc>

As the titular viking the player can walk around the levels and jump both upwards and straight forward. Some enemies will be in the way and these can usually be dealt with by throwing daggers. There are also various hazards to watch out for like falling boulders and collapsing bridges. Daggers are limited in supply but more can be collected throughout the levels. There are also other collectibles that are needed to progress such as keys to open doors. The game contains two sets of level, one easy and one hard, and each is made up of eight levels. The easy levels can be played in any order while in the hard levels a password is required to skip to later levels.

		<desc>Squash simulations are something of a rarity, and it was this niché that Krisalis aimed one of their many sports simulations into. The rules of squash are accurately recreated, with a realistic court layout (viewed isometrically) and a need to hit legal shots. Three different ball speeds, variable match lengths and an 'easy' mode are on offer. Different tournament types are on offer, at 'club' and 'tournament' levels, with a customisable ladder system of multiple divisions to rise up. There is a full roster of opponents to play in one-off or tournament modes.</desc>

		<name>Jet Fighter</name>
		<desc>Jet Fighter is a variant of Jetpac that is largely the same as the original game but features a larger play area and different types of enemies. The player controls an astronaut that first has to collect all three parts of his rocket and then fully fuel it so that it can take off. The rocket parts are located on various platforms that the astronaut has to use his jetpack to reach. After the rocket has been fully assembled fuel will start falling from the sky and once enough of it has been collected the rocket will automatically ascend.

The game is entirely played with the mouse, using one button to thrust upwards and the other to shoot at the strange beings that fly around. Any contact with these will lead to a lost life and the game ends on the third. There is also a time limit for each level. By shooting the beings points are earned and bonuses are earned by collecting falling objects.</desc>

		<desc>Professor Mariarti is, as the game title suggests, a mad scientist. Not all of his experiments worked out the way they should and now he needs to shut down the power in five of his labs (the first four can be tackled in any order). This plays out as a standard platformer: Mariarti jumps over gaps between platforms and dodges enemies (he can take a few hits before dying) until he reaches the end of the level, i.e. the off switch.

At the start of the game he only throw wrenches to defend himself, but during the game he finds coins scattered around the labs. Those can be used to buy more advanced weapons like a laser cannon. However, killed enemies respawn after a short time. To proceed he also needs to solve a few puzzles by collecting items and bringing them to the correct place. There are also a number of switch puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>In Magic Pockets, the player controls the cool Bitmap Kid who has deep pockets that can store virtually anything. Bitmap Kid's mission is to get back his toys that were stolen by some creatures. The game is a side-scrolling shooter that plays out across four worlds inhabited by a variety of enemies. The player can cause more damage to these enemies by charging their shots before firing. The player's weapon also changes its shape and features according to the requirements of each world. The Bitmap Kid has special athletic abilities. He can jump high by stepping on whirlwinds and can even destroy all the creatures he hits after falling down from a high place. In addition, he also can ride a bike, dive and even fly thanks to the special items he encounters on the way.</desc>

		<name>Minotaur</name>
		<desc>Minotaur is a maze game played from a first person perspective. It is based on the Greek myth where King Minos sent a group of young Athenians to be fed by the Minotaur in the Labyrinth of Crete. The player's task is to enter the labyrinth, save as many men as possible and then escape before getting killed. The player has to reach the men before the minotaur or else they will die. The labyrinth is randomly generated at start up and it's possible for the player to enter its size. While moving around the labyrinth the player will come across various items that can be picked up. Most common are the food cans and the bottles which are necessary to avoid thirst or starvation. There are also compasses and pieces of a map that make it easier to find a way through the labyrinth. To be able to kill the minotaur, the player first has to find a sword and will then kill it automatically upon contact. If not in possession of a sword the player can press the spacebar to quickly run away from the minotaur. It will however cause all collected items to disappear.</desc>

		<name>Nebulus</name>
		<desc>Nebulus (aka Tower Toppler) was ported to the Archimedes by Krisalis.

You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.
You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.
The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.
Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

		<desc>Orion is a side scrolling shooter similar to Defender. Marauding aliens are attacking the player's home planet and it's his task to defend it and it's civilians. This is done by controlling a space craft left and right over the planet surface while blasting away at the various enemy forces that both try to take down the player and abduct the people standing on the ground. If an alien catches a human and drags it to the top of the screen it will mutate and become a dangerous enemy. Humans that fall from a shot down enemy can be saved by flying into them and then carried back to the surface. If all civilians die the planet will explode but the action will continue in deep space against a swarm of mutated aliens. In addition to the regular fire the player also has access to a limited supply of smart bombs that kill all aliens on the screen. There's also a hyperspace button that allow the player to quickly travel to another part of the stage but using it too much might lead to death.</desc>

Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/MFMBitstreams/Pipe Mania (United Kingdom) (F1028101).jfd</path>
		<name>Pipemania</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

The game can be played using keyboard and/or analogue joystick. In 2 player mode joystick can only be selected by player 1.</desc>

		<desc>Poizone is a Pengo variant with an ecological theme. The player controls the penguin Zozo as he attempts to decontaminate each of the game's 50 levels. Like in Pengo each level contains blocks that can be pushed or destroyed. It differs though in that the main objective is not to kill the enemies but to destroy a number of toxic blocks. To complete a level 90% of these blocks have to be destroyed and it has to happen before time runs out.

There are eight kinds of toxic blocks and each has its own way to be destroyed. For example some blocks has to be destroyed from a specific direction while some has to be pushed away. Destroying a toxic block in the wrong way leads to a lost life. A life is also lost when making contact with a monster. Some other blocks exist such as power pills that can be used to avoid monsters and diamonds that give bonuses.</desc>

		<name>Revelation!</name>
		<desc>Revelation is an abstract puzzle game based around cracking codes on safes. Each of the 80-plus levels is a top-down view of an arrangement of locks and dials, which must be aligned so as to unlock each section by having identical colors touching each other. Not all locks can be moved however, and all of this must be done within a time-limit. Your time to collect the gold (by opening each of the 9 doors in sequence in the hope of finding lots of bling) is limited by how long you took to crack the code. There is a bonus game to unlock, as well as extra lives and special power-ups. A password system ensures that a level need only be cleared once.</desc>

		<desc>Rockfall is a Boulder Dash variant. It is not related to the Atari ST series with the same name more than being inspired by the same game. Like in the original game the objective is to collect a certain number of gems in each of the game's levels. At the same time falling boulders have to be avoided since being hit by one leads to a loss of life. There are also some creatures moving around the caves that the player can kill by letting boulders or gems fall on them. Some of them will then be turned into gems. There are also bombs that can be collected and used to kill the creatures. Once enough gems have been collected an exit will open that the player can escape through. This all has to be done before the timer reaches zero.</desc>

		<desc>S.W.I.V. is a vertical scrolling shooter and an unofficial follow-up to Sales Curve's conversion of the side scroller Tecmo arcade game Silkworm.

One player controls a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles pass over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also includes a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.

S.W.I.V definitions

Secret Weapons Installation Verification
Primary Objective : Verify existence of the enemy's secret weapons installations and destroy them.

Special Weapons Interdiction Vehicles
Secondary Objective - Interdiction mission : the destruction by military force of all enemy units</desc>

		<name>Tactic</name>
		<desc>A game of strategy and reflex directly adapted from the arcade to the Archimedes. You have to assemble the forms and colours to solve the various contracts. On completion of the 64 levels you reach the I.L.G. (Infinite Level Generator). Different coloured shapes appear at the top of your screen and drop down to the bottom and your job is to arrange them in various ways according to the contract you are given. In phase one you have to arrange spheres into vertical rows of three of the same colour - and you have to perform the feat four times to fulfil the contract. Phase two is similar, except that you have to arrange things horizontally in groups of three of the same colour - and do it five times. Phase three involves blocks of four shapes and diagonal lines of three, and so on with the phases getting harder. Other things also turn up at random on the screen. Most useful is the bonus which entitles you to move on to the next phase without completing your contract. There are also nasties which take points off your score and reverse the effect of your movement keys for a while.</desc>

The aim of the game is to move through the labyrinths of the monastery, collect treasures and use golden keys to unlock the Doors of Destiny. On each floor three goblets need to be collected. The monk is controlled from a side view which looks similar to a platform game but there is no jumping since the monk can levitate through the air. The monastery is full of strange objects that zaps the monk's energy when touched but these can be destroyed by throwing bombs. These bombs can be thrown through walls and at specific places it is also possible to walk through walls. Energy also decreases automatically with time and when throwing bombs which means the player can't take too long since a life is lost when energy runs out.</desc>

There are twelve different invaders in the game including one that takes two hits to kill. The invaders have three different kinds of bomb: normal bombs that drop straight down, spinning bombs that drop diagonally and homing bombs that seek out the player. A notable difference from Space Invaders is that the old shields are gone. Instead the laser base has a built in shield that can be activated for protection. The player starts out with two shields and get new ones at the start of each new wave. The UFOs acts as supply ships and will randomly drop power ups that the player can catch. Power ups include extra lives and shields, stopping the invaders from moving or dropping bombs and movable rockets. There's also a power up that makes the invaders invisible.

The game also comes with editors that allow the player to change sprites and wave formations.

Designed and programmed by Mark Dixon from Arc systems and Alien Images, All in Boxing is a fighting game that just can't be beat! Boasting a heaving hitting roaster of 6 fighters from the unstoppable 'Willie Win', 'Ed Strong', 'Hans Full', 'B.A. Sher', 'N.O. Kowt', and the USSR brute 'Ivor Hardpunch' the fun never stops! 



Once you choose your combatant it is time to train. So take to the bags, Mac, we've got work to do! But unlike your jaw you can't afford to slack-off because you only got twenty seconds before you have to make the entrance to the big match!



AND Here it is the moment we've all been waiting for, the fight of a life time that can be over as quickly as you count 7-8-9...

DING-DING DING.



In each round you are given the chance to train some more.  This gives you a boost depending how hard you work. These mini-games break up the monotony. From jumping rope to punching bags. It's just a matter of time before you pin him to the corner. 



So the question is... Do you have what it takes? Do you have the eye of the tiger?</desc>

		<desc>Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models. To escape the mansion, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place. Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons. Weapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.</desc>

		<desc>A futuristic 3D space shooter.

You are tasked with destroying a race known as the Rakonans. They have taken over a number of planets and it is your job to destroy the Rakonan colonies on these planets to an extent that they cannot survive and the planet is then 'sterlised'. It can then be re-colonised by the original inhabitants.

Upon starting the game your craft descends to the planet surface and the battle begins. There are plenty of things to destroy, mainly on the ground, but from time to time you will come under attack from flying saucers and other things in the sky. You are initially based on the ground, but it is possible take off and fly your craft around in the air. However your craft's energy is drained much quicker when flying so to recharge the energy levels you need to return to ground level and stay still for a while.

Your craft is protected by shields and they can take a number of hits before they are finally destroyed. Shields can be recharged by moving your craft away from enemy fire. Once the shields have been destroyed one single enemy shot will finish you off.

As you progress around the landscape you will encounter buildings and objects, all of which can be destroyed. However some don't need to be, for example there are small houses which can be flattened but these are harmless so you don't really need to worry about them too much. You should pay more attention to the other objects that fire back at you - these need to disposed of as soon as you see them.

When you have destroyed enough objects on the planet to sterilise it the mission will end. You will then be presented before the Royal Guild of Spacing who will assess your performance. You will also end up here when your game ends. There are nine planets to sterilise and at the start of the game only one is available so you have to complete each of the planets in order to gain access to the next one.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Sector/Archimedes Elite (Europe).adf</path>
		<name>Elite</name>
		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

		<desc>Moria is a roguelike computer game based heavily on J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings. The game's objective is to kill a Balrog, presumably Durin's Bane, deep within the Mines of Moria. A later port of Moria called Umoria (UNIX Moria) inspired the Angband roguelike game. This game influenced the preliminary design of Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo.</desc>

The game plays like any traditional platformer and involve jumping around and shoot at the abstract enemies that roam around. The player can pick up different guns such as a bazooka, a mini gun and others. The game has three levels (referred to as mental zones): ego, psyche and id. Ego is the easiest and needs to be completed before id is unlocked. Each level is big and requires exploring. The levels are full of items that the player can collect and get points for. The bottom right hand corner shows a bonus symbol and when collected the symbol will advance until it gets a star. The player will then be transported to a bonus room. The objective of each level is simply to find all eight brain cells and shut them down.</desc>

Break 147 is a snooker simulation. Upon loading you can choose which type of game you want. Demo mode in which 2 computer players will play against each other, Practice mode which is self explanatory, Match mode is a proper competitive match against the computer and finally in the tournament mode you play a different player in each round. The aim is to try and beat them all and get to the final and become the overall winner. With the single match mode and tournament mode, any of the opposition can be replaced by human opponents instead of the computer, so you can have up to 16 different people playing in the tournament if you so wish.

Superpool is basically the same as Break 147 but instead of a game of snooker you play pool. The game set up is the same with Demo mode , Single match, and the Tournament mode, as with Break 147 the official rules of the game are followed, and it is played on the same table as before just with a different set of balls. The sound effects, the style of gameplay and everything else is the same.</desc>

		<name>Bubble Fair</name>
		<desc>Bubble Fair is a variant of the arcade game Pang. The story involves the characters Inky and Jinky who arrive at a fair as soap bubbles start falling from the sky. The bubbles are the work of the sorcerer ARCphile who wants to control all stalls of the fair. To make him stop, Inky and Jinky challenge him to a duel. The duel involves a game of noughts and crosses where each stall represents a square. In each of the stalls the player has to catch the ice cream that is hidden within a bubble that blocks access to the stall. For each stall there are two ice creams to catch and when done that square is won. To win the whole game the player has to win the nought and crosses game four times.

Like in the arcade game, it is a platform game with single screen levels. Bubbles will bounce around and the player's task is to destroy them with the use of an upwards travelling rope attached balloon that when hitting a bubble splits it into smaller ones or destroys it completely. The game features power ups that are dropped when a bubble is hit. These can lead to both positive and negative effects including increased or decreased time or score, giving a shield, extra balloons or inverting the player's movement. In total there are 72 levels.</desc>

		<name>Cannon Fodder</name>
		<desc>Guide a team of up to six soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

Monsters appear as the levels progress. Some of these are harmless and generally get in the way but others are nasty and can kill you on contact. Another breed of monster will also fire at you, luckily you have your gun so you can zap them.
On later levels it's not just water that comes out of the pipes, but acid as well. This is dealt with in the same way but you must avoid contact with it. Other features which will appear throughout the game include remote control doors, dissolving blocks, and drip valves to name but a few.</desc>

		<name>Chocks Away</name>
		<desc>Chocks Away is a flight simulation game for the Acorn Archimedes. It was written by Andrew Hutchings and published by The Fourth Dimension. The game is loosely set in the First World War, though many elements are simplified and anachronistic. The player flies a single British Tiger Moth aircraft (despite the design dating from peacetime and being a trainer) on various missions against German forces. Free movement is allowed around each mission's map, though the aircraft does not have the fuel capacity to allow infinite roaming - instead it must return to the home airfield to refuel. The Tiger Moth carries a single fixed forward-firing machine gun with infinite ammunition. The player pilots the plane from an in-cockpit view, though a chase camera is used if they are shot down, showing the helpless demise of their aircraft.</desc>

		<name>Conqueror</name>
		<desc>In Conqueror, you are in command of one or more tanks on a battlefield against a set of computer-controlled opponents. Each battle level gives you greater numbers and more powerful tanks against increasingly menacing opponents with up to fifteen tanks on each side.
In each game you can choose between either having American and British, German or Russian forces, against one of the other two. Each Power has four types of tank - one light, two medium and one heavy - all based on geniune Second World War machines.
Conqueror is played in real time on a three-dimensional scrolling landscape with trees, houses and rivers (similar to Zarch).

Arcade game:
The first game consists of a series of battles with your group of tanks against the computer-driven ones. The first combination at level zero is an Amencan Chaffee - fast and light - against a Panzer III which is less powerful.

Attrition game:
You have a standard set of tanks - two light, two medium and a heavy - but the computer starts off with an inferior selection. In each successive battle, the computer's selection becomes more and more potent.

Strategy game:
In this you can choose the tanks you require from a fixed budget, and the computer does likewise. When you win a battle the budget increases. Within this game there are other options such as use of spotter planes and artillery fire which can be bought at the cost of some tank power.

At all levels you can choose between manual or automatic tank strategy, In the former you control where the tanks on your side go; in the latter this is controlled by the computer but you can override it.
Tactical control is via the map, you select a tank and click the position you want it to move to.</desc>

		<desc>EGO: Repton 4 should not be confused with the Repton 4 that was included in Repton Infinity. Gameplay wise it is quite different from previous releases in the Repton series. Although focus is still on puzzle solving the player controls Repton (or Ego as he is called here) from a top down perspective and the goal of each level is to collect puzzle pieces that have to be assembled into a picture of a famous person, building, painting etc. The player can only pick up one piece at a time and has to carry it to a frame in the middle of the level where it has to be placed at the right place. It's important to collect the pieces in the right order or else an empty place in the middle might be blocked by surrounding pieces. A piece can only be dropped at the right place and it is not possible to move pieces that have already been placed. The player also has to collect gems that are found all around the levels. The picture can not be completed unless all gems have been collected. Different obstacles exist too. Towers and trees might block the path and there are also holes to fall down into and androids to avoid. There are also transporters and conveyors that are needed to reach certain parts of the levels.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Sector/Elite (Europe).adf</path>
		<name>Elite</name>
		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

		<name>Flashback : The Quest for Identity</name>
		<desc>Flashback (aka Flashback: The Quest for Identity) incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving.

While a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground.

To defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information and compete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas.</desc>

Your only hope is to raise an army and fight back, but after your long absence you are an unknown heir to the land.

		<name>Jet Fighter</name>
		<desc>Jet Fighter is a variant of Jetpac that is largely the same as the original game but features a larger play area and different types of enemies. The player controls an astronaut that first has to collect all three parts of his rocket and then fully fuel it so that it can take off. The rocket parts are located on various platforms that the astronaut has to use his jetpack to reach. After the rocket has been fully assembled fuel will start falling from the sky and once enough of it has been collected the rocket will automatically ascend.

The game is entirely played with the mouse, using one button to thrust upwards and the other to shoot at the strange beings that fly around. Any contact with these will lead to a lost life and the game ends on the third. There is also a time limit for each level. By shooting the beings points are earned and bonuses are earned by collecting falling objects.</desc>

		<name>Leeds United Champions!</name>
		<desc>Leeds United Champions! is a managerial soccer simulation in which the player takes control of Leeds United, the English champions of the 1991/92 season, in the fourth division; the goal being to conquer the Premier League in the long run. The game is completely menu based and the sub-menus are reached through a list of icons in the main menu. In those menus the player can set all the usual options of the genre, e.g. training, transfer market, lineup, ticket prices, youth section or stadium expansion. There is no match presentation to speak of; just a screen representing a live ticker which gives out the goals and bookings. Each athlete has 15 stats which influence his performance on the field.</desc>

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings.

You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it.

		<name>Mad Professor Mariarti</name>
		<desc>Professor Mariarti is, as the game title suggests, a mad scientist. Not all of his experiments worked out the way they should and now he needs to shut down the power in five of his labs (the first four can be tackled in any order). This plays out as a standard platformer: Mariarti jumps over gaps between platforms and dodges enemies (he can take a few hits before dying) until he reaches the end of the level, i.e. the off switch.

At the start of the game he only throw wrenches to defend himself, but during the game he finds coins scattered around the labs. Those can be used to buy more advanced weapons like a laser cannon. However, killed enemies respawn after a short time. To proceed he also needs to solve a few puzzles by collecting items and bringing them to the correct place. There are also a number of switch puzzles.</desc>

As opposed to its predecessor, Super Fulcrum takes place in one big scenario instead of single missions. Your task is to represent the Soviet Union in a UN force sent to South America to defend a small country that is being threatened by a bigger and stronger neighbour. The game is relatively open-ended, allowing you to fulfill your missions in the way you see fit instead of monitoring your every step. All missions and their results are handled in your pilot's log.</desc>

Unlike the arcade game the monsters do not chase the player but move in straight lines and only change direction upon reaching a block. The monsters can be killed by throwing a bouncing magic ball or by making apples fall onto them. The magic balls does not recharge in the version but instead the player starts out with five of them. Other differences include that the apples can not be pushed and that there are no letter monsters. There are some special tiles that add puzzle solving elements to the game. There are electric cables which kill the player on contact, bombs that detonate when triggered and sliders which push the wizard across the screen. The game can be customized and it is possible to turn off both the special tiles as well as the monsters and apples. There is also an option to play levels in normal, random or reversed order. In total the game contains 60 levels and a built-in editor can be used to modify them or to create new ones.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Sector/Nebulus (Europe).adf</path>
		<name>Nebulus</name>
		<desc>Nebulus (aka Tower Toppler) was ported to the Archimedes by Krisalis.

You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.
You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.
The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.
Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<desc>A fleet of space freighters carry a cargo of battle and security robots to help in the defence of Basmyth. Alien ships were bombarding the freighters with disorienting beams which drove the robots crazy. The human officers were eliminated, leaving the ships open for occupation by alien forces. At this point the players mission starts...

You control a cybernetic influence device (ID) which has been teleported aboard the first freighter to eliminate all the droids and robots. Two ways are possible to clean the ship decks representing the action part and the more strategy part of the game: Shooting (action) to destroy the robots or connecting itself into an other robot's brain (strategy) and take temporarily control of it.

It's possible to play the game as a simple shoot-em-up game, but the main part of Paradroid 90 is the transfer game to take control of other droids.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Sector/Pipe Mania (Europe).adf</path>
		<name>Pipe Mania!!</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

The game can be played using keyboard and/or analogue joystick. In 2 player mode joystick can only be selected by player 1.</desc>

		<name>Poizone</name>
		<desc>Poizone is a Pengo variant with an ecological theme. The player controls the penguin Zozo as he attempts to decontaminate each of the game's 50 levels. Like in Pengo each level contains blocks that can be pushed or destroyed. It differs though in that the main objective is not to kill the enemies but to destroy a number of toxic blocks. To complete a level 90% of these blocks have to be destroyed and it has to happen before time runs out.

There are eight kinds of toxic blocks and each has its own way to be destroyed. For example some blocks has to be destroyed from a specific direction while some has to be pushed away. Destroying a toxic block in the wrong way leads to a lost life. A life is also lost when making contact with a monster. Some other blocks exist such as power pills that can be used to avoid monsters and diamonds that give bonuses.</desc>

		<desc>Repton 3, released 5 November 1986, was developed by Matthew Atkinson at Superior's invitation since Tim Tyler wasn't interested in programming it—although he did design some of the levels for the new game. While the first two games had only taken a month each to program, Repton 3 took eight months.[1] It reverts to the form of a series of time-limited, password-protected levels. A few new features were introduced: fungus (a substance that gradually spreads wherever it finds space and kills Repton on contact), time capsules (resetting the current level's time limit each time one is collected), crowns and a timebomb which must be defused to complete each level. The inclusion of the timebomb means that, as well as collecting all of the diamonds and crowns, the user has to plan their route so as to finish up at the timebomb at the end of the level.</desc>

		<name>Simon The Sorcerer</name>
		<desc>Simon is just an ordinary boy living in modern-day England. One day, his dog Chippy discovers a chest with a book inside, entitled Ye Olde Spellbooke. Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.

Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue.

Like in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</desc>

		<desc>Simon is just an ordinary boy living in modern-day England. One day, his dog Chippy discovers a chest with a book inside, entitled Ye Olde Spellbooke. Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.

Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue.

Like in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</desc>

		<name>Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.

You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.

The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.

You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.

A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.</desc>

		<name>Star Fighter 3000</name>
		<desc>StarFighter 3000 is a space combat simulation featuring air-to-air and air-to-ground combat with over 50 varied missions spread across 4 levels.
There are enemy fighters, heat seeking missiles and space cruisers to deal with, not to mention enemy SAM sites and radar installations.
The laser can be used to destroy defences by targeting the ground they are on.
By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.
The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game is over, but the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.</desc>

		<name>Star Fighter 3000</name>
		<desc>StarFighter 3000 is a space combat simulation featuring air-to-air and air-to-ground combat with over 50 varied missions spread across 4 levels.
There are enemy fighters, heat seeking missiles and space cruisers to deal with, not to mention enemy SAM sites and radar installations.
The laser can be used to destroy defences by targeting the ground they are on.
By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.
The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game is over, but the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.</desc>

		<name>Starch</name>
		<desc>Players play as two manual workers, Harry and Dave, on a frantic clothes-cleaning night shift. In addition to the two main characters the game also includes a computer controlled character called Sam that attempts to stop the progress of the main characters.
There are five different levels to complete, each consisting of a specific task. In order to complete a task the player has to work out how to operate various pieces of machinery controlled by buttons, levers and ropes.
Each level ends when the available time expires or a specific quota is met. Following the completion of each level the two characters are shown in the manager's office. If the level has been successfully completed then they jump up in the air in celebration. If the level has not been completed then the manager pulls a lever that opens a trap door, while uttering the words "you're fired!"

The game supports either one or two simultaneous players. In one player mode the second character is controlled by the computer.</desc>

		<name>SWIV</name>
		<desc>S.W.I.V. is a vertical scrolling shooter and an unofficial follow-up to Sales Curve's conversion of the side scroller Tecmo arcade game Silkworm.

One player controls a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles pass over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also includes a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.

S.W.I.V definitions

Secret Weapons Installation Verification
Primary Objective : Verify existence of the enemy's secret weapons installations and destroy them.

Special Weapons Interdiction Vehicles
Secondary Objective - Interdiction mission : the destruction by military force of all enemy units</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Sector/Trivial Pursuit (Europe).adf</path>
		<name>Trivial Pursuit : The Computer Game, Genus Edition</name>
		<desc>A home computer version of the board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

Two game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

The question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art &amp; Literature, Science &amp; Nature, Geography, History, Sports &amp; Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music.

One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</desc>

This left the way clear for evil men such as Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. Only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces.

As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.

		<name>Warlocks</name>
		<desc>A platform shoot-em-up featuring a reincarnated knight who was tasked with freeing the world of Lylvania from the tyranny of 3 demented Warlocks.  The game set over ten large levels. The early levels are reasonably linear, but they soon become larger, requiring much exploration. Hidden rooms and caves can be found, containing extra lives, magical power-ups and level warps. Other features of this game are smooth parallax scrolling, thunder and lightning, rain, animating backdrops, stunning 256 colour graphics and great sound effects and music.

This game has been reviewed in:

Acorn Computing, Christmas Special December 1993 (with coverdisc demo)
Archimedes World, January 1994
Acorn User, February 1994
Acorn Action, Spring 1994

The game requires 1Mb of ram and RiscOS 2 or higher, but as it uses some minor video trickery, it will not work properly on VIDC2 machines without a software VIDC patch. It is compatible with the standard Acorn joysticks.

To enter the first hidden room, on level one after the second drop, walk left as far as you can and through the wall. This room continues past the water-fall, where you must stand on a chest and jump into the wall next to it to gain access to the third hidden part. When climbing the ladder out of the hidden room, walk into the far archway to be transported to the next level.

Many other hidden rooms are spread throughout the levels.

The levels are:

1 - The Forest
2 - The Graveyard
3 - The Waterfall
4 - The First Encounter
5 - The Giant Forest
6 - The Caves
7 - Skull Island
8 - The Volcano
9 - The Second Encounter
10 - The Castle</desc>

The game requires 1Mb of ram and RiscOS 2 or higher, but as it uses some minor video trickery, it will not work properly on VIDC2 machines without a software VIDC patch. It is compatible with the standard Acorn joysticks.

To enter the first hidden room, on level one after the second drop, walk left as far as you can and through the wall. This room continues past the water-fall, where you must stand on a chest and jump into the wall next to it to gain access to the third hidden part. When climbing the ladder out of the hidden room, walk into the far archway to be transported to the next level.

Many other hidden rooms are spread throughout the levels.

The levels are:

1 - The Forest
2 - The Graveyard
3 - The Waterfall
4 - The First Encounter
5 - The Giant Forest
6 - The Caves
7 - Skull Island
8 - The Volcano
9 - The Second Encounter
10 - The Castle</desc>

		<desc>White Magic is a Gauntlet type RPG which is viewed from above. The objective of the game is to complete all of the 32 levels. The ultimate aim is to do this without using the jump level option. In order to complete a level you must collect all of the treasure and then find the key to the exit before the time runs out. On your way to the exit you have to collect keys to open other doors. There are also many other items to discover such as potions, time pills, shields, extra ammo and swords to name but a few. Some of these items are useful and will help you in your quest others may not be so useful. There are also plenty of traps and enemies. Enemies include ghosts, spectres, guards and trolls. There are four characters in the game. They are Kaldor the Leprechaun, Moriana the Warrior, Cheysul the Titan and Mandrake the Enchanter, each of these characters have their own strengths and weaknesses plus special powers. You can switch between characters during the game so that you can use that particular characters special strengths to solve a particular puzzle, such as climbing over a log or cutting down vines. If any of the characters energy level reaches zero then the game is over.</desc>

		<name>The WIMP Game</name>
		<desc>The wimp game is a brilliant pointer driven graphic adventure celebrating over 10 years of Acorn Home Computers

This was one of the early RISC OS games and was the first commercial game that operated just in the desktop.

The game takes place in a house and your objective is to move through each room solving the puzzles within to gain access to the next room. The overall objective of the game is to become the owner of the best Acorn computer available, which at the time that this game was written was an R200 workstation.
You start off as an Acorn Atom owner and along the way to your R200 workstation, you become the owner of an Electron, BBC Micro, BBC Master and A3000. There are no Risc PC's here, so it gives you an idea of how old the game is. You can click the mouse menu button over the main game screen at anytime during the game and highlight the 'Status' option to show you which Acorn machine you currently own.

Control of the game is by the mouse, which involves pointing and clicking on items and artifacts in the room. Some of these are needed to complete the room, and others are simply red herrings. You can also kill yourself by touching (clicking) things that would normally harm you in the real world.</desc>

		<desc>In World Championship Boxing Manager the player can develop the careers of aspiring heavyweight boxers. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing the manager's office.

Training the boxers involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.</desc>

		<desc>Zool (aka Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension) is a platform game ported to the Acorn Archimedes by James Byrne of Cygnus Software.

His name is Zool, and he is a gremlin-like creature from another dimension. He is forced to land on the Earth, but his sole goal is to attain the prestigious ranking of a Ninja. To do that, Zool will have to travel through six worlds, each divided into three stages, defeat his enemies, and prove himself worthy of that title.
Zool is a fast-paced side-scrolling platformer. The protagonist can run, jump, climb walls, and shoot enemies. Power-ups for Zool are scattered across the levels. These include life-spending hearts, smart bombs, shields, more powerful jump-skill and a twin Zool. This "twin" imitates the original's motions a few seconds after he performs them.

Zool was notable for the use of commercial product placement throughout the game's levels.</desc>

		<name>Alien Invasion</name>
		<desc>Alien Invasion is a fixed screen shoot 'em up based on Space Invaders but with some additions to the gameplay. There are twelve different invaders in the game including one that takes two hits to kill. The invaders have three different kinds of bomb: normal bombs that drop straight down, spinning bombs that drop diagonally and homing bombs that seek out the player. A notable difference from Space Invaders is that the old shields are gone. Instead the laser base has a built in shield that can be activated for protection. The player starts out with two shields and get new ones at the start of each new wave. The UFOs acts as supply ships and will randomly drop power ups that the player can catch. Power ups include extra lives and shields, stopping the invaders from moving or dropping bombs and movable rockets. There's also a power up that makes the invaders invisible.

The game also comes with editors that allow the player to change sprites and wave formations.

		<name>All-In Boxing</name>
		<desc>Let's get ready to Ruuuummmmblllle!!!



Designed and programmed by Mark Dixon from Arc systems and Alien Images, All in Boxing is a fighting game that just can't be beat! Boasting a heaving hitting roaster of 6 fighters from the unstoppable 'Willie Win', 'Ed Strong', 'Hans Full', 'B.A. Sher', 'N.O. Kowt', and the USSR brute 'Ivor Hardpunch' the fun never stops! 



Once you choose your combatant it is time to train. So take to the bags, Mac, we've got work to do! But unlike your jaw you can't afford to slack-off because you only got twenty seconds before you have to make the entrance to the big match!



AND Here it is the moment we've all been waiting for, the fight of a life time that can be over as quickly as you count 7-8-9...

DING-DING DING.



In each round you are given the chance to train some more.  This gives you a boost depending how hard you work. These mini-games break up the monotony. From jumping rope to punching bags. It's just a matter of time before you pin him to the corner. 



So the question is... Do you have what it takes? Do you have the eye of the tiger?</desc>

		<name>Alone In the Dark</name>
		<desc>Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models. To escape the mansion, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place. Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons. Weapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.</desc>

		<desc>A futuristic 3D space shooter.

You are tasked with destroying a race known as the Rakonans. They have taken over a number of planets and it is your job to destroy the Rakonan colonies on these planets to an extent that they cannot survive and the planet is then 'sterlised'. It can then be re-colonised by the original inhabitants.

Upon starting the game your craft descends to the planet surface and the battle begins. There are plenty of things to destroy, mainly on the ground, but from time to time you will come under attack from flying saucers and other things in the sky. You are initially based on the ground, but it is possible take off and fly your craft around in the air. However your craft's energy is drained much quicker when flying so to recharge the energy levels you need to return to ground level and stay still for a while.

Your craft is protected by shields and they can take a number of hits before they are finally destroyed. Shields can be recharged by moving your craft away from enemy fire. Once the shields have been destroyed one single enemy shot will finish you off.

As you progress around the landscape you will encounter buildings and objects, all of which can be destroyed. However some don't need to be, for example there are small houses which can be flattened but these are harmless so you don't really need to worry about them too much. You should pay more attention to the other objects that fire back at you - these need to disposed of as soon as you see them.

When you have destroyed enough objects on the planet to sterilise it the mission will end. You will then be presented before the Royal Guild of Spacing who will assess your performance. You will also end up here when your game ends. There are nine planets to sterilise and at the start of the game only one is available so you have to complete each of the planets in order to gain access to the next one.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/SectorDumps/Archimedes Elite (Europe).adf</path>
		<name>Elite</name>
		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/SectorDumps/Break 147 (United Kingdom).adf</path>
		<name>Break 147</name>
		<desc>A Snooker and Pool simulator game.

Break 147 is a snooker simulation. Upon loading you can choose which type of game you want. Demo mode in which 2 computer players will play against each other, Practice mode which is self explanatory, Match mode is a proper competitive match against the computer and finally in the tournament mode you play a different player in each round. The aim is to try and beat them all and get to the final and become the overall winner. With the single match mode and tournament mode, any of the opposition can be replaced by human opponents instead of the computer, so you can have up to 16 different people playing in the tournament if you so wish.

Superpool is basically the same as Break 147 but instead of a game of snooker you play pool. The game set up is the same with Demo mode , Single match, and the Tournament mode, as with Break 147 the official rules of the game are followed, and it is played on the same table as before just with a different set of balls. The sound effects, the style of gameplay and everything else is the same.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/SectorDumps/Bubble Fair (Europe).adf</path>
		<name>Bubble Fair</name>
		<desc>Bubble Fair is a variant of the arcade game Pang. The story involves the characters Inky and Jinky who arrive at a fair as soap bubbles start falling from the sky. The bubbles are the work of the sorcerer ARCphile who wants to control all stalls of the fair. To make him stop, Inky and Jinky challenge him to a duel. The duel involves a game of noughts and crosses where each stall represents a square. In each of the stalls the player has to catch the ice cream that is hidden within a bubble that blocks access to the stall. For each stall there are two ice creams to catch and when done that square is won. To win the whole game the player has to win the nought and crosses game four times.

Like in the arcade game, it is a platform game with single screen levels. Bubbles will bounce around and the player's task is to destroy them with the use of an upwards travelling rope attached balloon that when hitting a bubble splits it into smaller ones or destroys it completely. The game features power ups that are dropped when a bubble is hit. These can lead to both positive and negative effects including increased or decreased time or score, giving a shield, extra balloons or inverting the player's movement. In total there are 72 levels.</desc>

		<name>Cannon Fodder</name>
		<desc>Guide a team of up to six soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<desc>Chocks Away is a flight simulation game for the Acorn Archimedes. It was written by Andrew Hutchings and published by The Fourth Dimension. The game is loosely set in the First World War, though many elements are simplified and anachronistic. The player flies a single British Tiger Moth aircraft (despite the design dating from peacetime and being a trainer) on various missions against German forces. Free movement is allowed around each mission's map, though the aircraft does not have the fuel capacity to allow infinite roaming - instead it must return to the home airfield to refuel. The Tiger Moth carries a single fixed forward-firing machine gun with infinite ammunition. The player pilots the plane from an in-cockpit view, though a chase camera is used if they are shot down, showing the helpless demise of their aircraft.</desc>

		<name>Chocks Away</name>
		<desc>Chocks Away is a flight simulation game for the Acorn Archimedes. It was written by Andrew Hutchings and published by The Fourth Dimension. The game is loosely set in the First World War, though many elements are simplified and anachronistic. The player flies a single British Tiger Moth aircraft (despite the design dating from peacetime and being a trainer) on various missions against German forces. Free movement is allowed around each mission's map, though the aircraft does not have the fuel capacity to allow infinite roaming - instead it must return to the home airfield to refuel. The Tiger Moth carries a single fixed forward-firing machine gun with infinite ammunition. The player pilots the plane from an in-cockpit view, though a chase camera is used if they are shot down, showing the helpless demise of their aircraft.</desc>

		<name>Conqueror</name>
		<desc>In Conqueror, you are in command of one or more tanks on a battlefield against a set of computer-controlled opponents. Each battle level gives you greater numbers and more powerful tanks against increasingly menacing opponents with up to fifteen tanks on each side.
In each game you can choose between either having American and British, German or Russian forces, against one of the other two. Each Power has four types of tank - one light, two medium and one heavy - all based on geniune Second World War machines.
Conqueror is played in real time on a three-dimensional scrolling landscape with trees, houses and rivers (similar to Zarch).

Arcade game:
The first game consists of a series of battles with your group of tanks against the computer-driven ones. The first combination at level zero is an Amencan Chaffee - fast and light - against a Panzer III which is less powerful.

Attrition game:
You have a standard set of tanks - two light, two medium and a heavy - but the computer starts off with an inferior selection. In each successive battle, the computer's selection becomes more and more potent.

Strategy game:
In this you can choose the tanks you require from a fixed budget, and the computer does likewise. When you win a battle the budget increases. Within this game there are other options such as use of spotter planes and artillery fire which can be bought at the cost of some tank power.

At all levels you can choose between manual or automatic tank strategy, In the former you control where the tanks on your side go; in the latter this is controlled by the computer but you can override it.
Tactical control is via the map, you select a tank and click the position you want it to move to.</desc>

		<name>EGO: Repton 4</name>
		<desc>EGO: Repton 4 should not be confused with the Repton 4 that was included in Repton Infinity. Gameplay wise it is quite different from previous releases in the Repton series. Although focus is still on puzzle solving the player controls Repton (or Ego as he is called here) from a top down perspective and the goal of each level is to collect puzzle pieces that have to be assembled into a picture of a famous person, building, painting etc. The player can only pick up one piece at a time and has to carry it to a frame in the middle of the level where it has to be placed at the right place. It's important to collect the pieces in the right order or else an empty place in the middle might be blocked by surrounding pieces. A piece can only be dropped at the right place and it is not possible to move pieces that have already been placed. The player also has to collect gems that are found all around the levels. The picture can not be completed unless all gems have been collected. Different obstacles exist too. Towers and trees might block the path and there are also holes to fall down into and androids to avoid. There are also transporters and conveyors that are needed to reach certain parts of the levels.</desc>

		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

		<name>Flashback : The Quest for Identity</name>
		<desc>Flashback (aka Flashback: The Quest for Identity) incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving.

While a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground.

To defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information and compete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas.</desc>

You control Pond, a fish-like creature, who has to complete several missions, while making his way through levels full of dangers and hostile creatures. It is not a typical "jump and run" game: instead of breezing through large levels, Pond has to complete unique missions for each game area: free hostages, detonate a structure, find keys, etc. It is possible to exit a level only after having completed the objective. Many missions are timed.</desc>

		<name>Jet Fighter</name>
		<desc>Jet Fighter is a variant of Jetpac that is largely the same as the original game but features a larger play area and different types of enemies. The player controls an astronaut that first has to collect all three parts of his rocket and then fully fuel it so that it can take off. The rocket parts are located on various platforms that the astronaut has to use his jetpack to reach. After the rocket has been fully assembled fuel will start falling from the sky and once enough of it has been collected the rocket will automatically ascend.

The game is entirely played with the mouse, using one button to thrust upwards and the other to shoot at the strange beings that fly around. Any contact with these will lead to a lost life and the game ends on the third. There is also a time limit for each level. By shooting the beings points are earned and bonuses are earned by collecting falling objects.</desc>

		<desc>Leeds United Champions! is a managerial soccer simulation in which the player takes control of Leeds United, the English champions of the 1991/92 season, in the fourth division; the goal being to conquer the Premier League in the long run. The game is completely menu based and the sub-menus are reached through a list of icons in the main menu. In those menus the player can set all the usual options of the genre, e.g. training, transfer market, lineup, ticket prices, youth section or stadium expansion. There is no match presentation to speak of; just a screen representing a live ticker which gives out the goals and bookings. Each athlete has 15 stats which influence his performance on the field.</desc>

		<name>Mad Professor Mariarti</name>
		<desc>Professor Mariarti is, as the game title suggests, a mad scientist. Not all of his experiments worked out the way they should and now he needs to shut down the power in five of his labs (the first four can be tackled in any order). This plays out as a standard platformer: Mariarti jumps over gaps between platforms and dodges enemies (he can take a few hits before dying) until he reaches the end of the level, i.e. the off switch.

At the start of the game he only throw wrenches to defend himself, but during the game he finds coins scattered around the labs. Those can be used to buy more advanced weapons like a laser cannon. However, killed enemies respawn after a short time. To proceed he also needs to solve a few puzzles by collecting items and bringing them to the correct place. There are also a number of switch puzzles.</desc>

As opposed to its predecessor, Super Fulcrum takes place in one big scenario instead of single missions. Your task is to represent the Soviet Union in a UN force sent to South America to defend a small country that is being threatened by a bigger and stronger neighbour. The game is relatively open-ended, allowing you to fulfill your missions in the way you see fit instead of monitoring your every step. All missions and their results are handled in your pilot's log.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Doo</name>
		<desc>Mr Doo is a variant of the arcade game Mr. Do! which makes some changes to the original design. The player controls a wizard who has to collect cherries and avoid various monsters. Unlike the arcade game the monsters do not chase the player but move in straight lines and only change direction upon reaching a block. The monsters can be killed by throwing a bouncing magic ball or by making apples fall onto them. The magic balls does not recharge in the version but instead the player starts out with five of them. Other differences include that the apples can not be pushed and that there are no letter monsters. There are some special tiles that add puzzle solving elements to the game. There are electric cables which kill the player on contact, bombs that detonate when triggered and sliders which push the wizard across the screen. The game can be customized and it is possible to turn off both the special tiles as well as the monsters and apples. There is also an option to play levels in normal, random or reversed order. In total the game contains 60 levels and a built-in editor can be used to modify them or to create new ones.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Doo</name>
		<desc>Mr Doo is a variant of the arcade game Mr. Do! which makes some changes to the original design. The player controls a wizard who has to collect cherries and avoid various monsters. Unlike the arcade game the monsters do not chase the player but move in straight lines and only change direction upon reaching a block. The monsters can be killed by throwing a bouncing magic ball or by making apples fall onto them. The magic balls does not recharge in the version but instead the player starts out with five of them. Other differences include that the apples can not be pushed and that there are no letter monsters. There are some special tiles that add puzzle solving elements to the game. There are electric cables which kill the player on contact, bombs that detonate when triggered and sliders which push the wizard across the screen. The game can be customized and it is possible to turn off both the special tiles as well as the monsters and apples. There is also an option to play levels in normal, random or reversed order. In total the game contains 60 levels and a built-in editor can be used to modify them or to create new ones.</desc>

		<name>Nebulus</name>
		<desc>Nebulus (aka Tower Toppler) was ported to the Archimedes by Krisalis.

You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.
You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.
The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.
Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

Alien ships were bombarding the freighters with disorienting beams which drove the robots crazy. The human officers were eliminated, leaving the ships open for occupation by alien forces. At this point the players mission starts...

You control a cybernetic influence device (ID) which has been teleported aboard the first freighter to eliminate all the droids and robots. Two ways are possible to clean the ship decks representing the action part and the more strategy part of the game: Shooting (action) to destroy the robots or connecting itself into an other robot's brain (strategy) and take temporarily control of it.

It's possible to play the game as a simple shoot-em-up game, but the main part of Paradroid 90 is the transfer game to take control of other droids.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/SectorDumps/Pipe Mania (Europe).adf</path>
		<name>Pipe Mania!!</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

The game can be played using keyboard and/or analogue joystick. In 2 player mode joystick can only be selected by player 1.</desc>

		<name>Poizone</name>
		<desc>Poizone is a Pengo variant with an ecological theme. The player controls the penguin Zozo as he attempts to decontaminate each of the game's 50 levels. Like in Pengo each level contains blocks that can be pushed or destroyed. It differs though in that the main objective is not to kill the enemies but to destroy a number of toxic blocks. To complete a level 90% of these blocks have to be destroyed and it has to happen before time runs out.

There are eight kinds of toxic blocks and each has its own way to be destroyed. For example some blocks has to be destroyed from a specific direction while some has to be pushed away. Destroying a toxic block in the wrong way leads to a lost life. A life is also lost when making contact with a monster. Some other blocks exist such as power pills that can be used to avoid monsters and diamonds that give bonuses.</desc>

While the first two games had only taken a month each to program, Repton 3 took eight months.[1] It reverts to the form of a series of time-limited, password-protected levels. A few new features were introduced: fungus (a substance that gradually spreads wherever it finds space and kills Repton on contact), time capsules (resetting the current level's time limit each time one is collected), crowns and a timebomb which must be defused to complete each level. The inclusion of the timebomb means that, as well as collecting all of the diamonds and crowns, the user has to plan their route so as to finish up at the timebomb at the end of the level.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/SectorDumps/Simon the Sorcerer (Europe) (Disk 1).adf</path>
		<name>Simon The Sorcerer</name>
		<desc>Simon is just an ordinary boy living in modern-day England. One day, his dog Chippy discovers a chest with a book inside, entitled Ye Olde Spellbooke. Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.

Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue.

Like in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</desc>

Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.

Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue.

Like in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</desc>

		<name>Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.

You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.

The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.

You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team.

		<name>Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.

You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.

The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.

You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.

A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.</desc>

		<desc>StarFighter 3000 is a space combat simulation featuring air-to-air and air-to-ground combat with over 50 varied missions spread across 4 levels.
There are enemy fighters, heat seeking missiles and space cruisers to deal with, not to mention enemy SAM sites and radar installations.
The laser can be used to destroy defences by targeting the ground they are on.
By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.
The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game is over, but the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.</desc>

		<name>Starch</name>
		<desc>Players play as two manual workers, Harry and Dave, on a frantic clothes-cleaning night shift. In addition to the two main characters the game also includes a computer controlled character called Sam that attempts to stop the progress of the main characters.
There are five different levels to complete, each consisting of a specific task. In order to complete a task the player has to work out how to operate various pieces of machinery controlled by buttons, levers and ropes.
Each level ends when the available time expires or a specific quota is met. Following the completion of each level the two characters are shown in the manager's office. If the level has been successfully completed then they jump up in the air in celebration. If the level has not been completed then the manager pulls a lever that opens a trap door, while uttering the words "you're fired!"

The game supports either one or two simultaneous players. In one player mode the second character is controlled by the computer.</desc>

		<desc>S.W.I.V. is a vertical scrolling shooter and an unofficial follow-up to Sales Curve's conversion of the side scroller Tecmo arcade game Silkworm.

One player controls a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles pass over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also includes a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.

S.W.I.V definitions

Secret Weapons Installation Verification
Primary Objective : Verify existence of the enemy's secret weapons installations and destroy them.

Special Weapons Interdiction Vehicles
Secondary Objective - Interdiction mission : the destruction by military force of all enemy units</desc>

		<name>Trivial Pursuit : The Computer Game, Genus Edition</name>
		<desc>A home computer version of the board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

Two game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

The question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art &amp; Literature, Science &amp; Nature, Geography, History, Sports &amp; Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music.

One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</desc>

		<name>Twinworld</name>
		<desc>After the Cariken family became complacent, the land of Gaspar ceased to be ruled as well. This left the way clear for evil men such as Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. Only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces.

As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.

Ported to the Archimedes by Cygnus Software.</desc>

		<name>Warlocks</name>
		<desc>A platform shoot-em-up featuring a reincarnated knight who was tasked with freeing the world of Lylvania from the tyranny of 3 demented Warlocks.  The game set over ten large levels. The early levels are reasonably linear, but they soon become larger, requiring much exploration. Hidden rooms and caves can be found, containing extra lives, magical power-ups and level warps. Other features of this game are smooth parallax scrolling, thunder and lightning, rain, animating backdrops, stunning 256 colour graphics and great sound effects and music.

This game has been reviewed in:

Acorn Computing, Christmas Special December 1993 (with coverdisc demo)
Archimedes World, January 1994
Acorn User, February 1994
Acorn Action, Spring 1994

The game requires 1Mb of ram and RiscOS 2 or higher, but as it uses some minor video trickery, it will not work properly on VIDC2 machines without a software VIDC patch. It is compatible with the standard Acorn joysticks.

To enter the first hidden room, on level one after the second drop, walk left as far as you can and through the wall. This room continues past the water-fall, where you must stand on a chest and jump into the wall next to it to gain access to the third hidden part. When climbing the ladder out of the hidden room, walk into the far archway to be transported to the next level.

Many other hidden rooms are spread throughout the levels.

The levels are:

1 - The Forest
2 - The Graveyard
3 - The Waterfall
4 - The First Encounter
5 - The Giant Forest
6 - The Caves
7 - Skull Island
8 - The Volcano
9 - The Second Encounter
10 - The Castle</desc>

		<desc>White Magic is a Gauntlet type RPG which is viewed from above. The objective of the game is to complete all of the 32 levels. The ultimate aim is to do this without using the jump level option. In order to complete a level you must collect all of the treasure and then find the key to the exit before the time runs out. On your way to the exit you have to collect keys to open other doors. There are also many other items to discover such as potions, time pills, shields, extra ammo and swords to name but a few. Some of these items are useful and will help you in your quest others may not be so useful. There are also plenty of traps and enemies. Enemies include ghosts, spectres, guards and trolls. There are four characters in the game. They are Kaldor the Leprechaun, Moriana the Warrior, Cheysul the Titan and Mandrake the Enchanter, each of these characters have their own strengths and weaknesses plus special powers. You can switch between characters during the game so that you can use that particular characters special strengths to solve a particular puzzle, such as climbing over a log or cutting down vines. If any of the characters energy level reaches zero then the game is over.</desc>

		<name>The WIMP Game</name>
		<desc>The wimp game is a brilliant pointer driven graphic adventure celebrating over 10 years of Acorn Home Computers

This was one of the early RISC OS games and was the first commercial game that operated just in the desktop.

The game takes place in a house and your objective is to move through each room solving the puzzles within to gain access to the next room. The overall objective of the game is to become the owner of the best Acorn computer available, which at the time that this game was written was an R200 workstation.
You start off as an Acorn Atom owner and along the way to your R200 workstation, you become the owner of an Electron, BBC Micro, BBC Master and A3000. There are no Risc PC's here, so it gives you an idea of how old the game is. You can click the mouse menu button over the main game screen at anytime during the game and highlight the 'Status' option to show you which Acorn machine you currently own.

Control of the game is by the mouse, which involves pointing and clicking on items and artifacts in the room. Some of these are needed to complete the room, and others are simply red herrings. You can also kill yourself by touching (clicking) things that would normally harm you in the real world.</desc>

		<desc>In World Championship Boxing Manager the player can develop the careers of aspiring heavyweight boxers. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing the manager's office.

Training the boxers involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.</desc>

		<name>Zool : Ninja of the “Nth” Dimension</name>
		<desc>Zool (aka Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension) is a platform game ported to the Acorn Archimedes by James Byrne of Cygnus Software.

His name is Zool, and he is a gremlin-like creature from another dimension. He is forced to land on the Earth, but his sole goal is to attain the prestigious ranking of a Ninja. To do that, Zool will have to travel through six worlds, each divided into three stages, defeat his enemies, and prove himself worthy of that title.
Zool is a fast-paced side-scrolling platformer. The protagonist can run, jump, climb walls, and shoot enemies. Power-ups for Zool are scattered across the levels. These include life-spending hearts, smart bombs, shields, more powerful jump-skill and a twin Zool. This "twin" imitates the original's motions a few seconds after he performs them.

Zool was notable for the use of commercial product placement throughout the game's levels.</desc>
