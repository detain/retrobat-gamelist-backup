		<name>Alien Invasion</name>
		<desc>Alien Invasion is a fixed screen shoot 'em up based on Space Invaders but with some additions to the gameplay. There are twelve different invaders in the game including one that takes two hits to kill. The invaders have three different kinds of bomb: normal bombs that drop straight down, spinning bombs that drop diagonally and homing bombs that seek out the player. A notable difference from Space Invaders is that the old shields are gone. Instead the laser base has a built in shield that can be activated for protection. The player starts out with two shields and get new ones at the start of each new wave. The UFOs acts as supply ships and will randomly drop power ups that the player can catch. Power ups include extra lives and shields, stopping the invaders from moving or dropping bombs and movable rockets. There's also a power up that makes the invaders invisible.

The game also comes with editors that allow the player to change sprites and wave formations.

Originally published by Alien Visions in 1990, it was re-released in 1994 by Archimedes World.</desc>

		<desc>Let's get ready to Ruuuummmmblllle!!!



Designed and programmed by Mark Dixon from Arc systems and Alien Images, All in Boxing is a fighting game that just can't be beat! Boasting a heaving hitting roaster of 6 fighters from the unstoppable 'Willie Win', 'Ed Strong', 'Hans Full', 'B.A. Sher', 'N.O. Kowt', and the USSR brute 'Ivor Hardpunch' the fun never stops! 



Once you choose your combatant it is time to train. So take to the bags, Mac, we've got work to do! But unlike your jaw you can't afford to slack-off because you only got twenty seconds before you have to make the entrance to the big match!



AND Here it is the moment we've all been waiting for, the fight of a life time that can be over as quickly as you count 7-8-9...

DING-DING DING.



In each round you are given the chance to train some more.  This gives you a boost depending how hard you work. These mini-games break up the monotony. From jumping rope to punching bags. It's just a matter of time before you pin him to the corner. 



So the question is... Do you have what it takes? Do you have the eye of the tiger?</desc>

		<name>Elite</name>
		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

		<name>Bubble Fair</name>
		<desc>Bubble Fair is a variant of the arcade game Pang. The story involves the characters Inky and Jinky who arrive at a fair as soap bubbles start falling from the sky. The bubbles are the work of the sorcerer ARCphile who wants to control all stalls of the fair. To make him stop, Inky and Jinky challenge him to a duel. The duel involves a game of noughts and crosses where each stall represents a square. In each of the stalls the player has to catch the ice cream that is hidden within a bubble that blocks access to the stall. For each stall there are two ice creams to catch and when done that square is won. To win the whole game the player has to win the nought and crosses game four times.

Like in the arcade game, it is a platform game with single screen levels. Bubbles will bounce around and the player's task is to destroy them with the use of an upwards travelling rope attached balloon that when hitting a bubble splits it into smaller ones or destroys it completely. The game features power ups that are dropped when a bubble is hit. These can lead to both positive and negative effects including increased or decreased time or score, giving a shield, extra balloons or inverting the player's movement. In total there are 72 levels.</desc>

		<name>Bug Hunter In Space</name>
		<desc>Bug Hunter in Space is a sequel to the original Bug Hunter game. Once again the player controls the Hysteron Proteron which this time is sent to deal with a fleet of alien space crafts. Each craft consists of a number of levels in which the player has to kill all the aliens before entering a teleport to move to the next one. If the craft is flying it is also necessary to shut down its engines and on the last level of each craft the player has to trigger the craft's reactor and escape before it blows up.

The game plays largely the same as its predecessor but it features larger scrolling levels. The Hysteron Proteron has no weapons (except for some that can be picked up at certain locations) but can walk on walls and ceilings and pick up certain objects. These objects have to be dropped on the aliens to kill them. Additionally it's possible to jump and activate devices but only when not carrying an object. The player has three lives and one is lost upon making contact with an alien.</desc>

		<name>Cannon Fodder</name>
		<desc>Guide a team of up to six soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<desc>Guide a team of up to six soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades or rockets, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies, buildings or some vehicles (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks that used make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<name>Conqueror</name>
		<desc>In Conqueror, you are in command of one or more tanks on a battlefield against a set of computer-controlled opponents. Each battle level gives you greater numbers and more powerful tanks against increasingly menacing opponents with up to fifteen tanks on each side.
In each game you can choose between either having American and British, German or Russian forces, against one of the other two. Each Power has four types of tank - one light, two medium and one heavy - all based on geniune Second World War machines.
Conqueror is played in real time on a three-dimensional scrolling landscape with trees, houses and rivers (similar to Zarch).

Arcade game:
The first game consists of a series of battles with your group of tanks against the computer-driven ones. The first combination at level zero is an Amencan Chaffee - fast and light - against a Panzer III which is less powerful.

Attrition game:
You have a standard set of tanks - two light, two medium and a heavy - but the computer starts off with an inferior selection. In each successive battle, the computer's selection becomes more and more potent.

Strategy game:
In this you can choose the tanks you require from a fixed budget, and the computer does likewise. When you win a battle the budget increases. Within this game there are other options such as use of spotter planes and artillery fire which can be bought at the cost of some tank power.

At all levels you can choose between manual or automatic tank strategy, In the former you control where the tanks on your side go; in the latter this is controlled by the computer but you can override it.
Tactical control is via the map, you select a tank and click the position you want it to move to.</desc>

Suddenly, there are attempts on his life, with the words 'insider dealings' floating around. The hero is framed for a crime he didn't commit, and must prove his innocence before it is too late.

The game is a text adventure with graphics; the player inputs verb commands to interact with the environment and advance the story. The gameplay focuses on realistic investigation and information-gathering rather than puzzle-solving.</desc>

		<desc>EGO: Repton 4 should not be confused with the Repton 4 that was included in Repton Infinity. Gameplay wise it is quite different from previous releases in the Repton series. Although focus is still on puzzle solving the player controls Repton (or Ego as he is called here) from a top down perspective and the goal of each level is to collect puzzle pieces that have to be assembled into a picture of a famous person, building, painting etc. The player can only pick up one piece at a time and has to carry it to a frame in the middle of the level where it has to be placed at the right place. It's important to collect the pieces in the right order or else an empty place in the middle might be blocked by surrounding pieces. A piece can only be dropped at the right place and it is not possible to move pieces that have already been placed. The player also has to collect gems that are found all around the levels. The picture can not be completed unless all gems have been collected. Different obstacles exist too. Towers and trees might block the path and there are also holes to fall down into and androids to avoid. There are also transporters and conveyors that are needed to reach certain parts of the levels.</desc>

		<name>Elite</name>
		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

		<name>Flashback : The Quest for Identity</name>
		<desc>Flashback (aka Flashback: The Quest for Identity) incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving.

While a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground.

To defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information and compete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas.</desc>

		<desc>The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.</desc>

Iron Lord is a strategy game with action and light adventure elements, set in the Middle Ages and featuring hand-drawn graphics. After returning from journeys far away, you find your ancestral castle in ruins, and hear rumors that a huge army is marching towards your land. Your only hope is to raise an army and fight back, but after your long absence you are an unknown heir to the land. To raise the army you need to win the respect of the people, by traveling through your land and accomplishing tasks, win competitions, and finally gather enough men to fight the army.</desc>

		<desc>Ported to the Archimedes by James Byrne of Cygnus Software.

Iron Lord is a strategy game with action and light adventure elements, set in the Middle Ages and featuring hand-drawn graphics. After returning from journeys far away, you find your ancestral castle in ruins, and hear rumors that a huge army is marching towards your land. Your only hope is to raise an army and fight back, but after your long absence you are an unknown heir to the land. To raise the army you need to win the respect of the people, by traveling through your land and accomplishing tasks, win competitions, and finally gather enough men to fight the army.</desc>

		<name>Jet Fighter</name>
		<desc>Jet Fighter is a variant of Jetpac that is largely the same as the original game but features a larger play area and different types of enemies. The player controls an astronaut that first has to collect all three parts of his rocket and then fully fuel it so that it can take off. The rocket parts are located on various platforms that the astronaut has to use his jetpack to reach. After the rocket has been fully assembled fuel will start falling from the sky and once enough of it has been collected the rocket will automatically ascend.

The game is entirely played with the mouse, using one button to thrust upwards and the other to shoot at the strange beings that fly around. Any contact with these will lead to a lost life and the game ends on the third. There is also a time limit for each level. By shooting the beings points are earned and bonuses are earned by collecting falling objects.</desc>

		<desc>Leeds United Champions! is a managerial soccer simulation in which the player takes control of Leeds United, the English champions of the 1991/92 season, in the fourth division; the goal being to conquer the Premier League in the long run. The game is completely menu based and the sub-menus are reached through a list of icons in the main menu. In those menus the player can set all the usual options of the genre, e.g. training, transfer market, lineup, ticket prices, youth section or stadium expansion. There is no match presentation to speak of; just a screen representing a live ticker which gives out the goals and bookings. Each athlete has 15 stats which influence his performance on the field.</desc>

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>

		<desc>Professor Mariarti is, as the game title suggests, a mad scientist. Not all of his experiments worked out the way they should and now he needs to shut down the power in five of his labs (the first four can be tackled in any order). This plays out as a standard platformer: Mariarti jumps over gaps between platforms and dodges enemies (he can take a few hits before dying) until he reaches the end of the level, i.e. the off switch.

At the start of the game he only throw wrenches to defend himself, but during the game he finds coins scattered around the labs. Those can be used to buy more advanced weapons like a laser cannon. However, killed enemies respawn after a short time. To proceed he also needs to solve a few puzzles by collecting items and bringing them to the correct place. There are also a number of switch puzzles.</desc>

As opposed to its predecessor, Super Fulcrum takes place in one big scenario instead of single missions. Your task is to represent the Soviet Union in a UN force sent to South America to defend a small country that is being threatened by a bigger and stronger neighbour. The game is relatively open-ended, allowing you to fulfill your missions in the way you see fit instead of monitoring your every step. All missions and their results are handled in your pilot's log.</desc>

		<desc>Moonquake is a A Bomberman clone written in 1992 for Acorn RISC OS computers. There are one and two player modes. The single player mode requires you to clear all the blockages over ten levels – each level includes more rambling robots and various reactors. Reactors can only be hit a limited number of times before exploding and wiping out the whole level, yourself included. The two player mode is a straightforward battle to the death.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Doo</name>
		<desc>Mr Doo is a variant of the arcade game Mr. Do! which makes some changes to the original design. The player controls a wizard who has to collect cherries and avoid various monsters. Unlike the arcade game the monsters do not chase the player but move in straight lines and only change direction upon reaching a block. The monsters can be killed by throwing a bouncing magic ball or by making apples fall onto them. The magic balls does not recharge in the version but instead the player starts out with five of them. Other differences include that the apples can not be pushed and that there are no letter monsters. There are some special tiles that add puzzle solving elements to the game. There are electric cables which kill the player on contact, bombs that detonate when triggered and sliders which push the wizard across the screen. The game can be customized and it is possible to turn off both the special tiles as well as the monsters and apples. There is also an option to play levels in normal, random or reversed order. In total the game contains 60 levels and a built-in editor can be used to modify them or to create new ones.</desc>

		<name>Nebulus</name>
		<desc>Nebulus (aka Tower Toppler) was ported to the Archimedes by Krisalis.

You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.
You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.
The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.
Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<desc>A fleet of space freighters carry a cargo of battle and security robots to help in the defence of Basmyth. Alien ships were bombarding the freighters with disorienting beams which drove the robots crazy. The human officers were eliminated, leaving the ships open for occupation by alien forces. At this point the players mission starts...

You control a cybernetic influence device (ID) which has been teleported aboard the first freighter to eliminate all the droids and robots. Two ways are possible to clean the ship decks representing the action part and the more strategy part of the game: Shooting (action) to destroy the robots or connecting itself into an other robot's brain (strategy) and take temporarily control of it.

It's possible to play the game as a simple shoot-em-up game, but the main part of Paradroid 90 is the transfer game to take control of other droids.</desc>

		<name>Pipemania</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

The game can be played using keyboard and/or analogue joystick. In 2 player mode joystick can only be selected by player 1.</desc>

		<desc>Poizone is a Pengo variant with an ecological theme. The player controls the penguin Zozo as he attempts to decontaminate each of the game's 50 levels. Like in Pengo each level contains blocks that can be pushed or destroyed. It differs though in that the main objective is not to kill the enemies but to destroy a number of toxic blocks. To complete a level 90% of these blocks have to be destroyed and it has to happen before time runs out.

There are eight kinds of toxic blocks and each has its own way to be destroyed. For example some blocks has to be destroyed from a specific direction while some has to be pushed away. Destroying a toxic block in the wrong way leads to a lost life. A life is also lost when making contact with a monster. Some other blocks exist such as power pills that can be used to avoid monsters and diamonds that give bonuses.</desc>

		<desc>Repton 3, released 5 November 1986, was developed by Matthew Atkinson at Superior's invitation since Tim Tyler wasn't interested in programming it—although he did design some of the levels for the new game. While the first two games had only taken a month each to program, Repton 3 took eight months.[1] It reverts to the form of a series of time-limited, password-protected levels. A few new features were introduced: fungus (a substance that gradually spreads wherever it finds space and kills Repton on contact), time capsules (resetting the current level's time limit each time one is collected), crowns and a timebomb which must be defused to complete each level. The inclusion of the timebomb means that, as well as collecting all of the diamonds and crowns, the user has to plan their route so as to finish up at the timebomb at the end of the level.</desc>

		<desc>SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new municipality, with the responsibility of building and maintaining a place where citizens can move to and work and be happy. The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.
Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, ...</desc>

		<name>Simon The Sorcerer</name>
		<desc>Simon is just an ordinary boy living in modern-day England. One day, his dog Chippy discovers a chest with a book inside, entitled Ye Olde Spellbooke. Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.

Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue.

Like in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</desc>

		<name>Simon The Sorcerer</name>
		<desc>Simon is just an ordinary boy living in modern-day England. One day, his dog Chippy discovers a chest with a book inside, entitled Ye Olde Spellbooke. Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.

Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue.

Like in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</desc>

		<name>Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.

You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.

The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.

You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.

A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.</desc>

		<desc>StarFighter 3000 is a space combat simulation featuring air-to-air and air-to-ground combat with over 50 varied missions spread across 4 levels.
There are enemy fighters, heat seeking missiles and space cruisers to deal with, not to mention enemy SAM sites and radar installations.
The laser can be used to destroy defences by targeting the ground they are on.
By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.
The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game is over, but the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.</desc>

		<name>Starch</name>
		<desc>Players play as two manual workers, Harry and Dave, on a frantic clothes-cleaning night shift. In addition to the two main characters the game also includes a computer controlled character called Sam that attempts to stop the progress of the main characters.
There are five different levels to complete, each consisting of a specific task. In order to complete a task the player has to work out how to operate various pieces of machinery controlled by buttons, levers and ropes.
Each level ends when the available time expires or a specific quota is met. Following the completion of each level the two characters are shown in the manager's office. If the level has been successfully completed then they jump up in the air in celebration. If the level has not been completed then the manager pulls a lever that opens a trap door, while uttering the words "you're fired!"

The game supports either one or two simultaneous players. In one player mode the second character is controlled by the computer.</desc>

Each robot's name indicates what their main function and purpose is, and these skills must be combined for success. Each section has its own task - collecting energy pods and destroying mines and bombs for example. The creatures which fill the towers must be avoided, or used to your advantage.

The game is viewed through a rotating camera with variable zoom, giving the game an advanced 3D feel for the day. A level designer has also been included.</desc>

		<name>Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition</name>
		<desc>A home computer version of the board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

Two game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

The question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art &amp; Literature, Science &amp; Nature, Geography, History, Sports &amp; Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music.

One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</desc>

		<desc>After the Cariken family became complacent, the land of Gaspar ceased to be ruled as well. This left the way clear for evil men such as Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. Only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces.

As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.

		<name>Warlocks</name>
		<desc>A platform shoot-em-up featuring a reincarnated knight who was tasked with freeing the world of Lylvania from the tyranny of 3 demented Warlocks.  The game set over ten large levels. The early levels are reasonably linear, but they soon become larger, requiring much exploration. Hidden rooms and caves can be found, containing extra lives, magical power-ups and level warps. Other features of this game are smooth parallax scrolling, thunder and lightning, rain, animating backdrops, stunning 256 colour graphics and great sound effects and music.

This game has been reviewed in:

Acorn Computing, Christmas Special December 1993 (with coverdisc demo)
Archimedes World, January 1994
Acorn User, February 1994
Acorn Action, Spring 1994

The game requires 1Mb of ram and RiscOS 2 or higher, but as it uses some minor video trickery, it will not work properly on VIDC2 machines without a software VIDC patch. It is compatible with the standard Acorn joysticks.

To enter the first hidden room, on level one after the second drop, walk left as far as you can and through the wall. This room continues past the water-fall, where you must stand on a chest and jump into the wall next to it to gain access to the third hidden part. When climbing the ladder out of the hidden room, walk into the far archway to be transported to the next level.

Many other hidden rooms are spread throughout the levels.

The levels are:

1 - The Forest
2 - The Graveyard
3 - The Waterfall
4 - The First Encounter
5 - The Giant Forest
6 - The Caves
7 - Skull Island
8 - The Volcano
9 - The Second Encounter
10 - The Castle</desc>

		<desc>In World Championship Boxing Manager the player can develop the careers of aspiring heavyweight boxers. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing the manager's office.

Training the boxers involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.</desc>

		<name>Zool - Ninja of the “Nth” Dimension</name>
		<desc>Zool (aka Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension) is a platform game ported to the Acorn Archimedes by James Byrne of Cygnus Software.

His name is Zool, and he is a gremlin-like creature from another dimension. He is forced to land on the Earth, but his sole goal is to attain the prestigious ranking of a Ninja. To do that, Zool will have to travel through six worlds, each divided into three stages, defeat his enemies, and prove himself worthy of that title.
Zool is a fast-paced side-scrolling platformer. The protagonist can run, jump, climb walls, and shoot enemies. Power-ups for Zool are scattered across the levels. These include life-spending hearts, smart bombs, shields, more powerful jump-skill and a twin Zool. This "twin" imitates the original's motions a few seconds after he performs them.

Zool was notable for the use of commercial product placement throughout the game's levels.</desc>

		<desc>Ballarena is a Breakout variant and as such the player's objective is to clear out all the blocks (which here come in many different shapes) on the screen with the use of a paddle that bounces a ball. What makes it different from other games of its kind is that the paddle is not only moved along the bottom of the screen but in a circle around the blocks located in the middle. There are no borders that stop the ball so it can leave the playing field on any side of the screen. When it has done so four times it is game over for the player. Clearing all blocks from the screen leads to progression to the next stage. Like in Arkanoid it's possible to pick up various power ups. These including giving bonus points, catching the ball with the paddle and a laser that can be used to blast blocks. The game also features various monsters that move around the screen and deflect the ball. They can be killed by hitting them with the paddle. Every fourth stage is a challenge stage where the game turns into a shoot 'em up similar to Gyruss. Monsters appear in the middle of the screen and the player uses his paddle to shoot them down as quickly as possible. The player then earns points based on number of shots and hits. The game can be played by one or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<name>Cascade</name>
		<desc>The water supply has been polluted by various nasty chemical compounds which have been placed there by evil aliens from Zygon 3 !! The only hope is to use the purification factories to remove the chemicals and make the water clean again. The aliens were not able to destroy these compounds but they have made accessing them hard by building huge structures over them and placing complicated puzzles inside these structures (the aliens have a very strange sense of humour and seem to find this funny). You must control a robot which can withstand the chemicals to a certain extent and direct the water to the exit pipe; from here it will flow into the purification plant and will be cleaned. You must do this within a certain time or the corrosive chemicals in the water will destroy your robot. When a level has been purified you will be able to move onto the next. You must purify all eight zones and there are five different structures in each zone.</desc>

		<desc>Sir Freddy is a sneaky and mean man who lives in a castle on an island. He turned green with envy when you built a better and stronger castle across the sea. He got a fleet of balloons so that he didn't get wet and then planned to bomb your castle with ease. What a cad to think of this wheeze! You in turn employed a gun crew to build a battlement with a good view to shoot down Sir Freddy in his balloon. To match your defensive intent, Sir Freddy phoned the Ship Shop and hired several Gun ships to shoot your cannon crew. You must defend your castle and shoot down the balloons and the invading ships.</desc>

		<desc>Thundermonk is an action puzzle game where the player controls The Lonesome Monk whose monastery has been overtaken by evil demons. The aim of the game is to move through the labyrinths of the monastery, collect treasures and use golden keys to unlock the Doors of Destiny. On each floor three goblets need to be collected. The monk is controlled from a side view which looks similar to a platform game but there is no jumping since the monk can levitate through the air. The monastery is full of strange objects that zaps the monk's energy when touched but these can be destroyed by throwing bombs. These bombs can be thrown through walls and at specific places it is also possible to walk through walls. Energy also decreases automatically with time and when throwing bombs which means the player can't take too long since a life is lost when energy runs out.</desc>

		<name>Zool - Ninja of the “Nth” Dimension</name>
		<desc>Zool (aka Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension) is a platform game ported to the Acorn Archimedes by James Byrne of Cygnus Software.

His name is Zool, and he is a gremlin-like creature from another dimension. He is forced to land on the Earth, but his sole goal is to attain the prestigious ranking of a Ninja. To do that, Zool will have to travel through six worlds, each divided into three stages, defeat his enemies, and prove himself worthy of that title.
Zool is a fast-paced side-scrolling platformer. The protagonist can run, jump, climb walls, and shoot enemies. Power-ups for Zool are scattered across the levels. These include life-spending hearts, smart bombs, shields, more powerful jump-skill and a twin Zool. This "twin" imitates the original's motions a few seconds after he performs them.

Zool was notable for the use of commercial product placement throughout the game's levels.</desc>
