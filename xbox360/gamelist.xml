		<name>Assassin's Creed</name>
		<desc>In the year 2012, a seemingly ordinary bartender named Desmond Miles is abducted by a mysterious organization. The captors attach Desmond to a strange device called "Animus", which allows him to access the memory of his ancestor, an assassin named Altaïr. For some reason, the reconstruction of Altaïr's memories is vital to the captors.

After accessing Altaïr's memory, Desmond is able to experience the events that took place in the Holy Land in the year 1191, the time of the Third Crusade. Al Mualim, the leader of the assassins, orders Altaïr to kill nine prominent historical figures, who supposedly let war and corruption take over the Holy Land.

During most of the game, the player controls Altaïr; however, it is clearly indicated that controlling him is a part of Desmond's experience. The player is also able to control Desmond between his sessions in the "Animus".</desc>

		<name>Backbreaker</name>
		<desc>Backbreaker is an American Football game in which the player controls an unlicensed team on its way to the top. The main selling point of the game it its graphics: it uses the Euphoria (physics) and Morpheme (animation) middleware engines, both developed by NaturalMotion, for real-time calculated player and especially tackling animations. The second big change in comparison to other football games are the controls: most actions are directly triggered with the right analogue stick instead of pressing buttons. The exception is the playing mode - aggressive or agile (offensive) respectively focus (defensive) - which is switched with the shoulder buttons and changes on what aspect the athlete focuses on, e.g. in aggressive defense mode a tackling will have more power behind them. The camera is positioned directly behind the active athlete and can't be controlled directly because it changes behaviour depending on the active mode.</desc>

		<desc>Baja: Edge of Control is an off-road racing game based on the real-life Baja 1000 race series held in California. The tracks are set in a desert environment and there's over 1000 miles of route to explore. In the main career mode, the idea is to start at the bottom class of off-road racing with a VW Beetle. By performing well in races, players earn prize &amp; sponsorship money and experience points to buy better machines and unlock higher classes. In order to secure the sponsorship money, their logos must still be on the car at the end of the race, so too much damage to the car will result in the player not getting paid. The vehicles can be tuned and modified to increase performance.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Brave [RF].iso</path>
		<name>Brave</name>
		<desc>Brave is an adventure game adaptation based on the film of the same name developed by Behaviour Interactive and published by Disney Interactive Studios. Actress Kelly Macdonald, who voiced Mérida in the film, reprised her role for the video game. This game was originally going to be published by THQ, but was published by Disney Interactive Studios instead. A port for the PlayStation Portable was also planned, but was cancelled for unknown reasons.

The storyline of the videogame matches that of the movie up until Elinor's transformation into a bear and subsequent escape from the castle, which is where the game begins.
Mérida chases her mother through the forest until she reaches the Ring of Stones. Will-o'-the-wisps appear to guide her to the cottage of the witch from whom she originally received the spell. Confronting the witch, Mérida demands her mother be changed back. The witch then explains that the cursed bear Mor'du has been corrupting a series of waystones with his evil energy, leading to the appearance of hostile creatures. The corruption has grown to the point that it even affects the witch's magic, making its effects unpredictable, thus explaining Elinor's newly-ursine form. Due to her status as the best archer in the kingdom, the witch charges Mérida with cleansing the waystones of Mor'du's corruption.
As Mérida journeys through the land, she encounters her younger identical triplet brothers (Harris, Hubert, and Hamish), also transformed into bears, and her mother, gradually losing her humanity as the spell stays in effect. After cleansing the last waystone in Mor'du's lair, Mérida and her mother come face-to-face with the beast himself, with the princess finally defeating him after a long and arduous battle.
With Mor'du's defeat, Elinor and the triplets are restored to their human forms. Mérida states that the journey was good for her because it taught her that she must strike a balance between her desire for adventure and her responsibilities as a princess.

The gameplay consists of single player and local co-operative play.[2] The first player controls Mérida while in co-op mode a second player can take control of a will-o'-the-wisp. Gameplay also features puzzles, which are to be solved with the help of the triplets, and Queen Elinor, who is playable in her bear form in arena fights. Different levels of the game can be accessed from the location called "Ring of Stones". Players can use different types of charms (fire, earth, air, and ice) to add elemental effects to her arrows and sword attacks when fighting enemies, some of which are vulnerable to a certain element.
The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game are compatible with the PlayStation Move and Kinect motion control peripherals, respectively. This feature comes in the form of an "archery range" mode.</desc>

		<desc>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a platforming action-adventure developed by Ninja Theory. In the game, the player controls Monkey in his escorting mission of Trip. Monkey is equipped with an extend-able staff which he uses in battle. As the name implies, Monkey has acrobatic skills like a monkey that he uses perfectly to climb on poles and escape from enemies. 

Combat is tied exclusively to Monkey's staff, delivering light or heavy blows and even shooting out plasma shots. While Trip does not help in the actual fighting, she can help in other ways like distracting the enemies or even unleashing a stunning EMP if she is attacked. Trip also uses a dragonfly camera that will scour the surrounding areas for mechs and mines. If any are found, they will show up on screen thanks to it being programmed into Monkey's headband. Tech-orbs found scattered throughout the levels are used for upgrading purposes.</desc>

Unlike the main series it is played from a third-person perspective. The visuals are changed to a cel shaded look with action words that appear on the screen similar to comic books. In this survival action game the player controls Cliff Calo who travels with two friends to the Banoi archipelago, mainly the Narapela island, to investigate the reports about strange events there. His main goal is to gather evidence by taking pictures with his camera, proving the Geopharm corporation is active on the islands. The game's tutorial is set slightly before the rest of the game where the player controls the operative Kilo Two who infiltrates a Geopharm facility to discover the identity of the mole, two days before the outbreak. Xian Mei, from the main game series, also appears as a character in the game.</desc>

		<name>Motogp '06</name>
		<desc>MotoGP 06 is the 2006 installment of THQ's motorcycle racing series, having all the season data accurate for the year.

Gameplay is of similar type to its predecessors, being very tight controls with gameplay that relies heavily on skill and not known for its forgivingness. The game includes 17 GP tracks as well as 17 faster, less technical (and also fictional) "Extreme" tracks. Some of the modes available are typical racing types, with Career, Stunt and Practice being a few.

The updates to the game in this particular case are refined controls, updated graphics to bring the game up to par with the capabilities of the 360, new bikes and racers and quite importantly a heavily re-worked and refined Live play mode, which supports up to 16 players in a race on either the "GP" or "Extreme" tracks.</desc>

The events are led at breakneck tracks in settings like Greece or Yosemite National Park. Unlike ones from another racing games, they are built from extreme turns (imagine 70 degree downhill and then three-way crossroad, leading to a hairpin turn), trampoline jumps hundreds of meters high and wide variety of ways to ride through.

In order to fit such hazardous environment, player has to upgrade his vehicle by installing better spare parts, unlocked after winning certain leagues. Each league consist of numerous events, either basic races or stunts challenges, where winner is decided by amount of points received by performing tricks (like perfect landing, jumping through rings in air and destroying opponents). Sometimes, so-called "mutators" are turned on, for example unlimited nitro.</desc>

		<desc>NASCAR '14 is the fourth NASCAR racing game to be created by development studio Eutechnyx. The game features 23 different tracks available as "day time tracks" with extra night versions tracks for Atlanta, Bristol, Charlotte, Daytona, Kansas, Kentucky and Texas. The player has the ability to create custom paint schemes for their car which can then be used in both Career mode and online. The game features a highlight mode where the player replays a past real life race event and must meet various criteria. The highlight game modes use real life telemetry data from NASCAR to determine the location of every car on the track, as such they are similar to "on rails" events where AI cars will always follow the same paths.

The game contains 43 licensed drivers and has a season mode where it is possible to play through a whole season of racing as the driver of your choice.</desc>

		<desc>NBA 2K16 is the 17th main game in the annual NBA 2K series of basketball games. It is based on the 2015-2016 NBA season and features all of its competing teams as well as classic teams (including twelve new ones such as the 1999–2000 Toronto Raptors) and 25 European teams competing in the Euroleague. The basic gameplay works like in previous iterations but with some changes both in presentation and gameplay. This include upgraded player models and new animations, more realistic ball and rim physics and player collisions. Changes in controls include dedicated buttons for lobs and bounce passes. In addition to playing individual exhibition matches there are numerous other game modes such as MyCareer, MyGM, MyLeague and MyTeam.nnnnThe MyCareer mode is called Livin' Da Dream and was developed in association with film maker Spike Lee. It is designed to be more story oriented and cinematic than previous games' career modes and sees the player taking control of a young basketball player from Harlem called Frequency Vibrations ("Freq"). Freq starts out in a small high school team but as the story progresses he will move first to a college team and later the NBA. The ultimate goal is to become one of the greatest players of all time. Before starting out it is possible to customize the appearance of the player and to choose a position and scoring style. Games in the career modes only involve controlling one player with the others being AI driven.</desc>

		<desc>NBA Live 10 is a simulation of the basketball sport. As usual the player controls the athletes himself and tries to perform typical basketball maneuvers with his gamepad. He can choose between playing a whole season, play-offs or the FIBA World Championship. In the Dynasty Mode the player takes the role of the executive of a basketball team which means he has to grapple with managerial tasks like transfers or training.

The most important feature of NBA Live 10 is the so-called "Dynamic DNA" which synchronizes the in-game statistics over the internet with the current data from the real league. In comparison to NBA Live 09 most new features are changes to the core game mechanics; especially the defense. Attempts to score now use just one button in combination with the analog sticks.</desc>

The gameplay is a mix of exploring and forensics. While exploring and looking for evidence is done in 3rd-person perspective, all the forensics mini-games draw inspiration from the techniques used in the CSI games.nnnnThe story is told through four episodes that use same video effects and a type of humor seen in the TV series. What seems to have started as a simple bank robbery escalates into dangerous terrorist conspiracy and a nuclear threat.</desc>

		<desc>NeverDead is a third-person shooter starring protagonist Bryce Boltzmann. He is a demon hunter of over 500 years old who was cursed with immortality after he witnessed the murder of his wife by the hands of demon king Astaroth. This event turned him into a raging alcoholic who spouts vulgarities. In the modern days where the game takes place, he hunts down demons for cash as a private investigator together with his cold, female partner Arcadia Maximille. The storyline follows the events when they investigate a demonic invasion that nearly destroyed a city.nnnnMuch of the game is built around the immortality, an unusual trait for a game character. Even though his physical appearance can be wounded or eviscerated, he can never completely be destroyed. While Bryce attacks hordes of enemies using a variety of firearms along with a sword, and dodges, blocks, and performs evasive maneuvers, his main worry is keeping his limbs together.</desc>

		<desc>Portal 2 is the sequel to Portal and offers the same first-person puzzle-platform gameplay. Players continue the story taking the role of the young woman Chell, who defeated the artificial intelligence computer system GLaDOS in the first game. After the events of the first game, she was placed in stasis until eventually woken up again. The sequel still takes place at Aperture Science Labs, but it is now overrun by decay and nature. Much more than in the first game, Chell moves past the clean test chambers and explores the gloomy industrial setting of the laboratory.

Just like in the first game, the gameplay is based around portals. By shooting a starting portal and ending portal at suitable surfaces, certain uncrossable gaps can be bridged. Just like in the first game, there are also many test chambers where puzzles need to be solved, using cubes, turrets, platforms and special portal tricks to gain a lot of speed.</desc>

		<name>Top Spin 3</name>
		<desc>The third game in the Top Spin series updates the concept of the previous two tennis titles with some new features. The most important change is that more control is given back to the player, levelling the difficulty. In the previous version the AI took control of timing and positing, players only needed to press a button for shots, and keeping it pressed longer made them harder. In this edition the player controls the power of the shot, the positioning of the player and the timing needed to perform a successful swing. When the player needs to run to reach the ball, it will never be as precise as powerful as when already in position. Most of these changes are gradually introduced in the tennis school, where players are trained to become familiar with the new controls.</desc>

However, Anon - the player's character - is much more athletic than a typical character for this genre, and the player is able to travel across The Grid using Anon's "free runner" aerobatic techniques. The player attacks hostile Programs primarily with their Light Disk, through either melee or ranged attacks. They can also use the disk to block the attacks of other Programs. Derezzing (in-universe slang for killing/deleting) a Program grants experience points, which can be used to upgrade the player's abilities. The game also includes sequences where the player can control Light Cycles (like TRON 2.0) and Tanks (upgraded versions of the ones from the first movie).</desc>

At character select, you can pick the version of the fighter from SF4, SSF4, SSF4AE, SSF4 AE Ver. 2012 and Ultra Street Fighter 4. This means, of course, that vanilla Sagat, who was nerfed by later versions of the game, can go up against the rebalanced characters from Ultra. "In all the years that I've been playing through the SF4 series, I can't count how many times discussions on 'who the strongest character has been thus far' have come up among players both old and new," Capcom's Peter Rosas, himself a former tournament player, wrote on Capcom Unity. "Seeing of how there was no actual way to measure whether vanilla SF4 Sagat was stronger than AE Yun, players would engage in long theoretical discussions with no way to figure out who was right. Well, time to change that in Ultra SF!"</desc>
