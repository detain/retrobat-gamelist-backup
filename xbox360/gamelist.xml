		<name>Assassin's Creed</name>
		<desc>In the year 2012, a seemingly ordinary bartender named Desmond Miles is abducted by a mysterious organization. The captors attach Desmond to a strange device called "Animus", which allows him to access the memory of his ancestor, an assassin named Altaïr. For some reason, the reconstruction of Altaïr's memories is vital to the captors.

After accessing Altaïr's memory, Desmond is able to experience the events that took place in the Holy Land in the year 1191, the time of the Third Crusade. Al Mualim, the leader of the assassins, orders Altaïr to kill nine prominent historical figures, who supposedly let war and corruption take over the Holy Land.

During most of the game, the player controls Altaïr; however, it is clearly indicated that controlling him is a part of Desmond's experience. The player is also able to control Desmond between his sessions in the "Animus".</desc>

No longer a cop, Max is close to washed-up, drunk and addicted to painkillers. Without a job on the force, Max has left the greater New York area, and finds himself in Sao Paulo, Brazil, working as private security. The story of Max's descent from vengeful, leather-jacket wearing detective roaming the alleys of New York to the broken, shaven-headed man out for justice on unfamiliar streets far from home is at the center of Max Payne 3. In addition to Max's classic shoot-dodge moves, there is now a combination of Natural Motion's Euphoria character behavior system and Bullet Time to enhance his moves. Partners and sidekicks will play a large role in this game to help Max in his quest for vengeance.</desc>

		<name>WWE 2K15</name>
		<desc>WWE 2K15 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts, and is published by 2K Sports for the PlayStation 3 (PS3), PlayStation 4 (PS4), Xbox 360, Xbox One and Windows PC. It was succeeded by WWE 2K16. It was released on October 28, 2014 in North America and on October 31, 2014 in Europe for last generation consoles and released on November 18, 2014 in North America and on November 21, 2014 in Europe for current generation consoles. It was released on PC on April 28, 2015 and was the first WWE game to be released on the platform since WWE RAW, which was released in 2002. WWE 2K15 is also the first 2K WWE game to be released on PC.[2][3] The cover features John Cena and is the first in the series to use the new WWE logo introduced in late 2014.

The game is based on the professional wrestling promotion WWE and WWE 2K15 serves as the first game in the series to signify the "new generation", placing a heavy emphasis on traditional and more relaxed gameplay, unlike the arcade-like combat prominent in previous installments. WWE 2K15 adds several new features to compliment main theme based around naturalism, adding a new chain grapple system at the beginning of matches, slowing the pacing of the matches and adding a new stamina bar to reflect and portray the quality of matches produced on WWE television in the game.</desc>

		<desc>In YAIBA: NINJA GAIDEN Z, players will battle fierce zombies as Yaiba, a cyborg ninja who will do anything to get revenge and stay alive. Cleaved in two, he is brought back to life with cyber technology. Brandishing his ninja sword and the mecha weapons in his cyborg arm, he slaughters zombies with brutal, over the top abandon. Step into a stylized living comic book where stunning graphics depict a world gone mad. Hordes of undead can only be stopped by Yaiba's willingness to use any means necessary to get the job done. Will he kill by turning his cyborg arm into a razor chainsaw for slicing up undead or just rip off an opponent's arms to use as zombie nun chucks. Both possibilities fill Yaiba's heart with twisted laughter in this upcoming collaboration between famed developers Team NINJA and concept's Keiji Inafune.</desc>

		<name>Asterix at the Olympic Games</name>
		<desc>Lovestorix is in love with Princess Irina but Brutus also wants to marry her. To solve this problem, the Princess decides that she'll marry whoever wins the Olympic Games. At the same time the evil Doctormabus has discovered a dimensional key with which he can open portals to parallel dimensions and with it threatens to destroy the balance between the worlds. But of course Asterix &amp; Obelix come to the rescue and have to not only stop Doctormabus but also help Lovestorix win the games.

Like in Astérix &amp; Obélix XXL 2: Mission: Las Vegum you take control over both Asterix and Obelix and fight your way through hordes of Romans, building up combos with your punches and solving small riddles on the way. You can also change between controling Asterix or Obelix at any time. But since you are taking part in the Olympic Games, there are also several mini-games waiting which need to be beat in order to progress further in the story. These mini-games include things like Long Jump or Tug of War. These field events are played much like in Asterix and Obelix which means for example that you alternate between two buttons as fast as you can to run.

Once you've completed an event in the story mode, you can also play these events seperately in Olympic Mode in which two players (or one player against the CPU) fight for the gold medal in each discipline.

During the story mode you also collect helmets by destroying scenery objects or beating up Romans. These can be used to buy health or new combos ingame or unlock small parts of the movie. You also unlock new characters for the Olympic Mode as you advance in the story.

Also the game neither directly follows the storyline of the comic nor the movie, the twist with the portals to the real world is used to also include some actors of the movie in the game.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Backbreaker [PAL][NTSCU].iso</path>
		<name>Backbreaker</name>
		<desc>Backbreaker is an American football video game, developed by British technology developer NaturalMotion, and released on 1 June 2010 in North America and on 25 June 2010 in Europe. One of its highlights is the use of Euphoria, a game animation engine that determines animations dynamically rather than depending on canned animations. Backbreaker does not use teams from the National Football League (NFL) because Electronic Arts has an exclusive license to produce NFL games in its Madden series. The game relies on an extensive logo editor and team builder that was called "one of its silver linings". NaturalMotion announced Backbreaker in August 2007, with a targeted release date of late 2008. The game ended up being delayed until mid-2010.

Backbreaker received mixed reviews. While it was praised for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it was also criticized for its weak online play, poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. After the reviews, the passing game was adjusted by the greathouse patch. The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator Metacritic, while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%. The iOS and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade. A patch released on 6 August 2010, alleviated many of the issues critics had with the game upon release and included upgrades such as: improved AI, new play books and an enhanced replay feature.[1]</desc>

		<name>Backyard Sports: Sandlot Sluggers</name>
		<desc>Backyard Sports is a series of video games released for both consoles and computers. The series is best known for starring kid-sized versions of popular professional sports stars, such as Albert Pujols, Paul Pierce, Barry Bonds, Tim Duncan, Clint Mathis, Kevin Garnett, Tom Brady, Alex Rodriguez, Joe Thornton and Andy Macdonald. The Backyard Sports series is licensed by the leading professional US sports leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLS).

The series includes Backyard Baseball, Backyard Basketball, Backyard Football (American football), Backyard Soccer, Backyard Hockey (Ice hockey), and Backyard Skateboarding. In the games, players form a team consisting of Backyard Kids and pro players, which they take through a "Backyard League" season, attempting to become the champions. Players can create their own athletes, starting in Backyard Football (1999). Another aspect of the games is the use of Power-Ups, allowing players to gain "super-abilities." For instance, "Super Dunk" allows a basketball player to make an incredible dunk from nearly anywhere on the court, "Leap Frog" allows a football player to jump over the entire defensive line, and "Ice Cream Truck" causes the other team to be completely distracted for a brief period of time.

Some of these games are playable with the ScummVM emulator.[1]</desc>

		<desc>One day the player's character meets Dan Kuso, one of the Battle Brawlers, who teaches him the rules in a fight against Shuji. (you get a Serpenoid, a Juggernoid, and a Saurus that match the attribute you chose at the start of the game). After going to the local store and meeting Alice, who suggests the player should battle with other brawlers in the park to earn BP (Bakugan Points, the game's currency) a strange Bakugan called Leonidas falls from the sky, who is now the new best friend of the player. (Leonidas' attribute depends on what attribute you chose). Leonidas is an unknown and aggressive Bakugan that was created by all the hate and anger of the lost Bakugan trapped in the Doom Dimension. In several fights the player will meet a lot of people but at the same time a Darkus user, whose name is Marduk, decides to rule over all Bakugan together with Vladitor, another Bakugan that suddenly appears.

Right after Naga got the Silent Core, the seals that held Vladitor captive in the Doom Dimension suddenly broke and he escaped from the Doom Dimension. At the end of a tournament when Dan makes the player an official Bakugan Battle Brawler, Marduk is revealed to have allied with Hal G, Masquerade and Naga in order to defeat the Battle Brawlers and rule over the worlds and the Bakugan. The player must win the Ultimate Battle Tournament, defeating also Dan, Runo, Marucho, Julie, Shun, Masquerade, and a 1-on-1 showdown with Omega Leonidas and Battle Axe Vladitor. After the player wins, both Vladitor and Leonidas disappear, saying they have only little power left after the brawl. Later, the player discovers that Vladitor gave Leonidas his remaining power, saying he deserved it, leaving Leonidas to assume that Vladitor "wasn't all bad". The game ends with the player throwing Leonidas in the air shouting, "Bakugan brawl!".</desc>

		<name>Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts</name>
		<desc>Famed game developer Rare is reviving one of its most beloved and successful franchises exclusively on Xbox 360 with the third installment of the Banjo-Kazooie series. Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts embraces new and old fans alike, as the famous bear and bird duo return in stunning high definition for a unique adventure of epic proportions. The Lord of the Games (aka LOG) is tired of the petty squabbling between Banjo and the evil witch Gruntilda (aka Grunty) over the years, and has arranged a showdown to decide the rightful owner of Spiral Mountain. Claiming to have created every video game ever made, LOG has built the game worlds in which the contest's challenges take place. Banjo must complete LOG's challenges to win, while Grunty tries to stop him using every method her devious mind can muster. 

Throughout their adventure, players create their own abilities by building vehicles for Banjo to pilot over land, water, and air. Vehicle parts, which range from simple devices such as engines and wheels to more unusual equipment such as springs and egg guns, are earned and collected throughout the game. Players use their imagination to combine parts in any order to create whatever vehicle they choose. LOG's challenges have one goal, but players' choice of vehicle and tactics will determine how they get there. By exploring worlds and solving puzzles, players both young and old will be rewarded with more advanced and diverse vehicle parts in their quest to defeat Grunty once and for all.</desc>

		<name>Battle Fantasia</name>
		<desc>There was once a time when the world was engulfed in darkness. Mankind fought six battles to save their world, but lost every single one. All hope was lost for humanity, but one day the darkness was finally driven back by the swords of four heroes. Light returned to the world, and with it came peace and serenity. The world was then divided into two major countries: The Magic Kingdom and the Steam Empire. The people prospered like never before. But in recent months, rumors spread among the people that the darkness was returning. However, fate has once again brought together warriors from all over the world. 

From the makers of the Guilty Gear series of fighting games comes Battle Fantasia, a 2D fighter with lively 3D backgrounds, cel-shaded graphics, and fantasy-themed characters. In addition to traditional Arcade, Versus, Time Attack, and Practice modes, Battle Fantasia also features a Story mode that provides RPG-style dialogue and detailed information about the lives of each of the ten main fighters. Gamers must learn to master counterattacks and the energy-gauge depleting Heat mode in order to advance through scenarios and unlock hidden illustrations, but those simply looking for a quick battle can also head online for head-to-head matches against a friend.</desc>

		<name>Battlefield: Bad Company 2</name>
		<desc>In Battlefield: Bad Company 2, the Bad Company crew again find themselves in the heart of the action, where they must use every weapon and vehicle at their disposal to survive. The action unfolds with unprecedented intensity, introducing a level of fervor to vehicular warfare never before experienced in a modern warfare action game.
The 'B' company fight their way through snowy mountaintops, dense jungles and dusty villages. With a heavy arsenal of deadly weapons and a slew of vehicles to aid them, the crew set off on their mission and they are ready to blow up, shoot down, blast through, wipe out and utterly destroy anything that gets in their way. Total destruction is the name of the game -- either online or offline, enemies will soon learn there is nowhere to hide.</desc>

Set in the Pacific during World War II, it is a hybrid of action and real-time tactics as the player can both command his fleet assets and assume control of any one of them at will. The single player campaign is a series of missions from Pearl Harbor commanding an Elco PT Boat to the Battle of Midway commanding an entire Carrier Battle Group.</desc>

		<name>Battlestations: Pacific</name>
		<desc>Battlestations: Pacific is the successor to Battlestations: Midway and once again pits Japanese against Americans. Two single-player campaigns await the player with one picturing the Japanese starting at the attack on Pearl Harbor and the American campaign following the aftermath of the the Battle for Midway.

Similar to the Battlefield series the game puts the player right in the middle of the battle, always surrounded by AI-units filling up the free spots. But instead of fighting on foot, the players only use several different kinds of battleships, u-boats and airplanes. These are launched by the players at their team's HQ and can be equipped with different weapon load-outs. Depending e.g. on the type of the airplane (bomber, fighter or such), these range from MGs over rockets and bombs to carpet bombs and paratroopers. Of course once the support bar reaches zero, no more units can be launched.

Besides players doing all the work while sitting in a unit, the commander can also use the tactical map to assign formations, give out orders to the AI as well as other players and so on. This is also the place where the players choose in which unit they want to jump in. Each type of unit also plays radically different. While airplanes concentrate on fast dogfights and low bomb-droppings, ships are slow but can repair themselves. U-Boats on the other hand have the ability to dive and disappear from every enemies radar. To compensate for that, U-Boats not only have a limited supply of oxygen but can also be spotted by sonar and killed with water-bombs.

Besides the campaigns, the game also features five skirmish-modes for both single- and multiplayer. In "Escort" both teams have to defend key units from the enemy while themselves attacking and destroying the enemies key units with every player using a pre-defined unit. "Siege" on the other hand one team has to attack a island or coastline with the other team defending it. This time each player can choose his own unit from an available pool of units. "Competition" again has all the players only controlling one unit but fight on the same side in an effort to destroy as many AI-enemies as possible or completing the objectives. In "Duel" the players choose their unit before each mission and have to destroy all enemy units to win the round. And last but not least "Island Conquest" requires the capturing of control points to both win the match and gain access to additional units.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Bayonetta [RF].iso</path>
		<name>Bayonetta</name>
		<desc>Bayonetta is a stylish and cinematic action game, directed by Devil May Cry creator Hideki Kamiya. A member of an ancient witch clan and possessing powers beyond the comprehension of mere mortals, Bayonetta faces-off against countless angelic enemies, many reaching epic proportions, in a game of 100% pure, unadulterated all-out action. Outlandish finishing moves are performed with balletic grace as Bayonetta flows from one fight to another. With magnificent over-the-top action taking place in stages that are a veritable theme park of exciting attractions, Bayonetta pushes the limits of the action genre, bringing to life its fast-paced, dynamic climax combat. 

Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint. 

In addition to the weaponry on her hands and feet, Bayonetta also has gruesome devices in her arsenal, such as the Iron Maiden and Guillotine. Charge her Magic gauge to send enemies packing. Even her hair is designed for devastation, serving as a magical conduit to summon demonic beasts for aid in battle. And, with the ability to transform into panthers, bats and other forms, she's prepared to handle any situation. When it comes to banishing sinister supernatural forces, Bayonetta's the best man for the job.</desc>

While in previous games the Olympics were usually just a set of events, in Beijing 2008 they are much more complex, and feature a game where the player must complete a number of challenges each day with the difficulty level and number of necessary successes increasing progressively. While in the other modes there is a slight slowdown during the technical parts of the events, in Olympic the player must assign points to it, and trigger when required. The player also needs to assign points to other key areas, such as speed, technique or accuracy. Failing to reach the goal for the day forces the player to load the game and try again.</desc>

		<name>Binary Domain</name>
		<desc>Binary Domain is an original squad-based shooter by Toshihiro Nagoshi, the creator behind some of Sega's most well-known video game franchises, including the critically acclaimed Yakuza series. Campaign play in Binary Domain features a trust based system in which the maintenance of relationships developed with AI squadmates are crucial if they are to follow orders. The game also features full destructible robot enemies, a wide range of weapons and a robust range of online multiplayer options. 

Binary Domain puts players in the middle of a fast paced and intense battle for humanity against androids called the "Hallow Children" in 2080 Tokyo. Fighting through the derelict lower levels of the city, players control an international peacekeeping squad that soon starts to question their surroundings and the choices they make, especially as they realize that the androids appear to think that they are human and they witness the dramatic divisions within society. In the face of this struggle the question becomes, are these these robots becoming more human, or are humans becoming more like machines? 

Players assume the role of Dan Marshall, the leader of a multinational squad of commandos known as the "Rust Crew." The different characters of the squad each have different skills and personalities which must be exploited. Players are always Dan, but also command all other squad members, communicating with them either through a headset or via their controller. As players progress through the game they build dynamic relationships with AI squadmates based on the overarching cause and effect component of the game known as the Consequence system. Within the Consequence system, the player's actions determine the amount of trust each squadmate has in Dan. The Consequence system also affects the way that the campaign of the story plays out, with the use of different characters in different situations influencing events and outcomes.</desc>

		<desc>Bionic Commando is an action-adventure game, in which the player controls player-character Nathan Spencer. The game uses several mechanics (primarily radiation) which act as barriers. These barriers are used to keep the players within the confines of the linear level design. Nathan Spencer is able to target enemies while hanging, climbing a building or even in mid-swing, while using an implement called the Bionic Arm which can also be used to attack enemies at close range. The bionic arm can be used to grab and launch objects such as boulders and cars at enemies. In addition, he is equipped with boots that enable him to kick said objects at enemies. These boots are also the reason Spencer does not take damage from extremely long falls.</desc>

These heroes wear Toa Masks of Power - powerups you can find throughout the levels to gain different elemental based abilities. You'll also find Bionicle cannisters to help aid your quest to defeat Vezon - the 7th Piraka who had stolen the Mask of Life.

Gameplay centers around firefights against the alien "robots" called Vahki, Visorak and Borhok. Players will collect Lego pieces for every enemy you defeat, and eventually enable an invulnerable Hero Mode to help defeat the Toa's enemies.</desc>

Set in present day, players take the role of a decorated military veteran charged by the government to lead a squadron of "secret soldiers," each with his/her own specialty skill set, into the Rachel, Nevada area to fight off the invasion of unidentified enemy races. The player's modern-day emotions and fears are driven into a world charged with grave responsibility affecting lives hanging in the balance and eventually finding himself torn between his professional orders and his own ethical standards. In the end, only the actions of the player and his squad can shape the outcome of BlackSite: Area 51 during this potentially pivotal moment in history.</desc>

		<name>Blades of Time</name>
		<desc>Blades of Time is the spiritual sequel to X-Blades by the same developer. It again follows the story of Ayumi but does not pick up on the events of the previous game. She is a female treasure hunter who disrupts a rite of a guild to access a sphere that transports her to the fantasy world Dragonland. She fights with a set of blades in over-the-top hack-and-slash gameplay reminiscent of the God of War series. Slashes and kicks are linked into fast combos including finishing moves when an enemy has been forced into a submissive position. She can also pick up a variety of long-ranged weapons such as rifles or a rocket launcher and these are also used to shoot objects that are out of reach to solve puzzles. During her journey she can pick up diary pages from previous treasure hunters that explain how chaos magic has altered the environment and introduced monsters. She also meets fellow treasure hunters along the way.

Ayumi regularly discovers altars where new skills are learned. This includes for instance the ability to freeze enemies or rise giant ice crystals below them. These can only be used when a rage bar is built up with up to three levels by defeating opponents. She is also able to dash away to evade attacks or quickly close the distance towards an opponent. In a menu Ayumi can equip the items and weapons she finds. There are four slots: close combat, ranged attacks, amulets, and rings. Previously found items are not dumped and it is possible to switch between items at any moment when a certain effect is needed such as additional fire damage. Certain items can be crafted by discovering a recipe and collecting the necessary ingredients. Time referenced in the title refers to the skill Ayumi eventually learns to rewind time and fight along with a clone of herself that performs the actions that were previously done. This self-cooperative element is a way to confuse enemies carrying shield and is also vital to solve some of the puzzles in the later parts of the game. There is no in-game map but a compass can be pulled out with a visual effect for the direction that should be followed. After defeating a boss character there is often a portal that leads to a new location.

Multiplayer is available through the Outbreak mode with gameplay similar to Defense of the Ancients. It offers games where two teams attempt to defeat each other's energy tree while keeping their own alive. Between the two trees are outposts filled with computer-controlled minions and monsters. At the start of the game each player selects up to three abilities. The tree keeps regenerating energy until all outposts have been destroyed and it is enhanced by destroying enemy outposts and player-controlled heroes. Each outpost spawns characters that move towards the opponent and his outposts. By defeating heroes and outposts players earn additional respawns and open up further room for abilities. When all outposts have been destroyed respawns directly tap from the tree energy's source until eventually there is no energy left and death becomes permanent. The game also introduces boss monsters and special chests that contain a berserk charge for the heroes. Level imbalance is also detected with the introduction of Skyguard to give the losing team a chance to gain experience and move up levels. Item crafting is carried over to multiplayer, but time rewinding is not possible.</desc>

		<desc>Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War is a historical real-time tactics video game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. It was published by Koei and developed by Omega Force. The game is loosely based on the Hundred Years' War between the Kingdoms of England and France in the 14th and 15th centuries. Just like the Kessen and Musou series from Koei, certain liberties are taken from the original history. For example, unlike what happened in real life, it is possible to save Joan of Arc from being burned at the stake. A expansion remake, entitled Bladestorm: Nightmare was released for consoles in Japan at the end of January, 2015 and in western regions a couple months later. The worldwide Microsoft Windows release was on May 29, 2015.[</desc>

		<name>BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger</name>
		<desc>BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is a 2D fighting game by Arc System Works, the studio that created the distinctive Guilty Gear series. As the developer's first 2D fighter developed for high-definition systems, BlazBlue features fast, anime-inspired fighting action, which plays out over detailed, multi-layered backgrounds, with flashy, sometimes psychedelic visual effects for special attacks and big hits. The fighting takes on a certain rhythm, as there is a split second pause after each hit, giving players who can catch on to the cadence a chance to use the brief freezes to time their next move or counterattack. The action is very fast, and without the stuttering pauses, few humans could hope to keep up. Each character has a special "drive" attack move, which is difficult to perform, but devastating if used correctly. The story of the game involves dissent and destruction among a powerful council, known unofficially as "the Library," which controls a great power that once saved humanity, but which now wields its power in protective, some say repressive, ways. The game's developer declared BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger to be the "spiritual successor" to the Guilty Gear series. Its roster of combatants is a rogue's gallery of weird, super-powered, emotionally complicated characters, including vampires and werewolves, and the beat-'em-up action plays out to an unrelenting precision-metal soundtrack by composer Daisuke Ishiwatari.</desc>

		<desc>You can take to the skies and reenact some of the greatest air battles of World War II in Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII. The game features squadron-based combat, which lets you use the individual characteristics of your wingmen to complete the 18-mission single-player campaign. Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII uses the graphical power of the Xbox 360 to accurately model battle sites--such as England, Morocco, and Pearl Harbor--and the 38 aircraft included in the game. Up to 16 players can battle via Xbox Live in both competitive and cooperative game modes.</desc>

		<name>Blur</name>
		<desc>Blur is the ultimate powered-up racing experience, dropping you into electrified action with a mass of cars targeting the finish line and battling each other as they trade paint in both single player and multiplayer action. Travel the globe from LA and San Francisco to Spain, the UK and more to take on the best the streets have to offer. Utilize an arsenal of power-ups like nitro speed boosts, shock attacks, defensive shields, and landmines to beat your rivals across the finish line. You choose how and when to use your arsenal of power-ups for ultimate impact in a race where the outcome is never certain. 

In Blur the storyline plays out in the single player campaign. Here players assume the role of an up-and-coming racer who is looking to make a name for himself in the underground racing scene, but the competition is fierce. As you take on the series of races, you'll meet a bunch of recurring characters. Some of these characters will be rivals, others perhaps will act as mentors, and some may be something else entirely. The only thing that is certain in the world of Blur is that in a race there are winners and losers, and racers will do anything to reach the finish line first.</desc>

In this RPG where all your choices lead to consequences, you will have to choose between unleashing the powers of the beast within and rejecting the demonic influence that wants to claim your humanity.

Freely develop your abilities and combat style through three skill trees: swing the heavy weapons of the Fighter, wield the sneaky dual daggers of the Ranger, or use the devastating flame spells of the Pyromancer.

Recruit companions who will live, love, hate and fight alongside you against the dreadful creatures of Vertiel, in real-time epic battles based on tactics and reaction.

The bigger the danger, the greater the temptation to draw on the demon’s power at the cost of your soul… which way will YOU choose?</desc>

		<name>Bullet Witch</name>
		<desc>At first, we thought she was one of them - a woman in black, with a long gun like a witch's broom and the magical powers to match. Survivors whispered her stories in the alleyways: stories of battles so intense that they leveled whole city blocks, during which she mowed down entire demon regiments with flaming bullets, then shared her own blood to save the wounded. They say she can summon clouds of ravens, call up thorns from the ground, and even conjure up lightning and tornadoes at will. 

Maybe she flew down from Heaven. Maybe Hell spat her back out. Either way, she's all we've got. 

Bullet Witch is set on a bleak Earth, in the year 2013. The human race is almost extinct as hideous demons and monsters dominate the planet. It's been decided that only a combination of ancient and modern combat can beat the creatures. Alicia is a highly-trained soldier who also knows ancient magic. The fate of the human race is in her hands as she ventures into the world of monsters and fights them with her mix of magical arts and military equipment. Manage Alicia's health &amp; magic meters to avoid running out of ammo or power - be strategic &amp; play it safe, or the world dies with her.</desc>

But deception within the ranks has caused two members of the most feared unit to strike out on their own.

They survive on two objectives: get off the planet alive and extract revenge on the man who sent them there.

		<desc>This time it's not about winning. It's not about riding on dubs or gaudy neon lights. It's about an utter disregard for the rules of road and total domination. This time it's personal. This time it's about revenge. The sequel to 2004's racing game of the year, Burnout Revenge straps gamers into the fastest, most dangerous racer on the road. Fight dirty or go down in flames - the only rule is complete automotive anarchy. 

Built for unprecedented destruction, Burnout Revenge challenges gamers to exact their revenge on rush hour traffic, vindictive rival racers and anything else that gets between them and the finish line. 

Featuring multi-level tracks designed for fighting, wicked vertical takedowns, explosive new crashbreakers, new gameplay modes and wide open "crash courses" for epic crash sequences that put Hollywood to shame, Burnout Revenge redefines speed and aggression for the ultimate in vehicular combat. 

And when gamers are ready to take their rage on the road, a massive suite of online modes and features open up endless possibilities to slam, shunt and stonewall new enemies all over the world. Happy hunting!</desc>

		<desc>Xbox 360 players can experience the full adventure of Blizzard’s epic action RPG, Diablo III, as the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition includes the expansion pack Reaper of Souls! Bringing the world of Diablo back to Xboxgamers, this edition of Diablo III features special four-player co-op features. With the wireless controller and a custom-designed console interface, players will be outfitted with touch pad functionality and new social features as they engage in pulse-pounding combat with hordes of monsters and acquire items of incredible power.

Diablo III picks up the story twenty years after the events of Diablo II. Mephisto, Diablo, and Baal have been defeated, but the Worldstone, which once shielded the inhabitants of the world of Sanctuary from the forces of both Heaven and Hell, has been destroyed, and evil once again stirs in Tristram. Take on the role of one of six powerful character classes -- Barbarian, Demon Hunter, Monk, Witch Doctor, Wizard, or the all-new Crusader -- and embark on a dark journey through Acts I-V to save the world of Sanctuary from ancient and sinister forces. Players will acquire powerful items, spells, and abilities as they explore new and familiar areas of Sanctuary and battle hordes of demons to safeguard the world from the horrors that have arisen.</desc>

The truth behind your betrayal is as murky as the waters surrounding the city, and the life you once had is gone forever.</desc>

		<name>DoDonPachi Resurrection: Deluxe Edition</name>
		<desc>After the turmoil caused by the assault on Lunapolis which sparked the "Blissful Death Wars" (as depicted in DoDonPachi Dai-Ou-Jou), peace seems to have been restored, with the legendary DonPachi Corps retreating to its HQ in a space-time fold. Six years later, anomalies are detected in the space-time fabric, yet tests reveal nothing out of order, with the portals regularly functioning for both teleportation and time travel; also, the leader of the DonPachi squadron Colonel Godwin Longhener dismisses the matter due to the lack of actual danger.

Nevertheless, a technician delves deeper into the anomaly, discovering that something has infiltrated the HQ computer systems and is using the portals to send large quantities of materials and data to the past, spreading out like a virus and quickly evolving. In an ironic twist, the virus is discovered to be the program originally installed in the Element Dolls six years ago, now reaching beyond the DonPachi Corps programming and seeking to annihilate the human race in retaliation for their "enslavement" (after the war, they met a rather cruel demise at the hand of their own human creators) by waging war in the past rather than in the present: unsettled, the Colonel authorizes the last transport ship to time jump in order to fight back the invasion before future changes. However, he states: "Start over from the past... I never thought of that", echoing the ideas of mankind's imperfection which has always been a recurring theme in the series.

And once again, the three pilots jump back in time to 2008 and enter the fray, the transport ship being targeted as soon as it exits the portal: the Element Daughters, gigantic evolutions of the Dolls, are awaiting...

The bee is still humming.</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Ball: Raging Blast (??????? ????????? Doragon B?ru Reijingu Burasuto?) is a video game based on the manga and anime franchise Dragon Ball. It was developed by Spike and published by Namco Bandai for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 game consoles throughout North America, while everywhere else it would be published under the Bandai label. It was released in Japan, North America, Europe, and Australia during the second week of November 2009. In Europe, a limited edition pack of the game was also released that included bonus collector material.
The game is a cel-shaded 3D fighter that allows players to play as characters within the Dragon Ball universe, either against the game's AI or another player in one of the various modes of play both on and offline. The game is one of the first games in the Dragon Ball franchise to be published by Namco Bandai in North America, as the company would acquire the gaming license from previous license holder Atari in July of that same year.
The game was met with mixed to negative reviews from gaming critics for its storymode and overall gameplay controls.</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi is a game based on the manga and anime franchise Dragon Ball Z, and it is the fourth installment of the Budokai Tenkaichi series. The game is a 3D fighter that features various characters from the Dragon Ball Z franchise. Players can select from among 28 characters or create their own custom character to fight against the AI, or with another player locally or online.

The game has several modes of play. The Story mode follows the plot of the anime including several of the movies and recreates many of the series' iconic battles. Most of the battles are standard one-on-one fights, but there are some special boss fights that feature giant characters like Great Ape Vegeta and Janemba. The Hero mode is similar to the Story mode in gameplay, but it features a new story centered around the player's custom character. Finally, there is the Tournament mode in which up to 16 characters can participate in a standard single-elimination tournament.</desc>

		<desc>Put on your shades and prepare to step into the boots of Duke Nukem, whose legend has reached epic proportions in the years since his last adventure. The alien hordes are invading and only Duke can save the world. Pig cops, alien shrink rays and enormous alien bosses can't stop our hero from accomplishing his goal: to save the world, save the babes and to be a bad-ass while doing it. The King arrives with an arsenal of over-the-top weapons, non-stop action, and unprecedented levels of interactivity. This game puts the pedal to the metal and tongue firmly in cheek. Shoot hoops, lift weights, read adult magazines, draw crude messages on whiteboards or ogle the many hot women that occupy Duke's life - that is if you can pull yourself away from destroying alien invaders. With hours and hours of over-the-top single player action, and a range of bodacious multiplayer modes, rest assured knowing the fun will last. Duke Nukem was and will forever be a gaming icon, and this is his legend.</desc>

		<name>Earth Defense Force 2017</name>
		<desc>Earth Defense Force 2017, known in Japan as Chiky? B?eigun 3, is a third-person shooter developed by Sandlot, and published by D3 Publisher, for the Xbox 360. It is the follow-up to Global Defence Force, and is the first game in the Earth Defense Force series (as well as the first game based on D3's Simple series of budget games) to be released in North America. Earth Defense Force 3 was the best selling Games on Demand game in Japan for 2009. The game was released on the PlayStation Vita in Japan on 27 September 2012. It was released digital-only in North America on January 8, 2013 and in the PAL region on January 16, 2013.

The player takes control of an EDF soldier who is part of the elite unit Storm 1. To fight these alien forces the player can access over 150 weapons in the game, ranging from assault rifles and sniper rifles to rocket launchers, grenades and laser weapons. Only two weapons may be selected for each mission. Some levels also contain vehicles which can be commandeered; a tank, a helicopter, a hoverbike and a bipedal mecha are available. The game takes place across 53 levels featuring destructible environments, taking place in settings such as cities and caves. There is no penalty for collateral damage that is inflicted on the environment by the player, for instance buildings will crumble after sustaining a single hit from a rocket launcher or grenade. Other EDF soldiers can be recruited or followed, and attack enemies on sight, as well as provide radio chatter.

There are five difficulty levels. More effective weapons are dropped by the enemies in the game at the higher difficulty levels, encouraging players to repeat the missions. In addition to weapons, armor enhancements which function as permanent maximum health bonuses are dropped along with healing items.</desc>

		<name>Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard</name>
		<desc>Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard is a third-person shooter video game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 video game consoles. The game was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and published by D3 Publisher.

Eat Lead pits players in the role of the title character, a "legendary" gaming hero who is "returning to glory" in a new video game, some 25 years after his debut game and 6 years after his last game. In reality, the Matt Hazard character is in his first video game, with a history made up by D3 Publisher to chronicle the character's rise and fall in popularity. The Return of Matt Hazard marks Hazard's fictitious "comeback" to the gaming scene. Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace "Wally" Wellesley.

The game itself is a parody of action-gaming clichés. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard's successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles.[1]

The cast of Eat Lead received a nomination in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, under the category for "Best Cast"</desc>

		<desc>Enemy Territory: Quake Wars is a first-person shooter video game developed by Splash Damage and published by Activision for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[12] The prequel to Quake II, Quake Wars is set in the same science fiction universe as Quake II and Quake 4, with a minimal back-story serving as a prequel to Quake II. It is the second multiplayer-focused game in the Quake series after Quake III Arena.

Quake Wars features similar gameplay to Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, but with the addition of controllable vehicles and aircraft as well as multiple AI deployables,[13] asymmetric teams, much larger maps and the option of computer-controlled bot opponents. Unlike the previous Enemy Territory games, Quake Wars is a commercial release rather than a free download.

Enemy Territory: Quake Wars received mostly positive reviews upon release, although it received some criticism on consoles.</desc>

		<name>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</name>
		<desc>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is an action-adventure platform video game developed by Ninja Theory and published by Namco Bandai Games. It was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 5, October 7 and October 8, 2010 in North America, Australia, Japan and Europe respectively.[1][2] A premium version, featuring all DLC content, was made for Microsoft Windows and Sony Playstation 3 and was later released on October 25, 2013.

The story is a re-imagining of the novel Journey to the West written by Wu Cheng'en. Unlike the original story that was set in a fantastical version of ancient China, the game is set 150 years in a future post-apocalyptic world following a global war, with only remnants of humanity left, along with the still active war machines left over from the conflict. Like the original story however, the plot revolves around someone who forces the help and protection of a warrior, with many characters sharing the same names and roles. The game's story was written by Alex Garland, with voice talent and motion capture from Andy Serkis and Lindsey Shaw.</desc>

		<desc>Eragon is a third-person video game released for the PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows, developed by Stormfront Studios. Also released are unique versions of Eragon for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, PSP, and mobile phone handheld gaming systems, primarily developed by Amaze Entertainment.[1]

The game is based upon the Eragon film, which is in turn loosely based on the book Eragon, by Christopher Paolini. The games were released on November 14, 2006 in the United States of America, on November 24, 2006 in European[2] and on November 23, 2006 in Australia[3] in order to coincide with the release of the film. In the game the player takes on the role of the protagonist from the book and film, Eragon, and occasionally controls his dragon Saphira.

The game was generally received poorly by critics, usually receiving press averages around the 4-6 out of 10 region (or the equivalent).[4][5] The combined sales in North America were over 400,000 copies.[6]</desc>

		<desc>Escape Dead Island is an adventure survival horror video game developed by Swedish developer Fatshark and published by German studio Deep Silver. This is the first Dead island game in the series that is a spin-off.

Arriving on the island of Narapela, part of the Banoi archipelago, he finds that not everything is as it seems. Haunted by deja-vus, Cliff will have to make sense of it all. This story-driven adventure lets players delve into the Dead Island universe and unravel the origins of the zombie outbreak.</desc>

		<name>Eschatos</name>
		<desc>Eschatos takes place in the 22nd century where a mysterious organic alien matter - known only as the Purple Erosion - has taken over The Moon. After covering 75% of The Moon's surface, the aliens launch an attack on the Earth using flying saucers to deploy trajectory weapons and ships. The player is tasked with stopping the invasion using a fighter ship capable of great attack and defense technology.
The ship has two modes of fire: the long range Front Shot and the short range Wide Shot. The ship features a regenerative shield capable of absorbing enemy bullets, but with overuse can deteriorate. The game has three game modes including Original, Advanced and Time Attack. In Original mode, there are only two pick-up items including 1Ups and the Flash icon which destroys all enemies and enemy shots on-screen. Advanced mode however includes a few more items including an alternate Flash icon and Power Ups. Collecting Power Ups increase player fire power, but decreases shield percentage.

The game spans over six stages that are organized with about four to six Areas per stage. There is a unique timing score utilized in each game (Eschatos, Judgment Silver Sword and Cardinal Sins): a timer is set to count up with every enemy wave and boss encounter. The timer stops once all enemies/bosses are defeated and the score is determined with how quickly each enemy wave/boss was destroyed.</desc>

		<name>Mayhem 3D</name>
		<desc>Mayhem is a fast paced arcade racing and car destruction game. The inspiration for the game comes from two distinct types of events: Demolition Derby and Banger Racing. A demolition derby is more of an American pastime, primarily at state fairs and the like. Participants take an old beat down car, strip it of all the glass and other "dangerous" elements, spray paint the car and decorate it to their liking, then beat it to death at the main event. The last vehicle standing is the victor. A Banger Race is more practiced in the UK. Races take place on small courses with pits and hills, and drivers are encouraged to send their opponents off course. Courses can have hazards and obstacles, and the "figure 8" shaped course is a staple of the race. No matter whether it's Banger races or demolition derbys, the fact is that everyone love to see the everyman take it to the mat and come out a victor, and that's what Mayhem is all about.</desc>

		<desc>Mercenaries 2: World in Flames is an explosive open-world action game set in a massive, highly reactive, war-torn world. A power-hungry tyrant messes with Venezuela's oil supply, sparking an invasion that turns the country into a warzone. But for you, international crisis is all upside: You are a mercenary, and you profit from chaos. Mercenaries 2 features a slew of potential clients, all willing to pay you to do their dirty work. Dirty deeds, done for exorbitant fees. These are world powers with deep pockets, deep grudges, and enough arms and ammo to start World War III. This is your kind of environment. Mercenaries 2 features the latest and most dangerous in civilian and military tech, everything from shiny new sports cars, to the future-tech satellite-guided bunker-busting mini-nuke. Tanks, APCs, boats, luxury automobiles - you name it, you can have it delivered to you in real time. And if you run out of cash you can always 'acquire' the gear you need in the field. If you see it, you can buy it, steal it, or blow the living crap out of it. Play your own way, or play with the help of a friend in the new cooperative multiplayer mode. You are not a soldier. You don't have to play by anyone's rules. You have your own code: you will fulfill the terms of the contract, no matter what. Not everyone in the world of Mercenaries is as honorable. Everyone will try and screw you, given the chance. They think they can get away with it, because they don't know rule #1: EVERYBODY PAYS.</desc>

		<name>Metal Gear Solid HD Collection</name>
		<desc>From the critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection offers a handful of the most popular Metal Gear Solid titles from the past in true HD for the first time ever. Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The "Metal Gear Solid (MGS)" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected. The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.</desc>

		<desc>Set in the shattered subway of a post apocalyptic Moscow, Metro 2033 is a story of intensive underground survival where the fate of mankind rests in your hands. In 2013 the world was devastated by an apocalyptic event, annihilating almost all mankind and turning the earth's surface into a poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age. The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside. You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised Underground. Having never ventured beyond your Metro Station-City limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat. Your journey takes you from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, where your actions will determine the fate of mankind.</desc>

		<name>Metro: Last Light</name>
		<desc>Metro: Last Light (also known as Metro 2033: A Light of Hope in Russia) is a single-player post-apocalyptic-themed first-person shooter video game with stealth and survival horror elements, developed by Ukrainian studio 4A Games and published by Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in May 2013.[1] PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released August 26, 2014.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, part of the universe of the novel Metro 2033 and its sequels, written by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, but does not follow any direct storylines from the books. Previously announced as Metro 2034,[2] the game is a sequel to the video game Metro 2033, and although Glukhovsky did work with developer 4A Games, it bears no relation to the book Metro 2034. Rumors on his website point to the upcoming book, Metro 2035, to be a novelization of Metro: Last Light, but it will cover the plot and dialogue in much greater detail and length.

Initially, the game was to be published under THQ and expected to be released in the middle of 2012;[3] it was announced on February 2, 2012, that the game would be delayed until the first quarter of 2013, and on March 1, 2013 the game was delayed again until May. Following THQ's closure in January 2013, the intellectual property was acquired by video game publisher Deep Silver.

Metro: Last Light received positive reviews from critics. Praise was directed at the game's story (including its atmosphere, presentation, and environments), graphics (especially on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One), and the improvements made over Metro 2033 (such as the controls, gunplay, sound, and stealth mechanics). The game did, however, draw some criticism for its linear sequences, AI, and technical issues.


ust like the original game Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light is played from the perspective of Artyom, the player-character. The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system, but occasionally missions bring the player above ground.

As a first-person shooter, Metro: Last Light features a variety of firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which the player will use in combat. Combat alternates between the player fighting mutants and the player fighting hostile humans. Mutants do not possess weapons and tend to physically attack the player in swarms, while humans fight with the same firearms available to the player. The game features recharging health rather than a traditional health points system—if the player avoids taking damage for a period, health will slowly recharge. The player can speed up this process by using a stim from a medkit, which will almost instantly heal the player to full health. When the player is severely injured, it may take over twenty seconds to return to full health. Health does not regenerate on, or above the "Hardcore" difficulty.

In the post-apocalyptic environment, ammunition is a rare and essential commodity. Pre-apocalypse military-grade ammunition is used as currency; to avoid "shooting money", the player can also use lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and items. The military-grade ammo can be used to purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations.

The game's locations reflect the dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and noises are frequent, and, for the most part, the player has to rely on their rechargeable flashlight (and sometimes, a pair of night-vision goggles) to find the way around in otherwise total darkness. Even more lethal is the surface, as it is severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times due to the toxic air.[5] Often, locations have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map, leaving the player to try to find their objectives with only a compass.

As Metro: Last Light aims to be immersive, the gameplay and interface are somewhat atypical. The game lacks a health meter, relying on audible heart rate and blood spatters on the screen to show the player's current state of health. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask, which last several minutes each and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. There is no heads-up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail—rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The gas mask can become visibly damaged and will stop functioning if punctured, requiring it to be replaced. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammo and they have to reload. The game does feature sparse traditional HUD elements, such as an ammunition indicator. However, on the hardest difficulty setting, no HUD elements are present, and players have to keep track of ammunition by the partly visible magazines.

There are also certain moral choices in the game that give Karma. Good Karma can be acquired by good actions, such as rescuing people from the enemy characters. Bad Karma can be acquired from evil actions, such as killing people randomly or stealing things.</desc>

		<name>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</name>
		<desc>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is an action-packed adventure-RPG inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Exploring an original story of vengeance and redemption, the game puts players in the role of Talion, a valiant ranger whose family is slain in front of him the night Sauron and his army return to Mordor -- moments before his own life is taken. Resurrected by a Spirit of vengeance and empowered with Wraith abilities, Talion ventures into Mordor and vows to destroy those who have wronged him. Through the course of his personal vendetta, Talion uncovers the truth of the Spirit that compels him, learns the origins of the Rings of Power and ultimately confronts his true nemesis.

Every enemy that players face is a unique individual, differentiated by their personality, strengths and weaknesses. Through the Nemesis System, enemy relationships and characteristics are shaped by player actions and decisions to create personal archenemies that remember and adapt to the player and are distinct to every gameplay session. Gamers are able to craft their own battles, enemies and rewards within the dynamic world that remembers and adapts to their choices, delivering a unique experience to every player.</desc>

Mindjack is a third-person shooter with cover mechanics and unique mind-control elements. The player has the ability to "mind-hack" enemy soldiers and bystanders, either to take control of them directly or enlist them to fight alongside him as mind slaves. Defeating enemies earns experience points which can be applied to Arts (player abilities) and Rules (game modifiers). Single-player and multi-player can be a fluid experience, where online players can hack into other players' games to take control of enemies.</desc>

		<name>Mini Ninjas</name>
		<desc>An ancient samurai warlord returns and raises a new demonic army to subdue the world. But instead of hiring unreliable minions he transforms innocent animals into fearsome warriors. A ninja master notices how every transformation destabilizes the balance of nature, causing storms and earthquakes, and decides to send out his best ninja disciples to restore the order. When none of them returns, he is left with his last choice: the young ninja Hiro and his blunt friend Futo. Players control the characters through different worlds using a third-person perspective with a relative amount of freedom to explore the environment. When lost, the characters can meditate to receive a hint and see an arrow that points into the general direction of the next objective.

During the course of the game they will follow the steps of the other warriors and eventually free four of them to make them playable. The player can switch between any character at any given moment. Each ninja has different abilities. Hiro is an allrounder and the only ninja who can use Kuji spells. Unlocked by finding and praying at hidden shrines, spells include fireballs, whirlwinds and the ability to enter a spirit form where animals can be taken over to have them fight. They also make it easier to spot items and collectibles in the environment. Animals are locked up in cages but also appear when an enemy is defeated and they return to their original form. Futo wields a large hammer and is especially useful to engage larger enemies. The other characters that become available during the course of the game are Suzume, a young girl with a flute that enchants enemies when she plays music, Shun, a master with the bow, Tora who thinks he's a tiger and has big metal claws to proof it, and the acrobat Kunoichi with a long spear.

Characters have basic attacks along with a defence breaker to stun enemies and the ability to block. Acrobatic moves include wall jumping, running along walls and hanging from ledges. All characters have a sneak mode where they can hide in the grass or the environment to cause more damage when attacking or to simply avoid confrontations. Health is restored by gathering fruit and there are collectible items in the environments. When new recipes are bought, these items can be mixed into potions, bombs and power-ups. Characters level up to get better abilities and they all have a different focus attack to cause more damage.</desc>

		<name>MLB Front Office Manager</name>
		<desc>MLB Front Office Manager allows a player to take the role of a baseball general manager over the course of a thirty-year career; the goal is to perform well enough to become inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. The player's GM is rated on eight disciplines including North American scouting, international scouting, pro-league scouting, player development, trades, contract negotiation, owner confidence and leadership. GMs also have former career backgrounds (i.e. ex-manager, lawyer, business person, former player, or talent scout) that affect the GM's disciplines. A GM's ratings improve or regress over his career depending on their performance and will have seasonal goals depending on the club they're hired by. The player will be faced with decisions such as spring training evaluation, initiate and respond to trades, develop rookies, and even bid for Japanese baseball players. The game also promises advanced AI-controlled GMs who have unique motivations.</desc>

		<desc>The adaptation of the classic board game Monopoly for PlayStation supports up to four players. Players can select from eight tokens known from the board game. Any non-human players can be controlled by the AI - ten different AI opponent profiles can be selected.

The game supports a variety of custom rules. These include popular house rules like collecting fines on free parking, double bonus on GO, and having to go around the board once before starting purchasing. Standard rules like auctions, the even-build rule or dealing from jail can be turned off. It is also possible to set the number of buildings in the bank to infinite. Various rules that vary in regional editions of the board game of the can be toggled as well, including higher luxury tax or the option of paying 10% income tax instead of a flat fee.

During a game, the board is seen in a perspective view, with the side where the current token is situated always at the front. Controls are cursor-based point-and-click (the PlayStation mouse is supported). Clicking on Mr. Monopoly makes him throw the dice onto the board, while deals and trades are made from a special sub-menu. When a token is moving, the game plays a matching pre-rendered animation. Each board square also has a special animation played when the player reaches it. For properties, these change from an abandoned scenery for unowned properties to scenes with lived-in houses and hotels for properties that are built out. Both kinds of animations can be turned off before a game.</desc>

		<desc>"Brrrrraaaaiiiinnnnssss!" Load your shotgun, zombies have run amuck in town and it's up to four teenagers to defend their suburbia in this 3rd person shooter while seeking to find the cause of this invasion. In single player mode (which also can be played in co-op with up to three friends), you go through five areas: Shopping Maul, High School Hell, Cemetery Scary, and Evil Castle. Each area has 3 to 5 stages. 

You choose one of the characters to play as, each with their own special abilities: Zack the geek uses ax-type weapons, Carrie the Goth likes swords, Andy the surfer dude uses random objects like toilet plungers and does a Neo-like spin on his weapon to kick enemies around him, and Jennifer the dumb blonde cheerleader has dual batons which can be spun into a tornado-like effect. New weapons and weapon upgrades can be bought from the local mechanic with collected items found throughout each level, and with tokens dropped when zombies die. By using their favorite melee weapon, each character can make a special attack move when their power bar is at maximum level from killing enemies. There's also 16 unique guns built from 25 different weapon parts found in each level and with 3 different upgradable levels of power. Other weapons include wacky ones like lawnmowers, nailguns, cellphone tazers, bicycle grenade launchers, defribulators, and CD shooters, as well as more traditional Molotov cocktails, rocket launchers, and pipe shotguns. Later in the game, even vehicles and ships can be used such as a UFO which has a laser death beam. 

Using the Unreal Engine 3 and Ageia's PhysX enables realistic physics-based destruction along with detailed lighting, environmental and character details. The plot is moved forward by comic-strip cut scenes, including showing the name and abilities of new zombie mutations as they first appear. The multiplayer modes include a four-player deathmatch on a single computer, or a sixteen player game online or over LAN.</desc>

Now the aliens populate the planet, the world is a wasteland and the few remaining human survivors are relegated to dwelling in sewers, subways and basements to plot their revenge.

An action-packed third-person shooter, MorphX drops players into the middle of the fallout in Moscow, Russia. As part of the new resistance, players awaken in an alien laboratory with the option to enhance their stamina and health with Alien DNA, but at the cost of gradually turning into a monster. In an effort to fight the aliens and find an antidote to the mutation, players can choose to either use the Alien DNA to their advantage, or reject it and focus solely on collecting a variety of weapons to take down their enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Collecting medals is the primary scoring mechanic in the game. When an enemy is destroyed using the lard attack, they will drop medals shaped like a pig's head. If enemies are destroyed with the lard attack while a bomb is being used, they will drop "p" items instead of medals. Also, Single medals will periodically drop from enemies even if they are not destroyed using the lard attack.
The medal value starts at 100 points. If there are already medals on screen, the medals that enemies drop will be of an equal value to the medals on screen. If there are no medals on screen, the medal value will increase by 100 points (if the previous value was  1000 points), or 1000 points (if the previous value was  1000 points). The medal value will max out at 10,000 points.
If the player switches from the B-shot to the A-shot, all medals on screen will be automatically collected. If the player fails to collect the last medal on screen, the medal value will divide by a factor of 10. The player is awarded an extend every 10 million points. An extend item can also be found if the third stage mid-boss is destroyed using the pierce shot.
Accessing the second loop requires completing the first five stages without losing a single life. If the extend item is collected in stage 3, the player can die once and still proceed to the second loop. Stages 6–10 are identical to the first five stages, but are much more difficult. In addition to this, score extends are no longer awarded.</desc>

		<name>MUD: FIM Motocross World Championship</name>
		<desc>MUD: FIM Motocross World Championship is a racing motocross (offroad) motorycle game which focuses more on action than simulation. It is licensed and features the original teams, vehicles, courses and athletes from the FIM Championship. 

The heart of the game is the Mud World Tour, which is basically a career mode. By being successful at events (either normal races with 16 athletes, checkpoint races, elimination races, a head to head race with two drivers or freestyle/trick events), the player earns money which can be invested into improving the driver's statistics (endurance, instinct, mobility and strength), equipment (e.g. energy drinks which give a speed boost), the next events, switching to a better team or unlocking the three other drivers. Each driver is a specialists for a certain events which results in more price money.

The other playing modes are single races, playing the Championship (either MX1, MX2 or custom) or participating in freestyle events in which the player needs to perform stunts in order to gain points. In the regular races, tricks only plays a small role because there is only one to perform: when the bike is in the air, the player can press a button with the right timing. With correct timing, a scrub is performed along with a speed boost; when it is screwed up it results in a Whip without advantages. Multiplayer allows for races with up to 12 players.

In the PS Vita version, there are only half the machines in each race (6 in multiplayer and 8 in single-player races)</desc>

		<name>Naruto: Rise of a Ninja</name>
		<desc>The first Naruto game made by North Americans, Naruto: Rise of a Ninja is an action game with puzzle and RPG elements. Battles take place in arenas, reminiscent of classic one-on-one fighting games, but there's more to just each character's combos: ninjutsu mini-games, rage mode, thrown weapons and replacement technique add spice to the action.

You follow the story as Naruto, completing quests, earning respect and helping out villagers to earn training points and unlock abilities and ninjutsus. There are also side-quests, mini-games and hidden collectibles to gain even more training points and unlock or upgrade scrolls and thrown weapons. You can also enter Fight mode, where 11 characters of the series are available. Play Tournament mode against increasingly difficult AI, or play multiplayer fights against a friend, online or offline, or against AI. Finally there's the Forest of Death Tournament, where you battle online opponents and must win 5 matches in a row. Downloadable characters, each with unique combos and ninjutsus, are available.</desc>

		<desc>Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, known in Japan as Naruto Shippuden: Narutimate Storm Generations (NARUTO 疾風伝 ナルティメットストーム ジェネレーション) is the third installment of the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, is a video game in the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja fighting game series, developed by CyberConnect2 and published by Namco Bandai Games. It is based on the Naruto manga series by Masashi Kishimoto. First revealed in June 2011, it was first released in Japan on February 23, 2012 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles and on March 13 in North America, in Europe on March 30 and Australia on March 29, 2012.

This title features both characters from the previous installments Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm and Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, thus featuring two incarnations from characters who noticeably changed across the series, alongside the newly introduced. The gameplay from its predecessors has been modified for faster battles while interaction between players was improved through a series of collectible cards that allows them to compete between each other to obtain new content. Additionally, the game shows original storylines produced by the group in charge of Naruto's animated adaptations, Studio Pierrot. The game has been well received by video game publications and has sold over a million units worldwide as of July 2012.</desc>

		<name>Naruto: The Broken Bond</name>
		<desc>After the Sand Village's attack on Leaf Village was beaten back, it looks like things in Leaf Village might calm down for a change...until Orochimaru appears, eager for vengeance in his quest for power, and makes an attack on Leaf Village of his own. Now Naruto, along with his friends and teachers, must help to rebuild the village and stop the plans of the nefarious figures who would threaten their peace.

Naruto: The Broken Bond is a direct sequel to Rise of a Ninja, and is a similar action-platform game. It directly follows the anime's story, picking up right where the previous game ended. The player controls Naruto and up to two teammates exploring the world around Leaf Village, taking missions from Jiraiya and the Hokage. Battles play out as a one-on-one side-view fighting game, and new in this title is the addition of tag play and team attacks.

There are many small changes to the way the game works. The use of many jutsu has been simplified: chakra focus is now activated automatically when climbing walls or walking on water, and the addition of other playable characters brings a much wider variety of abilities to make use of when exploring or fighting. The game also has a substantial variety of mini-games and side quests, including fishing, bounty hunting, hide-and-seek, and of course the game booths in Tanzaku. Completing these quests will improve Naruto's fighting abilities.

In addition to the game's story mode, there is also a straight fighting mode for up to four players. It can be played either locally or online over Xbox Live. As the story mode is played, new characters and stages are unlocked for use in the fighting mode. The game features three difficulty levels, as well as full voice acting in both English and Japanese.</desc>

The Whelen Modified Tour is not included in the PS3 and 360 versions of the game, but is still present in the PS2 version.</desc>

The main character, Naughty Bear, is a shabby teddy bear who has a tendency to be mischievous, which earns him the dislike of the other bears. Like the other teddy bears, he does not speak but instead conveys his emotions through a variety of sounds and facial expressions. His actions are influenced by an unseen narrator with a demeanor reminiscent of that of a young children's television show host.[2][3]</desc>

Tanner and Tobias witness this from Tanner's car, pursuing Jericho as he causes havoc on the streets of the city. Tanner ends up in front of Jericho in an alleyway, and gets pushed in front of a tractor trailer. A hard crash occurs, putting him into a coma. The game will take place in Tanner's coma dream</desc>

		<desc>Need for Speed is going back to its roots and that can mean only one thing: police chases and ridiculously expensive supercars. Hot Pursuit doesn't make any claims to be the most realistic racer out there, even compared to previous games, but it does aim to be the most fun. You can play either as cops or racers, but both sides get ultra powerful cars and a range of power-ups to get them to the race's end. If you're a cop your job is to chase down your quarry using any means necessary, including roadblocks. If you're playing as a racer you'll often be in a slower car than your pursuer, but you won't be tied to any of their rules and get your own powerful power-ups like the radar jammer.</desc>

		<desc>Need for Speed: Most Wanted (also known as Need for Speed: Most Wanted - A Criterion Game; commonly shortened to Most Wanted 2012) is a 2012 open world racing game with nonlinear gameplay, developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts. Announced on 4 June 2012, during EA's E3 press conference, Most Wanted is the nineteenth title in the long-running Need for Speed series and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation Vita, iOS and Android, beginning in North America on 30 October 2012, with a Wii U version following on 14 March 2013 under the title Need for Speed: Most Wanted U.[10] The game picked up on the Most Wanted intellectual property, as opposed to the Hot Pursuit reboot that Criterion developed previously.[12]

Need for Speed: Most Wanted received positive reviews, which focused on the world map that blended the styles of previous Burnout and Need for Speed games, and the social features, while criticism fell on the single-player mode. Following its release, the game won several awards including the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards for Best Driving Game and was nominated for Best British Game and Best Online Multiplayer at the 2013 BAFTA Awards, and was repeatedly recognized as the best driving/racing game of 2012 by several outlets.</desc>

		<name>NHL 13</name>
		<desc>NHL 13 is an ice hockey video game developed by EA Canada published by EA Sports. It is the 22nd installment of the NHL series and was released on September 11, 2012 in North America, Europe as well as Australia and New Zealand. The game was released on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, featuring Philadelphia Flyers forward Claude Giroux on the cover.[1] The game was featured at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012 (E3 2012), which took place between June 5–7, 2012. The demo of the game was released on August 21–22, 2012, at the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store.[4]

There was a vote deciding which player would be on the NHL 13 cover. Anybody could vote on the player(s) they wished to see on the cover of the game. The vote started on March 29, 2012 with 60 NHL players in a single-elimination voting with two players in each match-up, and was closed on June 4, receiving over 25 million votes worldwide.[5] On June 20, Claude Giroux was named the winner, over Pekka Rinne at the 2012 NHL Awards in Las Vegas.[6]

An exclusive "Stanley Cup Collector's Edition" was also released, apart from the actual NHL 13 game. The Collector's Edition includes five random Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) player packs from the two 2012 Stanley Cup Finals teams; a Gold Jumbo HUT pack including legend Wayne Gretzky; and a boost pack featuring the CCM RBZ stick.[7]

Just like in NHL 12, Gary Thorne (play-by-play) and Bill Clement (color) provide commentary for NHL 13.[8]

This year, for the first time, two playable female characters, Hayley Wickenheiser and Angela Ruggiero have been added.[9] In NHL 12, users could create female characters, but there were no real-life players.[10]

On September 20, Gamesindustry.biz reported that NHL 13 had posted the best first week sales in the franchise's history.[11]</desc>

Museum guard-turned entrepreneur Larry Daley discovers that his favorite exhibits, and some of his best friends, from New York's Natural History Museum are being shipped off to the archives at the Smithsonian. Larry gets a distress call from the miniature cowboy, Jedediah, reporting that Egyptian ruler Kahmunrah and a trio of heinous henchmen--namely Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon and Al Capone--are plotting to take over the museum, then the world. Speeding to the nation's capitol, Larry is clearly in over his head. But with some impressive new pals, including the irrepressible Amelia Earhart, along with familiar friends Teddy Roosevelt and Octavius, Larry will stop at nothing to restore the Smithsonian before dawn.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Gaiden 3</name>
		<desc>Ninja Gaiden 3 is the third main game in the series since the reboot in 2004 and once again stars ninja Ryu Hayabusa as the protagonist. The game starts in medias res with Ryu attacking a giant creature through a quick time event. Soon after it is revealed through a flashback that he was contacted by the government because an unknown group launched a terrorist attack in London and took control of the area surrounding the prime minister's residence, taking him hostage. In a video they declare they want Hayabusa handed to them. He travels to London from Japan but has no intention of just surrendering. Later on in the game it is revealed the group behind the attack is a cult of alchemists who want to establish a new world order with Ryu as the catalyst. From London the journey eventually takes him to a city in the Rub' al Khali desert, Abysmo Island in the Indian Ocean, Hayabusa Village in Japan, the Howard Phillips Plains in Antarctica, the Pacific Ocean, and finally back in Tokyo, Japan. The story no longer involves the struggle with Fiends and Archfiends from the previous games.

Just like the other titles in the series gameplay is centered around fast-paced combat with a quick succession of moves to build up combos and fight off multiple enemies at the same time. Moves are performed with a combination of weak and strong attacks. Incoming attacks can be blocked and there is a new slide manoeuvre and a visual camera trick in slow motion when he performs a body-piercing move, along with finishers. Enemies in the air can be attacked using an auto-targeting bow with unlimited ammo and there are also shurikens. The ninja can fly down and attack from the air, use a new technique to climb walls using his kunai with a quick succession of buttons, or sneak up from behind and perform a stealth kill. Many of the opponents are mechanical and equipped with guns. Early in the game he receives an evil curse that fuses his dragon sword into his arm, causing it to pulsate with veins. This makes Ryu feel the pain of each victim as he kills someone. The effect of the curse makes him more powerful or weaker at certain moments in the game. After killing a certain amount of enemies the arm lights up red and he can perform Grip of the Murder to perform a devastating attack. Compared to the earlier games enemies are no longer as deadly efficient in their attacks and Ryu can sustain more damage where an arcade-like approach is often put before strategic and slow fighting.

There is no longer a store and items are few. A few new swords are discovered gradually and arrows for the bow also become stronger. The Ninpo concept from the previous games is still present, but in only one form. Defeating enemies fills up a bar and once it is full Ninpo can be activated to transform into a dragon to kill all enemies in the environment and regain full health. In the multiplayer additional Ninpo are available. The save system with statues has been replaced by checkpoints where a falcon swoops down, also restoring health. The game structure is largely linear, but in larger environments a button can be used to sense the path to follow when stuck.

After completing the first level Shadows of the World is unlocked, the online multiplayer mode which is a first for the series. It offers cooperative challenges and online deathmatch games for up to eight players simultaneously. Progress is persistent and the experience while fighting is used to unlock new tools and abilities permanently for the character. The PlayStation 3 version is compatible with the Move peripheral for controlling and guiding the attacks.</desc>

		<desc>Starting in the African front of WWII, the Wolf Pack, a squad of supernatural soldiers fighting for the Allies, must undertake a series of dangerous missions to retake Africa and take the fight to Berlin. Standing in their way are Nazis, zombie Nazis, vampire Nazis, and more.

Operation Darkness is a tactical role-playing game. Move units, have them attack, or use special abilities. Also available in this game are cover tactics, which allow for combined attacks, covering fire, and faster movement. Between missions, supplies can be purchased and equipped, skills can be swapped out, and new missions can be selected. Story missions cannot be replayed, but optional replayable non-story missions exist to give extra experience and equipment.

Online missions exist, where up to four players, each bringing up to three units from the campaign, can fight the Axis powers together. Experience and gear earned in this mode is not kept, but victories unlock new gear to purchase between missions.</desc>

		<name>Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising</name>
		<desc>Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is a military simulation video game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 developed by British game developer Codemasters. Codemasters has advertised the game as a tactical shooter designed to represent modern infantry combat realistically. It is a stand-alone sequel to Bohemia Interactive's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, but was developed entirely by Codemasters due to a falling-out between the two companies.[3</desc>

		<name>Operation Flashpoint: Red River</name>
		<desc>Operation Flashpoint: Red River enlists players to lead a hostile force in a remote land, surrounded by serene mountains and deadly serious mission objectives. Building upon Dragon Rising, the series' high-def generation debut, additions in Red River include refinements to squad and enemy AI, a more accessible inventory system, and character class roles, with player-picked upgrades as experience is earned. The game is designed for four-player co-op, and even in single-player modes, a second player can drop in and out of the battle at any time. Although modern military shooter action is the substance of Red River, the violent combat is presented through the personal experiences of the main characters, a small team of Marine Corps infantrymen. The adventure plays out in the landlocked country of Tajikistan, bordered by Afghanistan to the south and China to the east. Leading in from earlier Operation Flashpoint briefings, threats from the People's Liberation Army play a significant role as the game's narrative develops, but much of the game takes place to the north and west, along the banks of the Vakhsh, known as the "Red River" to the people who live there. With shifting international tensions, the political-thriller plot line is broken into three separate acts. The mission begins with an assignment to secure an isolated dam system, in need of repair, against terrorist activity.</desc>

		<name>Overlord II</name>
		<desc>Overlord II is a 2009 action role-playing game and sequel to the 2007 video game Overlord, developed by Triumph Studios and published by Codemasters for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. All versions were released in North America on June 23, 2009, then later in Europe on June 26 and Australia on July 9, 2009, alongside two spin-offs; Overlord: Dark Legend and Overlord: Minions for the Wii and the Nintendo DS respectively. A Linux version is under development.[3]

Continuing the style of the series, the game is set in a fantasy realm where players take the role of the Overlord, a mysterious warrior whose goal is to destroy or conquer the land by commanding hordes of small creatures known as "Minions". The story directly follows the events of the first Overlord game, with the succeeding Overlord rising to power opposing a Roman-styled military power known as the "Glorious Empire". The story was written by Rhianna Pratchett and maintains a satirical tone and dark humor towards the fantasy setting and genre.</desc>

		<name>Overlord</name>
		<desc>Controlling a mysterious figure that has inherited the legacy of the evil, long-dead Overlord, the player emerges, near death, from the ruins of the old Overlord's Dark Tower. Only the player's actions determine if they will rise to become the new all-powerful Overlord; it's all down to how much of a bad ass they want to be in order to succeed...evil or really evil! Played out with plenty of black humour and dark irony, the game immerses players in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters. Overlord's key innovation is the introduction of an array of impish creatures – the Minions. They believe you are the old Overlord reborn and will use their unique skills to fetch, fight and die for you. Throughout the game players actively control a horde of these gremlin-like critters and they follow your every instruction no matter how despotic or, for the Minions, life threatening it is.</desc>

The new CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.</desc>

		<desc>Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection faithfully recreates eight of the most memorable tables from the golden age of pinball in photorealistic 3D. Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced "Magna-Save" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.</desc>

		<name>Portal 2</name>
		<desc>Portal 2 is a 2011 first-person puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts while online distribution of the Windows, OS X and Linux versions is handled by Valve's content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Before the game's release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.

The game retains Portal??'?s gameplay elements, and adds new features, including tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like 'gels' accelerating the player's speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or place portals on any surface. These gels were created by the team from the Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of Paint. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell, awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.

Although some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several named it their Game of the Year. Portal 2 has since been hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time.</desc>

		<desc>Power Gig: Rise of the SixString is a rhythm game developed by Seven45 Studios, a sister company of First Act which produces low-cost, entry-level musical instruments.[1] While the game is similar to guitar-based games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, Power Gig ships with a unique guitar game controller that acts as both a standalone six-stringed guitar and game controller with note-matching games. Because of the nearness of the controller and gameplay to that of a real guitar, it has attracted musicians including Eric Clapton, Dave Matthews, and Kid Rock that have shied away from music games before due to the simplicity of the button-mashing concept. The game is also distributed with the AirStrike, a drum controller that works on motion sensing. The game was shipped on October 19, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</desc>

		<name>The Lord of the Rings: The War in the North</name>
		<desc>War in the North is an action role-playing hack and slash game played from a third-person perspective. The game features three playable characters; Eradan (a Ranger), Farin (a Dwarf) and Andriel (an Elf). When the player begins the game for the first time, they must chose which character to control. However, they can switch characters during a single play-through either by using the "switch character" option at the end of each level, or by loading a previously saved game and selecting a different character at the character select screen. Each character has their own unique weaponry, attacks, skills and special abilities. Eradan can use a bow, a two-handed sword, a one-handed sword and a shield, or two single-handed weapons. His skill tree is built around stealth.[4][5] His special ability allows him to find the tracks of other Rangers and follow them to secret stashes of items and weapons.[6] Farin can use two-handed heavy weapons such as axes, a single-handed weapon and a shield, or a crossbow. His skill tree is built around melee combat.[7][8] His special ability allows him to detect fissures and weakness in walls and rocks, smashing them open to find money, items and gems.[6] Andriel can use a staff and a shield, or a staff and a single-handed weapon. Her staff also serves as her long-range weapon. Her skill tree is built around offensive and defensive spell casting.[8][9] She can also create potions from alchemy ingredients collected in the field, and her special ability allows her to find secret passages marked with hidden elven glyphs.[6]</desc>

		<path>./Games/The Outfit [PAL][NTSCU].iso</path>
		<name>The Outfit</name>
		<desc>The Outfit is a World War II game that, unlike many other games in the genre, focuses almost entirely on destruction. While you will usually need to take a tactical approach to gameplay when on foot, you will earn points called "Field Units" that can be used to buy equipment like tanks and gun turrets to destroy Axis soldiers. You can simply buy equipment by using the Y button on your controller in conjunction with the left thumbstick button to select an item to buy. As such, the game developers call The Outfit "destruction on demand". The equipment you buy with Field Units will initially be occupied by AI-controlled soldiers, but you can replace whoever is using the equipment so that you can have some fun blowing stuff up. Sporting a fully destructible environment, almost everything in The Outfit can be blown up.

You can play as one of three characters. Tommy Mac can take lots of damage before dying, and comes equipped with a flamethrower and machine gun, but equipment will cost him more Field Units than other characters. Deuce Williams comes equipped with a rocket launcher and pistol, and doesn't need as much Field Units to buy stuff as Tommy does, but he isn't nearly as strong as Tommy. JD Tyler is the most accurate of the three, sporting a sniper rifle and shotgun, but unfortunately he will die with one shot, so he must take an extremely tactical approach to gameplay.</desc>

		<name>The Price Is Right: Decades</name>
		<desc>The Price is Right: Decades is a video game based on the popular TV show "The Price is Right". It is the third "Price is Right" video game developed by Ludia Inc. for Wii and the first for Xbox 360, but the very first to allow players to play as their Mii characters/Xbox Avatars instead of Ludia avatars. It is also the first game of the series that is completely rendered in 3D.

The game starts in a backstage lounge, where the player is asked to help the lovely Jessica, one of the "beauties" from the show, to go through a series of "The Price is Right" VHS tapes. Jessica will put the tapes in the VCR and the player will be transported into the show, where he/she will bid on several items and compete against other players to win fabulous prizes and money.

In single player mode, the player will first go to Contestants' Row and bid on the selected item against 3 NPCs. If the player's bid is the closest to that item's retail price, without going over, he/she will then go on to play a pricing game. The player will then go to the Showcase Showdown to spin the wheel. If the player beats the NPC's best score while spinning the wheel (by landing on the highest number, without going over 1$), he or she will then go to the Showcase, just like on the TV show.

In multiplayer mode, up to four players can compete against each other on Contestants' Row, pricing games, Showcase Showdown and the Showcase. The player with the most money wins.

The Price is Right: Decades features pricing games from four different decades; the 70s, the 80s, the 90s and the 2000s decade. Each decade's set from the TV show has been faithfully recreated in 3D. There is one pricing game for every year the show has been on air, up until the year 2010. Among the included pricing games are Professor Price, Plinko, Hole in One, Golden Road, Spelling Bee, Rat Race, Pathfinder, and many others. The Xbox 360 version is also compatible with Kinect and features an online mode.</desc>

		<desc>The player is able to explore Nazi-occupied Paris, some of the French countryside and parts of Germany.[3] Color is a key element in the gameplay. Areas which are heavily controlled by the Nazis are represented in black and white, with the exception of the irises of characters' eyes, city lights, blue symbols of the French Resistance, and various German symbols, which are bright red and complete with swastikas. In order to make that district colored ("inspired") again, players must weaken the German forces occupying the area. In doing so, that district's citizens regain their hope, visually represented by making the area vibrant and full of color. This also affects gameplay; in black and white areas, German soldiers are present in large numbers, making it far more likely that Sean will be detected in his rebellious activities.</desc>

		<name>The Testament of Sherlock Holmes</name>
		<desc>The tables are turned on fiction's greatest detective as he becomes the focus of an investigation into crimes that include blackmail, destruction of evidence, and even murder in The Testament of Sherlock Holmes. Set in London in 1898, players take on the role of Holmes as he retrieves a priceless set of jewels, only to be accused of replacing them with cheap imitations. With evidence mounting, the city begins to lose faith in the detective, and gamers must prove his innocence by examining crime scenes, collecting evidence, questioning suspects, and using his famed deduction skills.

Xbox 360 gamers can switch between first- and third-person views as they explore the city freely, choosing which leads to follow and which to ignore, and even reenacting crimes to determine a suspect's guilt or innocence. Things are never quite what they seem, though, and as Sherlock's behavior gets increasingly erratic, players take on the role of his trusty sidekick Doctor Watson and try to determine if Holmes is capable of the crimes for which he has been accused.</desc>

In the game, Thor battles through the numerous worlds of Norse mythology that span realms ranging from primal worlds of fire and ice to extraordinary planets inhabited by Frost Giants and Trolls to save Asgard, the capital city of the Norse Gods. Thor must overcome monstrous foes lifted from the pages of the comics including Ulik, Ymir, and Surtur, as well as other monstrous denizens. Players will wield the iconic Mjolnir, Thor's legendary hammer, to fight enemies on an immense scale while controlling the elemental storm powers of lightning, thunder, and wind to vanquish enemies. As Thor earns Valor points through his exploits, players can acquire new abilities, powers, and weapon upgrades.</desc>

Players build these incredible WHOA Coasters to leap from one track to another, launch through the air like cannonballs, blast through a burning rings of fire and more.

A new lighthearted story ties together more than 100 missions, complete with 34 playable multiplayer theme-park games and social interaction with park guests that's better than ever. The in-depth conversations both advance the plot and suggest better ways to manage the park. But is every guest to be trusted?</desc>

It was released for Xbox and PlayStation in North America on March 3, 2009,[1][2] for Windows on March 17,[3] for iOS on December 9,[4] for BlackBerry on January 8, 2010,[5] for Palm Pre on April 2,[6] for Android on September 13,[7] and for Symbian on January 16, 2011.[8] A Wii version was announced, but was ultimately canceled.[9] In September 2010, a sequel titled Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X 2 was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The Microsoft Windows and Wii versions were released in November 2010.

The story of the game takes place during the time of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2. H.A.W.X is set in the near future where private military companies have essentially replaced government-run military in many countries. The player is placed in the shoes of David Crenshaw; an elite ex-United States Air Force pilot who was recruited by one of these corporations, fighting whomever and whenever he is told to. Crenshaw later returns to the Air Force together with his team, trying to prevent the PMC from initiating a full-scale attack on the United States.

H.A.W.X received mixed reviews from critics.</desc>

		<name>Tomb Raider</name>
		<desc>Tomb Raider is a 2013 action-adventure video game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix's European subsidiary. It is the tenth title in the Tomb Raider franchise, and operates as a reboot that reconstructs the origins of Lara Croft. Tomb Raider was first released on 5 March 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and later on 23 January 2014 for OS X, on 27 April 2016 for Linux, and on 7 March 2017 for Shield TV.

Crystal Dynamics began development of Tomb Raider soon after the release of Tomb Raider: Underworld in 2008. Rather than a sequel, the team decided to completely reboot the series, re-establishing the origins of Lara Croft for the second time, as they did with Tomb Raider: Legend. Tomb Raider is set on Yamatai, an island from which Lara, who is untested and not yet the battle-hardened explorer she is in other titles in the series, must save her friends and escape while being hunted down by a malevolent cult.

Gameplay elements focus more on survival, although exploration is used within the game when exploring the island and various optional tombs. It is also the first game in the main series to have multiplayer, the first game in the series to be published by Square Enix, after the latter's acquisition of Eidos Interactive in 2009, and the first game in the series to be given a "Mature" rating from the ESRB. Camilla Luddington was announced to voice and perform as Lara Croft in 2010, replacing Keeley Hawes.</desc>

It uses an improved version of the Legend game engine,[3] and it includes all of the original environments from Tomb Raider.[3]

The game was co-developed by Crystal Dynamics and Buzz Monkey Software for the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 2, Windows and Wii.[4] Eidos announced 1 June 2007 as the European release date for the PS2 and Windows version, with the North American release to follow on 5 June 2007.[5][6] Additionally, the subscription PC gaming service GameTap announced that the game will be available on their service on the same day as the game went to retailers.[7] The PSP version was released on 9 August 2007 in the United States and on 26 October 2007 in Europe, with the Wii version released in Europe on 7 December 2007.[8] An Xbox 360 version was released on 23 October 2007[9] and a version for the PlayStation 3 is included in The Tomb Raider Trilogy collection released in March 2011.[10] The Mac OS X version of the game was released in February 2008 by Feral Interactive.[1]

The game was well received by critics, but only sold 1.3 million copies worldwide, making it the least commercially successful game in the Tomb Raider franchise.[11]</desc>

		<name>Tomb Raider: Legend</name>
		<desc>Indeed a legend in her own time, Lara Croft returns to consoles in 2006 with a new look, a new game, and a new developer. Revamped physics and an enhanced control scheme allow for more free-flowing action, while graphical improvements present a redesigned Lara who is immediately expressive, more believably proportioned, and as strikingly attractive as ever.

Lady Croft's new look in Legend is based in part on 20-year-old British model Karima Adebibe. Lara now boasts smoother animations, a more realistic deportment, and a number of costume changes. The original Tomb Raider games were popular for their innovative blend of gaming styles as well as for their distinguished female lead, however, and this game is designed to return fans to the winning combination of 3D platforming, environmental puzzle-solving, and third-person shooting found in the blockbuster originals.

While the storyline of Tomb Raider: Legend is told around the series' traditional "tomb raiding" action, Lara must also adventure through modern city levels, proving her acrobatic skill set is as applicable to skyscrapers and cement as it is to unforgiving wilderness and ancient architecture. New equipment, such as the grappling hook and communication device, offer new abilities. A number of vehicles become available along the way, as well, for special gameplay sequences.

For the first time in the series, stalwart Eidos studio Crystal Dynamics (Gex, Legacy of Kain, Project: Snowblind) was developer of this Tomb Raider game, instead of the franchise's creator, Core. The designers at Crystal Dynamics have endeavored to apply their extensive experience in the 3D action genre toward reinvigorating one of gaming's most recognizable and beloved characters.</desc>

		<name>Tomb Raider: Underworld</name>
		<desc>Following the franchise's legendary return to success under the direction of Crystal Dynamics, Underworld, the studio's sophomore production with Lara Croft, aims to maintain the high level of solid, free-flowing action that reinvigorated the series, while bringing back more of the spooky exploration and challenging jumping puzzles that helped define the classic Tomb Raider games of the late '90s.

Developers strove to create a smooth-moving, contextually integrated character. Motion-capture technology is used for the first time in the series, with the 3D recordings of a world-class gymnast bringing Lara's jumps, flips, and kicks to life. In all, Lara's movement throughout the game incorporates over 2,000 animations. 

It takes a god's weapon to kill a god. Lara is set on a quest to obtain the power of Mjöllnir, the hammer of the invincible Thor. Lara's acrobatics and cunning are pushed to their limits in elaborate, sprawling platform puzzles set among ancient tombs and ruins in the jungles of Mexico, the coast of Thailand, beneath the frigid arctic seas, and in other forbidden places of mystic power around the world.</desc>

The main drive of the game is that your hanging around with a skating group and its leader, who also happens to be a skating legend, at their skate park in Beverly Hills called Skate Ranch. Throughout the game you must help your friends by getting skate pieces for Skate Ranch.

The game marks the third reinvention of the series, with Pro Skater being the first, and Underground being the second. It comes with brand new features like the ability to change your personal appearance in game, as well as the ability to get off of the skateboard and use a BMX. For the first time all of levels are strung together into one big environment, which gets rid of loading times and menu selection.

Old features were also kept like Create-a-park, which dates back to the Pro Skater series. Missions are still acquired by going up to random people or friends and accepting the mission they want you to run.

The game also includes a multiplayer mode and co-op for up to 2 players for added replay value.</desc>

		<desc>Too Human is an action role-playing game developed by Canadian developer Silicon Knights and published by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox 360 in 2008. The game is noted for having remained in development hell for almost ten years, originally planned for release on the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Development later went into the Nintendo GameCube in 2000 before eventually selling the rights to Microsoft in 2005.

Originally planned as a part of a game trilogy, the story is a science-fictional futuristic retelling of Norse mythology that portrays the Æsir, the Norse gods, as cybernetically enhanced humans, tasked with protecting mankind from the onslaught of Loki's army of machines. The player takes the role of the Norse god Baldur, who is less cybernetic than the other gods, thus being "too human".</desc>

		<name>Transformers: The Game</name>
		<desc>Transformers: The Game is the name of multiple versions of a video game based on the 2007 live action film Transformers, all of which were released in North America in June 2007. Home console and PC versions were developed by Traveller's Tales for the PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3 and PC. A different PlayStation Portable version was developed by Savage Entertainment.

Transformers Autobots and Transformers Decepticons are the Nintendo DS versions of Transfomers: The Game. Vicarious Visions, who was tasked with bringing the adaptation to the Nintendo DS, chose to adapt the DS version into two separate games.[1] Autobots follows the heroes' perspective while Decepticons follows the villains'. Unlike games with multiple SKUs such as Pokémon which feature only minor differences between versions, these are two separate games, sharing some basic similarities, but with unique characters, missions and locations.[2]</desc>

		<path>./Games/Transformers Devastation [RF].iso</path>
		<name>Transformers: Devastation</name>
		<desc>Transformers: Devastation is an action game based on the Transformers franchise, specifically the original cartoon series from the 1980s now known as Generation 1. It has the same bright visual style using cel-shaded graphics. The main story mode has five difficulty levels and tells how the Decepticons plan to cyberform planet Earth after Megatron finds a way to control plasma energy. He uses this technique to turn organic material into metal. The Autobots need to prevent this and eventually five different characters are playable: Bumblebee, Grimlock, Optimus Prime, Sideswipe and Wheeljack. Next to the main story mode there is a challenge mode.

The gameplay is similar to other titles by developer Platinum Games. The game is largely played as a 3D action brawler where missions are divided into smaller areas with short cut-scenes in between to further the story. The Autobots link light and heavy attack in different patterns to form combos. When a blue flash appears during a combo it can be finished off with an attack in vehicle form. Robots can freely switch between robot and vehicle form. The latter is used to move around quickly and there are also longer driving sequences, often when chasing or escaping. While driving, ranged weapons can be fired and there is a rush attack and often obstacles to dodge and booster portals to receive extra speed. Melee weapons include swords, gauntlets and hammers and ranged weapons are blasters, grenade launchers etc.

While fighting in robot form, four weapon slots are available per character. A large amount of melee and ranged weapons can be collected during missions and they can be switched on the fly. Ranged weapons have an energy meter and when empty require some time to recharge. Another meter is filled up by attacking and when full a devastating attack can be triggered, unique for each Autobot. Levels often have hidden items and collectibles. There are transpatial converters that temporary reveal a hidden container in another location. A stomp attack launched from the air is sometimes used to reveal items hidden below the surface. The Autobots can also pick up and throw objects and this technique is sometimes used to solve small environment puzzles. By timing correctly incoming attacks can be dodged, which slows down time, similar to Witch Time in Bayonetta, providing an opportunity to counter. Additional attacks can be purchased later on, such as a parry move where an incoming attack can be countered right away. The game has many encounters with large robot bosses where weak points need to be exploited. After each fight a ranking is shown based on the performance.

During gameplay green and blue energon cubes can be picked up to restore health and weapon energy respectively. New missions are always started at the Ark headquarters. The player gets to select the Autobot and can define the loadout from the large inventory of weapons. Weapons have their own levels and can be made stronger through synthesis, merging weapons with a base one and the secondary ones used for parts. The credits currency earned during missions can be given to Wheeljack. He develops T.E.C.H. that provides enhanced abilities. Players need to complete a quick timing mini-game to develop them and when finished they can be selected from a large pool for two slots. Equipped T.E.C.H. can be different for each mission.</desc>

		<desc>Players can once again choose from a cast of noble Autobots or evil Decepticons and battle to determine the fate of Earth as Hasbro's "robots in disguise" return for their second feature film, and second movie-based game, in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The single-player campaign gives gamers a glimpse of the action from both perspectives of the ongoing war, with players taking control of Bumblebee, Optimis Prime, or other Autobots in one mission, then commanding Starscream or Megatron in another. A new transforming system lets gamers switch from robot mode, to vehicle mode, to weapon mode on the fly, and each robot comes equipped with a special ability and several upgradeable weapons and skills. Multiplayer fans can head online to team up with or take on friends in "Deathmatch" and "Team Deathmatch" modes, attempt to take out the opposing faction's leader in "One Shall Stand" mode, strategically capture sections of the map in "Control Points" mode, and collect pieces of the Allspark in "Battle for the Shards"</desc>

		<name>Tropico 3</name>
		<desc>With Tropico 3 the series returns to its roots, playing once again during the time-period 1950-2000. Being more of a remake, than a real successor, the game once again gives the player full control over a banana republic in the Caribbean. To successfully live through his term in office, El Presidente needs to build a booming economy and keep his inhabitants happy as well as the USA and USSR.

Most of the city is built by the player himself including apartment buildings and streets. While some buildings need space to do their job (like farms), others need a road-connection or don't function without electricity. The only buildings that pop up automatically are homes of poor people. To build up his city, the player of course needs money. Money is earned several different ways. Every year the player gets foreign aid from the superpowers. Several times a year a tanker comes by and transports away export goods like oil (the new resource in Tropico 3) or bananas, also bringing money in. Another way to earn money is to make the island tourist friendly and rip them off while they are visiting. The least of the players income comes from his own people who pay lease, use the available entertainment program and such. How much everything costs is determined by the player. He is also responsible for employing from overseas, if the required expertise isn't yet available on his island which on the other hand enrages the Nationalists on the island. The Nationalists are one of the many groups of people the player needs to make happy besides each individual themselves.

In addition each citizen is his or her own entity, with their own names, relationships to other citizens, wants and desires. Some feel the need to excel in studies, others seek religious enlightenment, some just want to have a good time. They even take political affiliations and work towards those ends. The citizens do not blindly follow orders, they must be persuaded through meeting their desires, or just pure greed or terror meaning bribing them or putting out a contract on them. The latter is especially useful to keep the rebels at bay but if all fails and the rebels attack, the player's army as well as himself engage in an automatic battle until only one side stands. The game ends if the palace is blown up, the player doesn't get re-elected or the USA/USSR decide that El Presidente has become a pain in the butt. In addition the missions in the campaign feature objectives like have 150 tourists visit the island.

Besides the new 3D-engine, the biggest change in comparison to Tropico is the inclusion of a 3D-Avatar of the player inside the game. Generated at the beginning from scratch or by using one of the pre-existing characters like Fidel Castro, the avatar can be sent around the island, visiting production facilities or construction sites to temporarily increase the production and building speed. The avatar can also be send to the palace where he holds a speech and increases the freedom of the listing inhabitants.

The game features an editor that doesn't allow the player to create a new island, those are pre-defined or random generated, but instead allows him to build a new challenge with its own goals, events and difficulty-settings. These challenges can then be uploaded onto the Tropico 3-server and everyone can try and beat the current highscore on that map. No other multiplayer-mode is available.</desc>

This time the player rules the island from the 19th to the 20th century, starting as governor for the colony before releasing the grip of the motherland. During the years two world wars and the cold war era have to be mastered. There are other islands nearby and also some super powers, which may allies, trading partners (for the new trade fleet) or dangerous foes. As the time passes by new technologies and buildings become available, while other buildings are obsolete and need to be replaced to stay up to date. 

One of the new resources in the game is the own extended family, which are also present on the map. These family members can be used as generals, managers or diplomats. Most of the other resources have to be discovered first, using expeditions which will explore the island and may find new resources or ancient ruins. An important addition in this release are the cooperative and competitive multiplayer games for up to four players.</desc>

		<desc>Turning Point: Fall of Liberty is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Spark Unlimited for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. It was released in North America on February 26, 2008; in Australia on March 13, 2008; and in Europe on March 14, 2008.[3]

The game takes place in an alternate history in which Winston Churchill dies in 1931, eight years before the start of World War II, presenting the possibility of what could have happened to Europe, the United States, and the rest of the world without his leadership. The United Kingdom is subdued by Nazi Germany in 1940, and the rest of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East fall soon afterward. The United States, infected with anti-war sentiment, does not get involved overseas. The game takes place in the midst of the Greater German Reich's invasion and occupation of the East Coast of the United States in 1953.[4]</desc>

		<name>Turok</name>
		<desc>Turok is a first-person shooter developed by Propaganda Games, and published by Touchstone Games and Disney Interactive Studios, originally for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in February 2008. It was later ported on to Microsoft Windows in April 2008. A sequel was planned and developed for the Xbox 360 but it was cancelled before it was even officially announced.

The game is loosely based on the comic book series of the same title and is unrelated to the story and setting of previous Turok video games. Players assume the role of Native American space marine Joseph Turok, who is part of a team sent to a remote planet to apprehend his previous commanding officer, General Roland Kane, now a wanted war criminal. After crash landing, Turok discovers this planet is home to all manner of dinosaurs, and must fight both the predatory creatures and Kane's private army on his mission to take down his former mentor.</desc>

		<name>Two Worlds</name>
		<desc>The game takes place in a real-time three-dimensional fantasy landscape. As such it has drawn comparison with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

Much like in Oblivion and Gothic 3, the gameplay is non-linear. The player is free to explore the game world, accepting side quests at will. There is however, a core quest, centering around rescuing the protagonist's sister, who is being held for ransom by mysterious forces who are scheming to open the tomb of Aziraal, the god of fire.

The game does not utilize fixed character classes like other role-playing games. As the character gains experience and levels, it is possible to invest gained Attribute Points into any attribute, leading to a variety of game play styles and approaches.

The world in which the game takes place is called Antaloor. While traveling through the game the player will encounter new teleports, caves, villages, and other locations, and these travels are recorded by the in-game mini-map. Teleports allow rapid travel between explored regions. Horses are available for the player to ride as well as other animals/creatures, though a number of commentators have lamented the clumsy controls when mounted.

Death in the game leads to resurrection at a nearby shrine; these shrines are distributed across the game world, and also replenish health when the player comes in sufficient proximity.
There are various creatures in Two Worlds. Unlike other CRPGs with wilderness areas, enemies will not respawn, although most areas are densely populated.

Beyond the main quest there is no set storyline to follow, the player is free to choose to complete the quests of his/her liking, and explore at will. The player may choose to act as a righteous hero and be honored amongst the population, or devilishly evil and feared, through reputation gained by completing certain quests. However, the path chosen will have consequences on the outcome of the game.</desc>

		<name>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds</name>
		<desc>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds is a crossover fighting game developed by Capcom in collaboration with Eighting. The game features characters from both Capcom's video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in February 2011. It is the fifth installment of the Marvel vs. Capcom franchise and the first to use three-dimensional character models instead of sprites.

In Marvel vs. Capcom 3, players select a team of three characters to engage in combat and attempt to knock out their opponents. It features similar tag team game mechanics to earlier games in the series, along with new methods of play designed to make the game more accessible to new players. The game was produced by Ryota Niitsuma, who had previously worked on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, which utilizes the same simplified three-button attack system.

The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and character roster, while criticizing its online component and lack of features and game modes. More than 2 million units were shipped worldwide a month after its debut, rendering it a commercial success. Less than a year after its release, Capcom announced an updated version of the game, titled Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The standalone update was released in November 2011, and featured additional characters, stages, and gameplay tweaks.</desc>

		<desc>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 (Japanese: ??????? ???? VS. ????3 Hepburn: Arutimetto M?vuru b?sasu Kapukon Sur??) is a crossover fighting game developed by Capcom in collaboration with Eighting. It is an updated version of Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. The game features characters from both Capcom's video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics. The game was released in November 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and was featured as a launch title for the PlayStation Vita in 2012.

In Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, players select a team of three characters to engage in combat and attempt to knock out their opponents. As an update, the game utilizes largely identical gameplay mechanics to the original. However, both the aerial combat and X-Factor systems, introduced in Fate of Two Worlds, have received adjustments. In addition to gameplay modifications and new playable characters, the game features several aesthetic changes.

After the events of the 2011 T?hoku earthquake and tsunami disrupted the development schedule for downloadable content for Fate of Two Worlds, the additional content was created into a standalone title, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, for a discounted retail price. The game received generally positive reviews upon release; critics praised the expanded character roster and improved online experience, but criticized the lack of new features and game modes.</desc>

		<name>Ultra Street Fighter IV</name>
		<desc>Ultra Street Fighter 4 includes Edition Select, which lets you pick from the various versions of the characters from all the games released in the Street Fighter 4 series.

At character select, you can pick the version of the fighter from SF4, SSF4, SSF4AE, SSF4 AE Ver. 2012 and Ultra Street Fighter 4.

This means, of course, that vanilla Sagat, who was nerfed by later versions of the game, can go up against the rebalanced characters from Ultra.

"In all the years that I've been playing through the SF4 series, I can't count how many times discussions on 'who the strongest character has been thus far' have come up among players both old and new," Capcom's Peter Rosas, himself a former tournament player, wrote on Capcom Unity.

"Seeing of how there was no actual way to measure whether vanilla SF4 Sagat was stronger than AE Yun, players would engage in long theoretical discussions with no way to figure out who was right. Well, time to change that in Ultra SF!"

There are a couple of ways to get Ultra, due out in June on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in August on PC.

If you have Super Street Fighter 4 or Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition you can download Ultra Street Fighter 4 as a £10.99 / €14.99 / $14.99 digital upgrade for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in early June. The PC digital upgrade and the PC full digital bundle will both be available in August 2014.

Also in August the PS3 and Xbox 360 retail versions and full download version of the game will be released for £29.99 / €39.99 / $39.99. If you buy the PS3 or Xbox 360 retail version, or PS3, Xbox 360 or PC full digital bundle you get all previously-released costumes for the series.</desc>

It is published by Midway Games, and was released for Microsoft Windows on November 19, 2007, PlayStation 3 on December 11, 2007, and Xbox 360 on July 3, 2008. The Linux and Mac OS X versions of the game were planned to be released as downloadable installers that work with the retail disc. Ryan C. Gordon has uploaded screenshots of the game, dating from September 2008, running on both platforms.[1][2] On May 22, 2009, Ryan stated that the UT3 port for Linux was still in process.[3] On December 16, 2010, Steve Polge announced that the Linux port would never be released, making it the first Unreal Tournament game not to be released on Linux.[4]

Unreal Tournament 3 is the fourth game in the Unreal Tournament series and the eighth Unreal game, but is numbered in terms of the engine it runs on. The original Unreal Tournament uses the first Unreal Engine, while UT2003 and UT2004 use Unreal Engine 2. Since 2004 incorporates all of the content from 2003, they are regarded as part of the same generation. UT3 is the third generation, as it runs on Unreal Engine 3, and does not reuse any content.[5] In March 2008, Midway announced that UT3 had sold over a million copies worldwide.[6]

On May 8, 2014, Epic Games announced a new, free and crowdsourced Unreal Tournament title.[7][8]</desc>

		<name>Vancouver 2010</name>
		<desc>Vancouver 2010 is the officially licensed game based on the Winter Olympics 2010. It offers 14 disciplines: Alpine Skiing (four variants), bobsled, freestyle-skiing (two variants), luge, speed skating (two variants), skeleton, ski jumping and snowboard (two variants). These disciplines can be played only individually (training or championship); there is no linking element. The player has also no ways to individualize his athlete besides choosing between one of about 20 nationalities; his look and gender is set for the disciplines, e.g. the luge is only for men. 

The controls depend on rhythmical movements with the input device, e.g. during the bobsled championship the player has to mimic the movements of the both men. Besides these disciplines there are also 30 challenges where the player has to solve certain tasks, e.g. keeping a certain speed or skiing around snowmen.

The license only apples to the game's name: there are no real athletes or voice commentary. There is one course per discipline.</desc>

The United States of America has attempted to alleviate its own energy problems by launching an O'Neill Cylinder space station harboring a solar energy-driven generator to provide them with an alternative source of fuel from the sun. However, the government of the Russian Federation on Earth has been overthrown in a coup d'état by ultra-nationalist forces calling themselves the Order of the Russian Star.
Russian forces capture this space station and divert its harvested solar energy into a blast wave that devastates San Francisco, aiming to force the U.S. into a total and unconditional surrender.

		<desc>Death's daughter, Scarlett, journeys into the heart of 16th century Venice to stop an evil necromancer and his undead underlings in this action/role-playing game from German developer Deck 13. Scarlett can equip axes, swords, war hammers, and other weapons to slay her enemies. Combat involves pressing a button to swing, and then timing subsequent button presses to string together powerful combos. Scarlett can also enter a spirit world at any time to move without being seen as well as communicate with the dead. The action takes place predominately within Venice, as players explore the city's five districts and underground catacombs in search of ways to reach her tyrannical target. As she defeats enemies, Scarlett will earn skill points that can be spent on various magic and melee techniques taught by skill trainers. These abilities allow Scarlett to block with specific weapon types, perform longer chain attacks, cast life-stealing spells, and more.</desc>

		<desc>Virtua Fighter 5 features an all-star cast of 17 fighters, including characters from the previous iterations along with two new characters named El Blaze and Eileen. El Blaze is a Mexican fighting champion who defeats opponents with his quick Lucha Libre fighting style. Eileen, originally from China, uses a Monkey Kung-Fu fighting style that she learned from her grandfather, a former Kung-Fu master. 

Players are able to customize their characters by selecting from four uniquely patterned costumes and a wide range of attachable items that can be placed onto each fighter’s various body parts. Virtua Fighter 5 delivers fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping action as players head into battle, taking on a host of popular characters. Players not only achieve victory by defeating highly-skilled opponents, but also by competing for prizes which earn them in-game money allowing them to buy many items at in-game shop. These items allow players to customize their ultimate warrior and become the top Virtua Fighter. 

In addition, the game introduces "Offensive Move", a new maneuver that allows players to easily approach opponents from the side, adding a more strategic element to the battle</desc>

		<desc>That rotten Professor Pester and his Ruffians have snuck into Piñata Central, and in a botched attempt to steal all the Piñata records, they've ended up erasing them all instead! It's up to you to help restore the records, and keep those candy-filled piñatas coming!

Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise is the sequel to Rare's gardening simulator, Viva Piñata. The overall game remains the same - lure piñata by tending your garden. Some animals are attracted by the appearance of others, while others will come because of the types of plants that you grow. As you progress, the more valuable your garden will become - and that means that Professor Pester and his Ruffians will turn up to try to vandalize it, either causing fights with piñata, or smashing your most expensive object.

Trouble in Paradise includes all the piñata from the original game, as well as some new species that can only be found by traveling to the Dessert Desert or the Piñarctic. These piñata are wild, and need to be lured with bait and caught. Unfortunately, new Sour Piñata are also waiting to come in and cause problems for you as well.

A new feature of the game is Piñata Vision, which uses the Xbox Live Vision Camera to scan in cards. These cards can drop in an assortment of items into the game - anything from new piñata, to garden objects, to tools - even shop discounts! Players can even take a photo of an object in their garden and transform it into a Piñata Vision card to send to a friend. The game also features two mini-games - a Piñata racing game, and Piñata contest game. Winning these mini-games increases your piñata's value.</desc>

		<name>Watch Dogs</name>
		<desc>The storyline of Watch Dogs game is built around the concept of information warfare, data being interconnected, and the world's increasing use of technology—questioning who exactly runs the computers they depend on. The game is set in an alternate reality version of Chicago, Illinois, which is one of many cities to feature a supercomputer known as a "CtOS" (Central Operating System). The system controls almost every piece of technology in the city, and contains information on all of the city's residents and activities which can be used for various purposes. In the game's universe, the Northeast blackout of 2003 was found to be caused by a hacker, prompting the development of CtOS. The game will follow a man named Aiden Pearce, a highly skilled hacker described as a person who uses both "fists and wits." The gameplay demo shown at E3 2012 depicted Aiden's attempt to assassinate a media mogul named Joseph DeMarco, who had been wrongly acquitted on charges of murder. In a demonstration shown at E3 2013, Pearce helps a fellow hacker named T-Bone escape after he is discovered attempting to steal a motherboard.</desc>

		<name>Wet</name>
		<desc>Rubi Malone calls herself a problem solver. Others would call her a mercenary. For enough money she does what she's told without asking questions and going over corpses to reach her goals. But one day a guy called Robert Pelham has the guts to double-cross her - a huge mistake. Mad as hell she goes out on a search for vengeance, traveling over several continents and going through hordes and hordes of minions. The whole game is envisioned like a Grindhouse movie with scratches all over the screen, missing scenes, a high amount of blood and gore and a high focus on staged action scenes.

Similar to John Woo presents Stranglehold, WET is a third-person-shooter with a strong focus on acrobatic stunts. While Rubi can kill enemies with her assortment of four different types of weapons (two pistols with unlimited ammo, two shotguns, two machine pistols and two crossbows) just by walking around shooting, she doesn't do much damage that way and is very slow. Instead she needs to jump around, slide across the floor or walk on the walls which instantly slows down time until she touches the floor again. During these moves she can also use both of her weapons to target one enemy automatically while manually using the crosshair to target another. For every kill she makes she gets points and depending on how fast and how "stylish" she kills enemies, her points multiplier increases up to x5. The multiplier is especially important, since Rubi only regenerates health when the multiplier is active, making her nearly invulnerable once she reaches and successfully holds x5. The only other way to regenerate health is to drink from whiskey bottles scattered around the levels. Earned points are used to buy new moves or upgrade existing ones as well as her weapons. She also has access to a sword which she uses as a door-opener and to cut down enemies in melee combat.

Besides the normal combat and the action/adventure-like climbing and jumping exercises in-between, there are simple quick-time events for bossfights and other scripted events and the so-called Rage-mode. At certain, pre-defined points in the game, Rubi kills an enemy at close range and gets blood all over her face. This drives her mad and turns the realistic graphics into a red-black-white cartoon-style world. During rage-mode, Rubi is nearly invulnerable, is faster and hits harder - but also has to deal with many many more enemies. Once the player has finished the game, additional difficulty settings are unlocked including an arcade-mode where each enemy can only take one bullet and Rubi also has considerably less health. In addition a points-mode, in which the player can select each level of the story-mode and try to beat their highscore, and Rubi's home are unlocked. At Rubi's home, an abandoned plane-graveyard, several different challenges await the player like getting from A to B in the fastest time possible, or shooting targets for points.</desc>

		<desc>Gameplay[edit]
The game is set in an open world environment modeled after Barcelona, full of destructible objects, alleyways, shortcuts through office blocks and a total of 31 story missions and 105 side missions. While most missions are driving-oriented, there are also foot missions which are played from a third person perspective. A wide variety of weapons are available to the player, such as pistols and RPGs.

Among the vehicles used by Milo Burik in the game is the Pontiac G8,[2] shown in released trailers for Wheelman. Reports[3] also indicated that the Opel Astra is a drivable vehicle. In the demo, his license plate says MRTL KM8T which is a reference to Mortal Kombat, Midway's popular fighting game.</desc>

		<name>Wolfenstein</name>
		<desc>In the beginning, a Nazi naval officer and a group of German sailors on board the battleship Tirpitz have been tricked into thinking B.J. Blazkowitz is the general after donning the general's hat, boots, and jacket. After seeing blood dripping from the edge of the jacket, the sailors realize that there's a spy on board who has killed the actual general. As Blazkowitz fights the men on board he's forced to surrender by an officer, who orders him to show him the glowing object hidden in the jacket. 

He finds a mysterious medallion in the general's jacket and the officer orders the men to kill him, but he accidentally pushed the trigger which projects a shield over him that reflects the bullets back at the men, creating a cosmic energy wave that melts the men and officer. Hijacking a plane from a German airman, he escapes off the exploding Tirpitz and returns back to the OSA headquarters. During a meeting at OSA headquarters, he learns that the medallion needs crystals called Nachtsonne (found only in Isenstadt) to make use of its full power. The Nazis have begun digging for crystals, led by a Nazi general named Victor Zetta. Blazkowicz is sent to Isenstadt, but his cover is blown by an unknown informant. He then meets up with agents from the Kreisau Circle, and with them, makes it to Isenstadt.</desc>

		<desc>WWE '13 is an upcoming professional wrestling video game being developed by Yuke's and published by THQ for the PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360.[1] It will be the second game in the WWE series and the fifteenth overall in the combined series. It is the sequel to WWE '12, and will be released on October 30, 2012 in North America and November 2, 2012 in United Kingdom.[2]

The game focuses on the Attitude Era of the WWF, replacing its Road to WrestleMania Mode with an Attitude Era Mode where the player plays through the Attitude Era. The game gives such characters as Stone Cold Steve Austin and elements as the Monday Night Wars a more important role in the game than in any previous WWE game.[3]</desc>
