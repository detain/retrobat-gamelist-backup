		<name>Assassin's Creed</name>
		<desc>In the year 2012, a seemingly ordinary bartender named Desmond Miles is abducted by a mysterious organization. The captors attach Desmond to a strange device called "Animus", which allows him to access the memory of his ancestor, an assassin named Altaïr. For some reason, the reconstruction of Altaïr's memories is vital to the captors.

After accessing Altaïr's memory, Desmond is able to experience the events that took place in the Holy Land in the year 1191, the time of the Third Crusade. Al Mualim, the leader of the assassins, orders Altaïr to kill nine prominent historical figures, who supposedly let war and corruption take over the Holy Land.

During most of the game, the player controls Altaïr; however, it is clearly indicated that controlling him is a part of Desmond's experience. The player is also able to control Desmond between his sessions in the "Animus".</desc>

		<desc>In YAIBA: NINJA GAIDEN Z, players will battle fierce zombies as Yaiba, a cyborg ninja who will do anything to get revenge and stay alive. Cleaved in two, he is brought back to life with cyber technology. Brandishing his ninja sword and the mecha weapons in his cyborg arm, he slaughters zombies with brutal, over the top abandon. Step into a stylized living comic book where stunning graphics depict a world gone mad. Hordes of undead can only be stopped by Yaiba's willingness to use any means necessary to get the job done. Will he kill by turning his cyborg arm into a razor chainsaw for slicing up undead or just rip off an opponent's arms to use as zombie nun chucks. Both possibilities fill Yaiba's heart with twisted laughter in this upcoming collaboration between famed developers Team NINJA and concept's Keiji Inafune.</desc>

		<name>Backyard Sports: Sandlot Sluggers</name>
		<desc>Backyard Sports is a series of video games released for both consoles and computers. The series is best known for starring kid-sized versions of popular professional sports stars, such as Albert Pujols, Paul Pierce, Barry Bonds, Tim Duncan, Clint Mathis, Kevin Garnett, Tom Brady, Alex Rodriguez, Joe Thornton and Andy Macdonald. The Backyard Sports series is licensed by the leading professional US sports leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLS).

The series includes Backyard Baseball, Backyard Basketball, Backyard Football (American football), Backyard Soccer, Backyard Hockey (Ice hockey), and Backyard Skateboarding. In the games, players form a team consisting of Backyard Kids and pro players, which they take through a "Backyard League" season, attempting to become the champions. Players can create their own athletes, starting in Backyard Football (1999). Another aspect of the games is the use of Power-Ups, allowing players to gain "super-abilities." For instance, "Super Dunk" allows a basketball player to make an incredible dunk from nearly anywhere on the court, "Leap Frog" allows a football player to jump over the entire defensive line, and "Ice Cream Truck" causes the other team to be completely distracted for a brief period of time.

Some of these games are playable with the ScummVM emulator.[1]</desc>

		<name>Binary Domain</name>
		<desc>Binary Domain is an original squad-based shooter by Toshihiro Nagoshi, the creator behind some of Sega's most well-known video game franchises, including the critically acclaimed Yakuza series. Campaign play in Binary Domain features a trust based system in which the maintenance of relationships developed with AI squadmates are crucial if they are to follow orders. The game also features full destructible robot enemies, a wide range of weapons and a robust range of online multiplayer options. 

Binary Domain puts players in the middle of a fast paced and intense battle for humanity against androids called the "Hallow Children" in 2080 Tokyo. Fighting through the derelict lower levels of the city, players control an international peacekeeping squad that soon starts to question their surroundings and the choices they make, especially as they realize that the androids appear to think that they are human and they witness the dramatic divisions within society. In the face of this struggle the question becomes, are these these robots becoming more human, or are humans becoming more like machines? 

Players assume the role of Dan Marshall, the leader of a multinational squad of commandos known as the "Rust Crew." The different characters of the squad each have different skills and personalities which must be exploited. Players are always Dan, but also command all other squad members, communicating with them either through a headset or via their controller. As players progress through the game they build dynamic relationships with AI squadmates based on the overarching cause and effect component of the game known as the Consequence system. Within the Consequence system, the player's actions determine the amount of trust each squadmate has in Dan. The Consequence system also affects the way that the campaign of the story plays out, with the use of different characters in different situations influencing events and outcomes.</desc>

Like previous BioShock games, the player uses a combination of weapons, clothing called Gear that offer unique attributes, and psychokinetic powers granted through Vigors. Elizabeth's powers can also be used to help fight hostile forces. In contrast to the limited spaces of the underwater city of Rapture, the openness of Columbia provides for more dynamic combat, including combat that takes place aboard the city's Sky-Line rollercoaster-like rail system.</desc>

		<desc>You are a mercenary possessed by a flame demon in a desperate world ravaged by seven Ice Lords and their Dead-Army. 

In this RPG where all your choices lead to consequences, you will have to choose between unleashing the powers of the beast within and rejecting the demonic influence that wants to claim your humanity.

Freely develop your abilities and combat style through three skill trees: swing the heavy weapons of the Fighter, wield the sneaky dual daggers of the Ranger, or use the devastating flame spells of the Pyromancer.

Recruit companions who will live, love, hate and fight alongside you against the dreadful creatures of Vertiel, in real-time epic battles based on tactics and reaction.

The bigger the danger, the greater the temptation to draw on the demon’s power at the cost of your soul… which way will YOU choose?</desc>

		<name>Bullet Witch</name>
		<desc>At first, we thought she was one of them - a woman in black, with a long gun like a witch's broom and the magical powers to match. Survivors whispered her stories in the alleyways: stories of battles so intense that they leveled whole city blocks, during which she mowed down entire demon regiments with flaming bullets, then shared her own blood to save the wounded. They say she can summon clouds of ravens, call up thorns from the ground, and even conjure up lightning and tornadoes at will. 

Maybe she flew down from Heaven. Maybe Hell spat her back out. Either way, she's all we've got. 

Bullet Witch is set on a bleak Earth, in the year 2013. The human race is almost extinct as hideous demons and monsters dominate the planet. It's been decided that only a combination of ancient and modern combat can beat the creatures. Alicia is a highly-trained soldier who also knows ancient magic. The fate of the human race is in her hands as she ventures into the world of monsters and fights them with her mix of magical arts and military equipment. Manage Alicia's health &amp; magic meters to avoid running out of ammo or power - be strategic &amp; play it safe, or the world dies with her.</desc>

		<desc>Xbox 360 players can experience the full adventure of Blizzard’s epic action RPG, Diablo III, as the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition includes the expansion pack Reaper of Souls! Bringing the world of Diablo back to Xboxgamers, this edition of Diablo III features special four-player co-op features. With the wireless controller and a custom-designed console interface, players will be outfitted with touch pad functionality and new social features as they engage in pulse-pounding combat with hordes of monsters and acquire items of incredible power.

Diablo III picks up the story twenty years after the events of Diablo II. Mephisto, Diablo, and Baal have been defeated, but the Worldstone, which once shielded the inhabitants of the world of Sanctuary from the forces of both Heaven and Hell, has been destroyed, and evil once again stirs in Tristram. Take on the role of one of six powerful character classes -- Barbarian, Demon Hunter, Monk, Witch Doctor, Wizard, or the all-new Crusader -- and embark on a dark journey through Acts I-V to save the world of Sanctuary from ancient and sinister forces. Players will acquire powerful items, spells, and abilities as they explore new and familiar areas of Sanctuary and battle hordes of demons to safeguard the world from the horrors that have arisen.</desc>

		<desc>Codemasters' acclaimed off-road racing series continues with Dirt 2, which offers enhanced visuals, controls, and play mechanics over its power-sliding predecessor. A revamped single-player mode finds you starting out in the humble confines of an RV, where you'll begin your racing career. It's there where you'll meet driver Travis Pastrana, who gives you the keys to the late Colin McRae's blue Subaru and sends you on your way. You'll then compete in various locales around the world, from Los Angeles to Malaysia, interacting with such real-life drivers as Ken Block, Dave Mirra, and Tanner Faust while entering over 100 events designed to put your driving skills to the test. Earn upgrades to McRae's Subaru or acquire new cars along the way. Each event is geared toward a specific style of off-road racing, from Rallycross and Trailblazer to Landrush and Raid. Up to eight players can also compete online in any of the available game modes.</desc>

		<name>DoDonPachi Resurrection: Deluxe Edition</name>
		<desc>After the turmoil caused by the assault on Lunapolis which sparked the "Blissful Death Wars" (as depicted in DoDonPachi Dai-Ou-Jou), peace seems to have been restored, with the legendary DonPachi Corps retreating to its HQ in a space-time fold. Six years later, anomalies are detected in the space-time fabric, yet tests reveal nothing out of order, with the portals regularly functioning for both teleportation and time travel; also, the leader of the DonPachi squadron Colonel Godwin Longhener dismisses the matter due to the lack of actual danger.

Nevertheless, a technician delves deeper into the anomaly, discovering that something has infiltrated the HQ computer systems and is using the portals to send large quantities of materials and data to the past, spreading out like a virus and quickly evolving. In an ironic twist, the virus is discovered to be the program originally installed in the Element Dolls six years ago, now reaching beyond the DonPachi Corps programming and seeking to annihilate the human race in retaliation for their "enslavement" (after the war, they met a rather cruel demise at the hand of their own human creators) by waging war in the past rather than in the present: unsettled, the Colonel authorizes the last transport ship to time jump in order to fight back the invasion before future changes. However, he states: "Start over from the past... I never thought of that", echoing the ideas of mankind's imperfection which has always been a recurring theme in the series.

And once again, the three pilots jump back in time to 2008 and enter the fray, the transport ship being targeted as soon as it exits the portal: the Element Daughters, gigantic evolutions of the Dolls, are awaiting...

The bee is still humming.</desc>

		<name>Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard</name>
		<desc>Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard is a third-person shooter video game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 video game consoles. The game was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and published by D3 Publisher.

Eat Lead pits players in the role of the title character, a "legendary" gaming hero who is "returning to glory" in a new video game, some 25 years after his debut game and 6 years after his last game. In reality, the Matt Hazard character is in his first video game, with a history made up by D3 Publisher to chronicle the character's rise and fall in popularity. The Return of Matt Hazard marks Hazard's fictitious "comeback" to the gaming scene. Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace "Wally" Wellesley.

The game itself is a parody of action-gaming clichés. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard's successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles.[1]

The cast of Eat Lead received a nomination in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, under the category for "Best Cast"</desc>

		<name>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</name>
		<desc>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is an action-adventure platform video game developed by Ninja Theory and published by Namco Bandai Games. It was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 5, October 7 and October 8, 2010 in North America, Australia, Japan and Europe respectively.[1][2] A premium version, featuring all DLC content, was made for Microsoft Windows and Sony Playstation 3 and was later released on October 25, 2013.

The story is a re-imagining of the novel Journey to the West written by Wu Cheng'en. Unlike the original story that was set in a fantastical version of ancient China, the game is set 150 years in a future post-apocalyptic world following a global war, with only remnants of humanity left, along with the still active war machines left over from the conflict. Like the original story however, the plot revolves around someone who forces the help and protection of a warrior, with many characters sharing the same names and roles. The game's story was written by Alex Garland, with voice talent and motion capture from Andy Serkis and Lindsey Shaw.</desc>

		<desc>Escape Dead Island is an adventure survival horror video game developed by Swedish developer Fatshark and published by German studio Deep Silver. This is the first Dead island game in the series that is a spin-off. On August 27, 2014, Deep Silver revealed that access to a beta version of Dead Island 2, the third main entries of the series, will be available for those who pre-order Escape Dead Island on any of the platforms.[2]

The game is a survival mystery that follows the story of Cliff Calo, who sets sail to document the unexplained events rumored to have happened on Banoi. Arriving on the island of Narapela, part of the Banoi archipelago, he finds that not everything is as it seems. Haunted by deja-vus, Cliff will have to make sense of it all. This story-driven adventure lets players delve into the Dead Island universe and unravel the origins of the zombie outbreak.</desc>

		<name>Eschatos</name>
		<desc>Eschatos takes place in the 22nd century where a mysterious organic alien matter - known only as the Purple Erosion - has taken over The Moon. After covering 75% of The Moon's surface, the aliens launch an attack on the Earth using flying saucers to deploy trajectory weapons and ships. The player is tasked with stopping the invasion using a fighter ship capable of great attack and defense technology.
The ship has two modes of fire: the long range Front Shot and the short range Wide Shot. The ship features a regenerative shield capable of absorbing enemy bullets, but with overuse can deteriorate. The game has three game modes including Original, Advanced and Time Attack. In Original mode, there are only two pick-up items including 1Ups and the Flash icon which destroys all enemies and enemy shots on-screen. Advanced mode however includes a few more items including an alternate Flash icon and Power Ups. Collecting Power Ups increase player fire power, but decreases shield percentage.

The game spans over six stages that are organized with about four to six Areas per stage. There is a unique timing score utilized in each game (Eschatos, Judgment Silver Sword and Cardinal Sins): a timer is set to count up with every enemy wave and boss encounter. The timer stops once all enemies/bosses are defeated and the score is determined with how quickly each enemy wave/boss was destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>Medal of Honor: Warfighter is a first-person shooter video game developed by Danger Close Games and published by Electronic Arts. It is a direct sequel to 2010's series reboot Medal of Honor and the fourteenth installment in the Medal of Honor series. The title was officially announced on February 23, 2012, and was released in North America on October 23, 2012, in Australia on October 25, 2012, in Europe on October 26, 2012[1] and in Japan on November 15, 2012 on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

The games' single-player campaign picks up where Medal of Honor left off, as it reveals Tier 1 operator Preacher returning home to find his family torn apart from years of deployment. The campaign also reveals that the deadly explosive, PETN, had begun to appear around the globe.

Warfighter was both a critical and commercial failure. Due to the game's failure, EA pulled the Medal of Honor series out of rotatio</desc>

		<name>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</name>
		<desc>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is an action-packed adventure-RPG inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Exploring an original story of vengeance and redemption, the game puts players in the role of Talion, a valiant ranger whose family is slain in front of him the night Sauron and his army return to Mordor -- moments before his own life is taken. Resurrected by a Spirit of vengeance and empowered with Wraith abilities, Talion ventures into Mordor and vows to destroy those who have wronged him. Through the course of his personal vendetta, Talion uncovers the truth of the Spirit that compels him, learns the origins of the Rings of Power and ultimately confronts his true nemesis.

Every enemy that players face is a unique individual, differentiated by their personality, strengths and weaknesses. Through the Nemesis System, enemy relationships and characteristics are shaped by player actions and decisions to create personal archenemies that remember and adapt to the player and are distinct to every gameplay session. Gamers are able to craft their own battles, enemies and rewards within the dynamic world that remembers and adapts to their choices, delivering a unique experience to every player.</desc>

		<name>Mini Ninjas</name>
		<desc>An ancient samurai warlord returns and raises a new demonic army to subdue the world. But instead of hiring unreliable minions he transforms innocent animals into fearsome warriors. A ninja master notices how every transformation destabilizes the balance of nature, causing storms and earthquakes, and decides to send out his best ninja disciples to restore the order. When none of them returns, he is left with his last choice: the young ninja Hiro and his blunt friend Futo. Players control the characters through different worlds using a third-person perspective with a relative amount of freedom to explore the environment. When lost, the characters can meditate to receive a hint and see an arrow that points into the general direction of the next objective.

During the course of the game they will follow the steps of the other warriors and eventually free four of them to make them playable. The player can switch between any character at any given moment. Each ninja has different abilities. Hiro is an allrounder and the only ninja who can use Kuji spells. Unlocked by finding and praying at hidden shrines, spells include fireballs, whirlwinds and the ability to enter a spirit form where animals can be taken over to have them fight. They also make it easier to spot items and collectibles in the environment. Animals are locked up in cages but also appear when an enemy is defeated and they return to their original form. Futo wields a large hammer and is especially useful to engage larger enemies. The other characters that become available during the course of the game are Suzume, a young girl with a flute that enchants enemies when she plays music, Shun, a master with the bow, Tora who thinks he's a tiger and has big metal claws to proof it, and the acrobat Kunoichi with a long spear.

Characters have basic attacks along with a defence breaker to stun enemies and the ability to block. Acrobatic moves include wall jumping, running along walls and hanging from ledges. All characters have a sneak mode where they can hide in the grass or the environment to cause more damage when attacking or to simply avoid confrontations. Health is restored by gathering fruit and there are collectible items in the environments. When new recipes are bought, these items can be mixed into potions, bombs and power-ups. Characters level up to get better abilities and they all have a different focus attack to cause more damage.</desc>

		<desc>MLB Front Office Manager allows a player to take the role of a baseball general manager over the course of a thirty-year career; the goal is to perform well enough to become inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. The player's GM is rated on eight disciplines including North American scouting, international scouting, pro-league scouting, player development, trades, contract negotiation, owner confidence and leadership. GMs also have former career backgrounds (i.e. ex-manager, lawyer, business person, former player, or talent scout) that affect the GM's disciplines. A GM's ratings improve or regress over his career depending on their performance and will have seasonal goals depending on the club they're hired by. The player will be faced with decisions such as spring training evaluation, initiate and respond to trades, develop rookies, and even bid for Japanese baseball players. The game also promises advanced AI-controlled GMs who have unique motivations.</desc>

		<desc>Collecting medals is the primary scoring mechanic in the game. When an enemy is destroyed using the lard attack, they will drop medals shaped like a pig's head. If enemies are destroyed with the lard attack while a bomb is being used, they will drop "p" items instead of medals. Also, Single medals will periodically drop from enemies even if they are not destroyed using the lard attack.
The medal value starts at 100 points. If there are already medals on screen, the medals that enemies drop will be of an equal value to the medals on screen. If there are no medals on screen, the medal value will increase by 100 points (if the previous value was  1000 points), or 1000 points (if the previous value was  1000 points). The medal value will max out at 10,000 points.
If the player switches from the B-shot to the A-shot, all medals on screen will be automatically collected. If the player fails to collect the last medal on screen, the medal value will divide by a factor of 10. The player is awarded an extend every 10 million points. An extend item can also be found if the third stage mid-boss is destroyed using the pierce shot.
Accessing the second loop requires completing the first five stages without losing a single life. If the extend item is collected in stage 3, the player can die once and still proceed to the second loop. Stages 6–10 are identical to the first five stages, but are much more difficult. In addition to this, score extends are no longer awarded.</desc>

		<desc>NASCAR 08 is the eleventh installment of the EA Sports NASCAR series. It was developed by EA Tiburon and released for PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This is the earliest that EA has released a NASCAR game. It also marks the first time the original Xbox has been excluded from the NASCAR lineup since NASCAR 2001.

Tony Stewart is on the cover marking his third appearance on the cover of an EA Sports NASCAR game. The cover in the PAL region features Juan Pablo Montoya. NASCAR's new Car of Tomorrow as well as the current car are present in the game, although the Car of Tomorrow is generic (no separate manufacturers). ESPN's NASCAR coverage is also integrated into the game. Crew chief dialogue for the PS3 and 360 versions of the game was recorded by Chad Knaus. The Whelen Modified Tour is not included in the PS3 and 360 versions of the game, but is still present in the PS2 version.</desc>

Behind the wheel as Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Gordon, or one of a dozen others, players take the power and speed of NASCAR for an off-track joyride. Forgiving physics and accelerated action encourage players to trade paint as they push fearlessly to the front of the pack, while authentic techniques such as drafting or sling-shotting earn an extra boost.</desc>

NBA 2K8 was well received upon release. Critics mostly praised the aesthetical details, with particular praise directed towards the player animations, as well as the game mode options, and overall gameplay, more specifically, the post play, jump shooting, and well rounded accessibility. Most criticisms were concerning some gameplay inconsistencies, such as the defensive mechanics, and the unrealistic player tendencies, as well as the game's lack of improvements, with some seeing the lack of meaningful changes as a step back from NBA 2K7, and visuals, which some saw as "awful" and "ugly". Some saw the visuals as "gorgeous" however</desc>

Tanner and Tobias witness this from Tanner's car, pursuing Jericho as he causes havoc on the streets of the city. Tanner ends up in front of Jericho in an alleyway, and gets pushed in front of a tractor trailer. A hard crash occurs, putting him into a coma. The game will take place in Tanner's coma dream</desc>

		<desc>Need for Speed is going back to its roots and that can mean only one thing: police chases and ridiculously expensive supercars. Hot Pursuit doesn't make any claims to be the most realistic racer out there, even compared to previous games, but it does aim to be the most fun. You can play either as cops or racers, but both sides get ultra powerful cars and a range of power-ups to get them to the race's end. If you're a cop your job is to chase down your quarry using any means necessary, including roadblocks. If you're playing as a racer you'll often be in a slower car than your pursuer, but you won't be tied to any of their rules and get your own powerful power-ups like the radar jammer.</desc>

		<desc>Need for Speed: Most Wanted (also known as Need for Speed: Most Wanted - A Criterion Game; commonly shortened to Most Wanted 2012) is a 2012 open world racing game with nonlinear gameplay, developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts. Announced on 4 June 2012, during EA's E3 press conference, Most Wanted is the nineteenth title in the long-running Need for Speed series and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation Vita, iOS and Android, beginning in North America on 30 October 2012, with a Wii U version following on 14 March 2013 under the title Need for Speed: Most Wanted U.[10] The game picked up on the Most Wanted intellectual property, as opposed to the Hot Pursuit reboot that Criterion developed previously.[12]

Need for Speed: Most Wanted received positive reviews, which focused on the world map that blended the styles of previous Burnout and Need for Speed games, and the social features, while criticism fell on the single-player mode. Following its release, the game won several awards including the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards for Best Driving Game and was nominated for Best British Game and Best Online Multiplayer at the 2013 BAFTA Awards, and was repeatedly recognized as the best driving/racing game of 2012 by several outlets.</desc>

		<name>NHL 13</name>
		<desc>NHL 13 is an ice hockey video game developed by EA Canada published by EA Sports. It is the 22nd installment of the NHL series and was released on September 11, 2012 in North America, Europe as well as Australia and New Zealand. The game was released on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, featuring Philadelphia Flyers forward Claude Giroux on the cover.[1] The game was featured at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012 (E3 2012), which took place between June 5–7, 2012. The demo of the game was released on August 21–22, 2012, at the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store.[4]

There was a vote deciding which player would be on the NHL 13 cover. Anybody could vote on the player(s) they wished to see on the cover of the game. The vote started on March 29, 2012 with 60 NHL players in a single-elimination voting with two players in each match-up, and was closed on June 4, receiving over 25 million votes worldwide.[5] On June 20, Claude Giroux was named the winner, over Pekka Rinne at the 2012 NHL Awards in Las Vegas.[6]

An exclusive "Stanley Cup Collector's Edition" was also released, apart from the actual NHL 13 game. The Collector's Edition includes five random Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) player packs from the two 2012 Stanley Cup Finals teams; a Gold Jumbo HUT pack including legend Wayne Gretzky; and a boost pack featuring the CCM RBZ stick.[7]

Just like in NHL 12, Gary Thorne (play-by-play) and Bill Clement (color) provide commentary for NHL 13.[8]

This year, for the first time, two playable female characters, Hayley Wickenheiser and Angela Ruggiero have been added.[9] In NHL 12, users could create female characters, but there were no real-life players.[10]

On September 20, Gamesindustry.biz reported that NHL 13 had posted the best first week sales in the franchise's history.[11]</desc>

Museum guard-turned entrepreneur Larry Daley discovers that his favorite exhibits, and some of his best friends, from New York's Natural History Museum are being shipped off to the archives at the Smithsonian. Larry gets a distress call from the miniature cowboy, Jedediah, reporting that Egyptian ruler Kahmunrah and a trio of heinous henchmen--namely Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon and Al Capone--are plotting to take over the museum, then the world. Speeding to the nation's capitol, Larry is clearly in over his head. But with some impressive new pals, including the irrepressible Amelia Earhart, along with familiar friends Teddy Roosevelt and Octavius, Larry will stop at nothing to restore the Smithsonian before dawn.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Gaiden 3</name>
		<desc>Ninja Gaiden 3 is the third main game in the series since the reboot in 2004 and once again stars ninja Ryu Hayabusa as the protagonist. The game starts in medias res with Ryu attacking a giant creature through a quick time event. Soon after it is revealed through a flashback that he was contacted by the government because an unknown group launched a terrorist attack in London and took control of the area surrounding the prime minister's residence, taking him hostage. In a video they declare they want Hayabusa handed to them. He travels to London from Japan but has no intention of just surrendering. Later on in the game it is revealed the group behind the attack is a cult of alchemists who want to establish a new world order with Ryu as the catalyst. From London the journey eventually takes him to a city in the Rub' al Khali desert, Abysmo Island in the Indian Ocean, Hayabusa Village in Japan, the Howard Phillips Plains in Antarctica, the Pacific Ocean, and finally back in Tokyo, Japan. The story no longer involves the struggle with Fiends and Archfiends from the previous games.

Just like the other titles in the series gameplay is centered around fast-paced combat with a quick succession of moves to build up combos and fight off multiple enemies at the same time. Moves are performed with a combination of weak and strong attacks. Incoming attacks can be blocked and there is a new slide manoeuvre and a visual camera trick in slow motion when he performs a body-piercing move, along with finishers. Enemies in the air can be attacked using an auto-targeting bow with unlimited ammo and there are also shurikens. The ninja can fly down and attack from the air, use a new technique to climb walls using his kunai with a quick succession of buttons, or sneak up from behind and perform a stealth kill. Many of the opponents are mechanical and equipped with guns. Early in the game he receives an evil curse that fuses his dragon sword into his arm, causing it to pulsate with veins. This makes Ryu feel the pain of each victim as he kills someone. The effect of the curse makes him more powerful or weaker at certain moments in the game. After killing a certain amount of enemies the arm lights up red and he can perform Grip of the Murder to perform a devastating attack. Compared to the earlier games enemies are no longer as deadly efficient in their attacks and Ryu can sustain more damage where an arcade-like approach is often put before strategic and slow fighting.

There is no longer a store and items are few. A few new swords are discovered gradually and arrows for the bow also become stronger. The Ninpo concept from the previous games is still present, but in only one form. Defeating enemies fills up a bar and once it is full Ninpo can be activated to transform into a dragon to kill all enemies in the environment and regain full health. In the multiplayer additional Ninpo are available. The save system with statues has been replaced by checkpoints where a falcon swoops down, also restoring health. The game structure is largely linear, but in larger environments a button can be used to sense the path to follow when stuck.

After completing the first level Shadows of the World is unlocked, the online multiplayer mode which is a first for the series. It offers cooperative challenges and online deathmatch games for up to eight players simultaneously. Progress is persistent and the experience while fighting is used to unlock new tools and abilities permanently for the character. The PlayStation 3 version is compatible with the Move peripheral for controlling and guiding the attacks.</desc>

The original cast of characters from Persona 3 and 4 are back to discover the mastermind behind the whole tournament, while a few new faces join the fight, including Junpei Iori, Yukari Takeba, Rise Kujikawa, and more. But standing in their way is the dual katana-wielding Sho Minazuki, a huge threat to everyone involved in the P-1 Climax. Worse yet, there's a Sho lookalike who can wield a Persona...</desc>

		<name>Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection</name>
		<desc>Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection faithfully recreates eight of the most memorable tables from the golden age of pinball in photorealistic 3D. Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced "Magna-Save" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.</desc>

		<desc>Power Gig: Rise of the SixString is a rhythm game developed by Seven45 Studios, a sister company of First Act which produces low-cost, entry-level musical instruments.[1] While the game is similar to guitar-based games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, Power Gig ships with a unique guitar game controller that acts as both a standalone six-stringed guitar and game controller with note-matching games. Because of the nearness of the controller and gameplay to that of a real guitar, it has attracted musicians including Eric Clapton, Dave Matthews, and Kid Rock that have shied away from music games before due to the simplicity of the button-mashing concept. The game is also distributed with the AirStrike, a drum controller that works on motion sensing. The game was shipped on October 19, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</desc>

		<desc>War in the North is an action role-playing hack and slash game played from a third-person perspective. The game features three playable characters; Eradan (a Ranger), Farin (a Dwarf) and Andriel (an Elf). When the player begins the game for the first time, they must chose which character to control. However, they can switch characters during a single play-through either by using the "switch character" option at the end of each level, or by loading a previously saved game and selecting a different character at the character select screen. Each character has their own unique weaponry, attacks, skills and special abilities. Eradan can use a bow, a two-handed sword, a one-handed sword and a shield, or two single-handed weapons. His skill tree is built around stealth.[4][5] His special ability allows him to find the tracks of other Rangers and follow them to secret stashes of items and weapons.[6] Farin can use two-handed heavy weapons such as axes, a single-handed weapon and a shield, or a crossbow. His skill tree is built around melee combat.[7][8] His special ability allows him to detect fissures and weakness in walls and rocks, smashing them open to find money, items and gems.[6] Andriel can use a staff and a shield, or a staff and a single-handed weapon. Her staff also serves as her long-range weapon. Her skill tree is built around offensive and defensive spell casting.[8][9] She can also create potions from alchemy ingredients collected in the field, and her special ability allows her to find secret passages marked with hidden elven glyphs.[6]</desc>

		<path>./Games/The Price Is Right Decades [NTSCU].iso</path>
		<name>The Price Is Right: Decades</name>
		<desc>The Price is Right: Decades is a video game based on the popular TV show "The Price is Right". It is the third "Price is Right" video game developed by Ludia Inc. for Wii and the first for Xbox 360, but the very first to allow players to play as their Mii characters/Xbox Avatars instead of Ludia avatars. It is also the first game of the series that is completely rendered in 3D.

The game starts in a backstage lounge, where the player is asked to help the lovely Jessica, one of the "beauties" from the show, to go through a series of "The Price is Right" VHS tapes. Jessica will put the tapes in the VCR and the player will be transported into the show, where he/she will bid on several items and compete against other players to win fabulous prizes and money.

In single player mode, the player will first go to Contestants' Row and bid on the selected item against 3 NPCs. If the player's bid is the closest to that item's retail price, without going over, he/she will then go on to play a pricing game. The player will then go to the Showcase Showdown to spin the wheel. If the player beats the NPC's best score while spinning the wheel (by landing on the highest number, without going over 1$), he or she will then go to the Showcase, just like on the TV show.

In multiplayer mode, up to four players can compete against each other on Contestants' Row, pricing games, Showcase Showdown and the Showcase. The player with the most money wins.

The Price is Right: Decades features pricing games from four different decades; the 70s, the 80s, the 90s and the 2000s decade. Each decade's set from the TV show has been faithfully recreated in 3D. There is one pricing game for every year the show has been on air, up until the year 2010. Among the included pricing games are Professor Price, Plinko, Hole in One, Golden Road, Spelling Bee, Rat Race, Pathfinder, and many others. The Xbox 360 version is also compatible with Kinect and features an online mode.</desc>

Areas which are heavily controlled by the Nazis are represented in black and white, with the exception of the irises of characters' eyes, city lights, blue symbols of the French Resistance, and various German symbols, which are bright red and complete with swastikas. In order to make that district colored ("inspired") again, players must weaken the German forces occupying the area. In doing so, that district's citizens regain their hope, visually represented by making the area vibrant and full of color. This also affects gameplay; in black and white areas, German soldiers are present in large numbers, making it far more likely that Sean will be detected in his rebellious activities.</desc>

		<name>The Testament of Sherlock Holmes</name>
		<desc>The tables are turned on fiction's greatest detective as he becomes the focus of an investigation into crimes that include blackmail, destruction of evidence, and even murder in The Testament of Sherlock Holmes. Set in London in 1898, players take on the role of Holmes as he retrieves a priceless set of jewels, only to be accused of replacing them with cheap imitations. With evidence mounting, the city begins to lose faith in the detective, and gamers must prove his innocence by examining crime scenes, collecting evidence, questioning suspects, and using his famed deduction skills.

Xbox 360 gamers can switch between first- and third-person views as they explore the city freely, choosing which leads to follow and which to ignore, and even reenacting crimes to determine a suspect's guilt or innocence. Things are never quite what they seem, though, and as Sherlock's behavior gets increasingly erratic, players take on the role of his trusty sidekick Doctor Watson and try to determine if Holmes is capable of the crimes for which he has been accused.</desc>

		<name>Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X</name>
		<desc>Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X is a 2009 arcade flight video game developed by Ubisoft Romania and published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and by Gameloft for BlackBerry PlayBook, iOS, Palm Pre, Android and Symbian^3. It was released for Xbox and PlayStation in North America on March 3, 2009,[1][2] for Windows on March 17,[3] for iOS on December 9,[4] for BlackBerry on January 8, 2010,[5] for Palm Pre on April 2,[6] for Android on September 13,[7] and for Symbian on January 16, 2011.[8] A Wii version was announced, but was ultimately canceled.[9] In September 2010, a sequel titled Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X 2 was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The Microsoft Windows and Wii versions were released in November 2010.

The story of the game takes place during the time of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2. H.A.W.X is set in the near future where private military companies have essentially replaced government-run military in many countries. The player is placed in the shoes of David Crenshaw; an elite ex-United States Air Force pilot who was recruited by one of these corporations, fighting whomever and whenever he is told to. Crenshaw later returns to the Air Force together with his team, trying to prevent the PMC from initiating a full-scale attack on the United States.

H.A.W.X received mixed reviews from critics.</desc>

		<name>Transformers: The Game</name>
		<desc>Transformers: The Game is the name of multiple versions of a video game based on the 2007 live action film Transformers, all of which were released in North America in June 2007. Home console and PC versions were developed by Traveller's Tales for the PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3 and PC. A different PlayStation Portable version was developed by Savage Entertainment.

Transformers Autobots and Transformers Decepticons are the Nintendo DS versions of Transfomers: The Game. Vicarious Visions, who was tasked with bringing the adaptation to the Nintendo DS, chose to adapt the DS version into two separate games.[1] Autobots follows the heroes' perspective while Decepticons follows the villains'. Unlike games with multiple SKUs such as Pokémon which feature only minor differences between versions, these are two separate games, sharing some basic similarities, but with unique characters, missions and locations.[2]</desc>

		<path>./Games/Transformers Devastation [RF].iso</path>
		<name>Transformers: Devastation</name>
		<desc>Transformers: Devastation is an action game based on the Transformers franchise, specifically the original cartoon series from the 1980s now known as Generation 1. It has the same bright visual style using cel-shaded graphics. The main story mode has five difficulty levels and tells how the Decepticons plan to cyberform planet Earth after Megatron finds a way to control plasma energy. He uses this technique to turn organic material into metal. The Autobots need to prevent this and eventually five different characters are playable: Bumblebee, Grimlock, Optimus Prime, Sideswipe and Wheeljack. Next to the main story mode there is a challenge mode.

The gameplay is similar to other titles by developer Platinum Games. The game is largely played as a 3D action brawler where missions are divided into smaller areas with short cut-scenes in between to further the story. The Autobots link light and heavy attack in different patterns to form combos. When a blue flash appears during a combo it can be finished off with an attack in vehicle form. Robots can freely switch between robot and vehicle form. The latter is used to move around quickly and there are also longer driving sequences, often when chasing or escaping. While driving, ranged weapons can be fired and there is a rush attack and often obstacles to dodge and booster portals to receive extra speed. Melee weapons include swords, gauntlets and hammers and ranged weapons are blasters, grenade launchers etc.

While fighting in robot form, four weapon slots are available per character. A large amount of melee and ranged weapons can be collected during missions and they can be switched on the fly. Ranged weapons have an energy meter and when empty require some time to recharge. Another meter is filled up by attacking and when full a devastating attack can be triggered, unique for each Autobot. Levels often have hidden items and collectibles. There are transpatial converters that temporary reveal a hidden container in another location. A stomp attack launched from the air is sometimes used to reveal items hidden below the surface. The Autobots can also pick up and throw objects and this technique is sometimes used to solve small environment puzzles. By timing correctly incoming attacks can be dodged, which slows down time, similar to Witch Time in Bayonetta, providing an opportunity to counter. Additional attacks can be purchased later on, such as a parry move where an incoming attack can be countered right away. The game has many encounters with large robot bosses where weak points need to be exploited. After each fight a ranking is shown based on the performance.

During gameplay green and blue energon cubes can be picked up to restore health and weapon energy respectively. New missions are always started at the Ark headquarters. The player gets to select the Autobot and can define the loadout from the large inventory of weapons. Weapons have their own levels and can be made stronger through synthesis, merging weapons with a base one and the secondary ones used for parts. The credits currency earned during missions can be given to Wheeljack. He develops T.E.C.H. that provides enhanced abilities. Players need to complete a quick timing mini-game to develop them and when finished they can be selected from a large pool for two slots. Equipped T.E.C.H. can be different for each mission.</desc>

The single-player campaign gives gamers a glimpse of the action from both perspectives of the ongoing war, with players taking control of Bumblebee, Optimis Prime, or other Autobots in one mission, then commanding Starscream or Megatron in another. A new transforming system lets gamers switch from robot mode, to vehicle mode, to weapon mode on the fly, and each robot comes equipped with a special ability and several upgradeable weapons and skills. Multiplayer fans can head online to team up with or take on friends in "Deathmatch" and "Team Deathmatch" modes, attempt to take out the opposing faction's leader in "One Shall Stand" mode, strategically capture sections of the map in "Control Points" mode, and collect pieces of the Allspark in "Battle for the Shards"</desc>

Being more of a remake, than a real successor, the game once again gives the player full control over a banana republic in the Caribbean. To successfully live through his term in office, El Presidente needs to build a booming economy and keep his inhabitants happy as well as the USA and USSR.

Most of the city is built by the player himself including apartment buildings and streets. While some buildings need space to do their job (like farms), others need a road-connection or don't function without electricity. The only buildings that pop up automatically are homes of poor people. To build up his city, the player of course needs money. Money is earned several different ways. Every year the player gets foreign aid from the superpowers. Several times a year a tanker comes by and transports away export goods like oil (the new resource in Tropico 3) or bananas, also bringing money in. Another way to earn money is to make the island tourist friendly and rip them off while they are visiting. The least of the players income comes from his own people who pay lease, use the available entertainment program and such. How much everything costs is determined by the player. He is also responsible for employing from overseas, if the required expertise isn't yet available on his island which on the other hand enrages the Nationalists on the island. The Nationalists are one of the many groups of people the player needs to make happy besides each individual themselves.

In addition each citizen is his or her own entity, with their own names, relationships to other citizens, wants and desires. Some feel the need to excel in studies, others seek religious enlightenment, some just want to have a good time. They even take political affiliations and work towards those ends. The citizens do not blindly follow orders, they must be persuaded through meeting their desires, or just pure greed or terror meaning bribing them or putting out a contract on them. The latter is especially useful to keep the rebels at bay but if all fails and the rebels attack, the player's army as well as himself engage in an automatic battle until only one side stands. The game ends if the palace is blown up, the player doesn't get re-elected or the USA/USSR decide that El Presidente has become a pain in the butt. In addition the missions in the campaign feature objectives like have 150 tourists visit the island.

Besides the new 3D-engine, the biggest change in comparison to Tropico is the inclusion of a 3D-Avatar of the player inside the game. Generated at the beginning from scratch or by using one of the pre-existing characters like Fidel Castro, the avatar can be sent around the island, visiting production facilities or construction sites to temporarily increase the production and building speed. The avatar can also be send to the palace where he holds a speech and increases the freedom of the listing inhabitants.

The game features an editor that doesn't allow the player to create a new island, those are pre-defined or random generated, but instead allows him to build a new challenge with its own goals, events and difficulty-settings. These challenges can then be uploaded onto the Tropico 3-server and everyone can try and beat the current highscore on that map. No other multiplayer-mode is available.</desc>

		<desc>Turok is a first-person shooter developed by Propaganda Games, and published by Touchstone Games and Disney Interactive Studios, originally for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in February 2008. It was later ported on to Microsoft Windows in April 2008. A sequel was planned and developed for the Xbox 360 but it was cancelled before it was even officially announced.

The game is loosely based on the comic book series of the same title and is unrelated to the story and setting of previous Turok video games. Players assume the role of Native American space marine Joseph Turok, who is part of a team sent to a remote planet to apprehend his previous commanding officer, General Roland Kane, now a wanted war criminal. After crash landing, Turok discovers this planet is home to all manner of dinosaurs, and must fight both the predatory creatures and Kane's private army on his mission to take down his former mentor.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Two Worlds 2 [NTSCU].iso</path>
		<name>Two Worlds</name>
		<desc>The game takes place in a real-time three-dimensional fantasy landscape. As such it has drawn comparison with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

Much like in Oblivion and Gothic 3, the gameplay is non-linear. The player is free to explore the game world, accepting side quests at will. There is however, a core quest, centering around rescuing the protagonist's sister, who is being held for ransom by mysterious forces who are scheming to open the tomb of Aziraal, the god of fire.

The game does not utilize fixed character classes like other role-playing games. As the character gains experience and levels, it is possible to invest gained Attribute Points into any attribute, leading to a variety of game play styles and approaches.

The world in which the game takes place is called Antaloor. While traveling through the game the player will encounter new teleports, caves, villages, and other locations, and these travels are recorded by the in-game mini-map. Teleports allow rapid travel between explored regions. Horses are available for the player to ride as well as other animals/creatures, though a number of commentators have lamented the clumsy controls when mounted.

Death in the game leads to resurrection at a nearby shrine; these shrines are distributed across the game world, and also replenish health when the player comes in sufficient proximity.
There are various creatures in Two Worlds. Unlike other CRPGs with wilderness areas, enemies will not respawn, although most areas are densely populated.

Beyond the main quest there is no set storyline to follow, the player is free to choose to complete the quests of his/her liking, and explore at will. The player may choose to act as a righteous hero and be honored amongst the population, or devilishly evil and feared, through reputation gained by completing certain quests. However, the path chosen will have consequences on the outcome of the game.</desc>

		<name>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds</name>
		<desc>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds is a crossover fighting game developed by Capcom in collaboration with Eighting. The game features characters from both Capcom's video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in February 2011. It is the fifth installment of the Marvel vs. Capcom franchise and the first to use three-dimensional character models instead of sprites.

In Marvel vs. Capcom 3, players select a team of three characters to engage in combat and attempt to knock out their opponents. It features similar tag team game mechanics to earlier games in the series, along with new methods of play designed to make the game more accessible to new players. The game was produced by Ryota Niitsuma, who had previously worked on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, which utilizes the same simplified three-button attack system.

The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and character roster, while criticizing its online component and lack of features and game modes. More than 2 million units were shipped worldwide a month after its debut, rendering it a commercial success. Less than a year after its release, Capcom announced an updated version of the game, titled Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The standalone update was released in November 2011, and featured additional characters, stages, and gameplay tweaks.</desc>

		<desc>Unreal Tournament 3 (UT3) is a first-person shooter and online multiplayer video game by Epic Games, and is the latest installment of the Unreal series. It is published by Midway Games, and was released for Microsoft Windows on November 19, 2007, PlayStation 3 on December 11, 2007, and Xbox 360 on July 3, 2008. The Linux and Mac OS X versions of the game were planned to be released as downloadable installers that work with the retail disc. Ryan C. Gordon has uploaded screenshots of the game, dating from September 2008, running on both platforms.[1][2] On May 22, 2009, Ryan stated that the UT3 port for Linux was still in process.[3] On December 16, 2010, Steve Polge announced that the Linux port would never be released, making it the first Unreal Tournament game not to be released on Linux.[4]

Unreal Tournament 3 is the fourth game in the Unreal Tournament series and the eighth Unreal game, but is numbered in terms of the engine it runs on. The original Unreal Tournament uses the first Unreal Engine, while UT2003 and UT2004 use Unreal Engine 2. Since 2004 incorporates all of the content from 2003, they are regarded as part of the same generation. UT3 is the third generation, as it runs on Unreal Engine 3, and does not reuse any content.[5] In March 2008, Midway announced that UT3 had sold over a million copies worldwide.[6]

On May 8, 2014, Epic Games announced a new, free and crowdsourced Unreal Tournament title.[7][8]</desc>

		<name>Vancouver 2010</name>
		<desc>Vancouver 2010 is the officially licensed game based on the Winter Olympics 2010. It offers 14 disciplines: Alpine Skiing (four variants), bobsled, freestyle-skiing (two variants), luge, speed skating (two variants), skeleton, ski jumping and snowboard (two variants). These disciplines can be played only individually (training or championship); there is no linking element. The player has also no ways to individualize his athlete besides choosing between one of about 20 nationalities; his look and gender is set for the disciplines, e.g. the luge is only for men. 

The controls depend on rhythmical movements with the input device, e.g. during the bobsled championship the player has to mimic the movements of the both men. Besides these disciplines there are also 30 challenges where the player has to solve certain tasks, e.g. keeping a certain speed or skiing around snowmen.

The license only apples to the game's name: there are no real athletes or voice commentary. There is one course per discipline.</desc>

		<name>Watch Dogs</name>
		<desc>The storyline of Watch Dogs game is built around the concept of information warfare, data being interconnected, and the world's increasing use of technology—questioning who exactly runs the computers they depend on. The game is set in an alternate reality version of Chicago, Illinois, which is one of many cities to feature a supercomputer known as a "CtOS" (Central Operating System). The system controls almost every piece of technology in the city, and contains information on all of the city's residents and activities which can be used for various purposes. In the game's universe, the Northeast blackout of 2003 was found to be caused by a hacker, prompting the development of CtOS. The game will follow a man named Aiden Pearce, a highly skilled hacker described as a person who uses both "fists and wits." The gameplay demo shown at E3 2012 depicted Aiden's attempt to assassinate a media mogul named Joseph DeMarco, who had been wrongly acquitted on charges of murder. In a demonstration shown at E3 2013, Pearce helps a fellow hacker named T-Bone escape after he is discovered attempting to steal a motherboard.</desc>

		<desc>Gameplay[edit]
The game is set in an open world environment modeled after Barcelona, full of destructible objects, alleyways, shortcuts through office blocks and a total of 31 story missions and 105 side missions. While most missions are driving-oriented, there are also foot missions which are played from a third person perspective. A wide variety of weapons are available to the player, such as pistols and RPGs.

Among the vehicles used by Milo Burik in the game is the Pontiac G8,[2] shown in released trailers for Wheelman. Reports[3] also indicated that the Opel Astra is a drivable vehicle. In the demo, his license plate says MRTL KM8T which is a reference to Mortal Kombat, Midway's popular fighting game.</desc>

		<desc>WWE '13 is an upcoming professional wrestling video game being developed by Yuke's and published by THQ for the PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360.[1] It will be the second game in the WWE series and the fifteenth overall in the combined series. It is the sequel to WWE '12, and will be released on October 30, 2012 in North America and November 2, 2012 in United Kingdom.[2]

The game focuses on the Attitude Era of the WWF, replacing its Road to WrestleMania Mode with an Attitude Era Mode where the player plays through the Attitude Era. The game gives such characters as Stone Cold Steve Austin and elements as the Monday Night Wars a more important role in the game than in any previous WWE game.[3]</desc>

		<desc>Bond is hit by a sniper and recalls previous missions in flashbacks. All the chapters are therefore independent, set in the present day and featuring Craig as the protagonist. The game's basic premise is similar to that of other shooters of the time: linear levels with lots of enemies to kill and a cover system. The game also features a basic stealth system that is not compulsory for most missions. There are also rail-shooting missions, driving and hand-to-hand combat with bosses. Players can choose between automatic healing and the classic mechanic of collecting items to replenish health and armour.</desc>

		<path>./Games/ACDC Live Rock Band Track Pack [NTSCU].iso</path>
		<name>AC/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack</name>
		<desc>Rock Band Track Packs (called Song Packs in Europe and Australia) are a series of supplemental media discs for the Rock Band series of music video games. The packs are developed by Harmonix and Demiurge Studios (earlier packs were developed with Pi Studios), and distributed by MTV Games and Electronic Arts. Harmonix has announced they will release additional discs, containing new songs not in past releases, and have not previously been made available through downloadable content. The track packs are fully functional stand alone games and do not require separate Rock Band titles to play; however, on consoles that support downloadable content, the songs from these packs can be integrated with other Rock Band titles.


AC/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack (AC/DC Live: Rock Band) was announced on September 29, 2008, and was released for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 2. The Wii version was released on November 16, 2008. The pack contains all 18 tracks from AC/DC's Live at Donington DVD. The game, through pre-existing licensing deals that AC/DC has with the retail chains, was only available at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club. This exclusivity agreement was only applicable in the United States, and ended on November 4, 2009 when GameStop began selling new copies of the game for $20. Each copy of the track pack includes a code that can be redeemed online to allow Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 owners to download the content to their console for use in other Rock Band titles. The game can also be played as a standalone title, including a number of Achievements for Xbox 360 owners, but otherwise does not feature many of the gameplay elements of the full Rock Band titles, such as character creation or customization, online play, or a World Tour mode. The track pack retails for $30 for the PS2 version and $40 for other consoles. Harmonix has confirmed that the songs will remain exclusive to the disc release, citing AC/DC's preference to sell their music as full albums instead of singles. They have not ruled out releasing the content in the future should the band's views change.

		<path>./Games/Backbreaker [PAL][NTSCU].iso</path>
		<name>Backbreaker</name>
		<desc>Backbreaker is an American football video game, developed by British technology developer NaturalMotion, and released on 1 June 2010 in North America and on 25 June 2010 in Europe. One of its highlights is the use of Euphoria, a game animation engine that determines animations dynamically rather than depending on canned animations. Backbreaker does not use teams from the National Football League (NFL) because Electronic Arts has an exclusive license to produce NFL games in its Madden series. The game relies on an extensive logo editor and team builder that was called "one of its silver linings". NaturalMotion announced Backbreaker in August 2007, with a targeted release date of late 2008. The game ended up being delayed until mid-2010.

Backbreaker received mixed reviews. While it was praised for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it was also criticized for its weak online play, poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. After the reviews, the passing game was adjusted by the greathouse patch. The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator Metacritic, while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%. The iOS and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade. A patch released on 6 August 2010, alleviated many of the issues critics had with the game upon release and included upgrades such as: improved AI, new play books and an enhanced replay feature.[1]</desc>

		<name>Bakugan: Battle Brawlers</name>
		<desc>One day the player's character meets Dan Kuso, one of the Battle Brawlers, who teaches him the rules in a fight against Shuji. (you get a Serpenoid, a Juggernoid, and a Saurus that match the attribute you chose at the start of the game). After going to the local store and meeting Alice, who suggests the player should battle with other brawlers in the park to earn BP (Bakugan Points, the game's currency) a strange Bakugan called Leonidas falls from the sky, who is now the new best friend of the player. (Leonidas' attribute depends on what attribute you chose). Leonidas is an unknown and aggressive Bakugan that was created by all the hate and anger of the lost Bakugan trapped in the Doom Dimension. In several fights the player will meet a lot of people but at the same time a Darkus user, whose name is Marduk, decides to rule over all Bakugan together with Vladitor, another Bakugan that suddenly appears.

Right after Naga got the Silent Core, the seals that held Vladitor captive in the Doom Dimension suddenly broke and he escaped from the Doom Dimension. At the end of a tournament when Dan makes the player an official Bakugan Battle Brawler, Marduk is revealed to have allied with Hal G, Masquerade and Naga in order to defeat the Battle Brawlers and rule over the worlds and the Bakugan. The player must win the Ultimate Battle Tournament, defeating also Dan, Runo, Marucho, Julie, Shun, Masquerade, and a 1-on-1 showdown with Omega Leonidas and Battle Axe Vladitor. After the player wins, both Vladitor and Leonidas disappear, saying they have only little power left after the brawl. Later, the player discovers that Vladitor gave Leonidas his remaining power, saying he deserved it, leaving Leonidas to assume that Vladitor "wasn't all bad". The game ends with the player throwing Leonidas in the air shouting, "Bakugan brawl!".</desc>

		<name>Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts</name>
		<desc>Famed game developer Rare is reviving one of its most beloved and successful franchises exclusively on Xbox 360 with the third installment of the Banjo-Kazooie series. Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts embraces new and old fans alike, as the famous bear and bird duo return in stunning high definition for a unique adventure of epic proportions. The Lord of the Games (aka LOG) is tired of the petty squabbling between Banjo and the evil witch Gruntilda (aka Grunty) over the years, and has arranged a showdown to decide the rightful owner of Spiral Mountain. Claiming to have created every video game ever made, LOG has built the game worlds in which the contest's challenges take place. Banjo must complete LOG's challenges to win, while Grunty tries to stop him using every method her devious mind can muster. 

Throughout their adventure, players create their own abilities by building vehicles for Banjo to pilot over land, water, and air. Vehicle parts, which range from simple devices such as engines and wheels to more unusual equipment such as springs and egg guns, are earned and collected throughout the game. Players use their imagination to combine parts in any order to create whatever vehicle they choose. LOG's challenges have one goal, but players' choice of vehicle and tactics will determine how they get there. By exploring worlds and solving puzzles, players both young and old will be rewarded with more advanced and diverse vehicle parts in their quest to defeat Grunty once and for all.</desc>

		<desc>Set in WWII, Battlestations: Pacific delivers intense, action-packed combat and strategic warfare on an extraordinary scale and features two distinctly different single player campaigns.

As the Japanese however, players take control of the Imperial Japanese fleet and have the unique chance to fight at Pearl Harbor before attempting to change the course of history and take full control of the Pacific Ocean.</desc>

The titular character is a witch who shapeshifts and uses various firearms, along with magical attacks she performs with her own hair, to dispatch her foes. She awakens after a 500-year sleep and finds herself in an unfamiliar area with no memories of who or what she is. Over time, she begins to remember what caused her current predicament. 500 years before the incident that caused Bayonetta's memory loss, there were two factions preserving the balance between darkness and light in the world: the Umbra Witches, who are followers of darkness, and their counterparts, the Lumen Sages, who are followers of light.</desc>

		<desc>Game modes include practice, regular competition (where the player can select or deselect each event, for men and women), random events, Decathlon or Heptathlon and of course, the Olympics. While in previous games the Olympics were usually just a set of events, in Beijing 2008 they are much more complex, and feature a game where the player must complete a number of challenges each day with the difficulty level and number of necessary successes increasing progressively. While in the other modes there is a slight slowdown during the technical parts of the events, in Olympic the player must assign points to it, and trigger when required. The player also needs to assign points to other key areas, such as speed, technique or accuracy. Failing to reach the goal for the day forces the player to load the game and try again.</desc>

		<desc>Bionic Commando is an action-adventure game, in which the player controls player-character Nathan Spencer. The game uses several mechanics (primarily radiation) which act as barriers. These barriers are used to keep the players within the confines of the linear level design. Nathan Spencer is able to target enemies while hanging, climbing a building or even in mid-swing, while using an implement called the Bionic Arm which can also be used to attack enemies at close range. The bionic arm can be used to grab and launch objects such as boulders and cars at enemies. In addition, he is equipped with boots that enable him to kick said objects at enemies. These boots are also the reason Spencer does not take damage from extremely long falls.</desc>

Gameplay centers around firefights against the alien "robots" called Vahki, Visorak and Borhok. Players will collect Lego pieces for every enemy you defeat, and eventually enable an invulnerable Hero Mode to help defeat the Toa's enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War is a historical real-time tactics video game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. It was published by Koei and developed by Omega Force. The game is loosely based on the Hundred Years' War between the Kingdoms of England and France in the 14th and 15th centuries. Just like the Kessen and Musou series from Koei, certain liberties are taken from the original history. For example, unlike what happened in real life, it is possible to save Joan of Arc from being burned at the stake. A expansion remake, entitled Bladestorm: Nightmare was released for consoles in Japan at the end of January, 2015 and in western regions a couple months later. The worldwide Microsoft Windows release was on May 29, 2015.[</desc>

		<desc>Players will face raw danger as they encounter the fiercest animals on earth, including lions, grizzly bears, jaguars and more. Accurately modeled Cabela's equipment in the game means the firearms, tactics and gear are all realistic and precise - but this won't always help in the face of an unpredictable, open environment packed with avalanches, elephant stampedes, and piranha infested waters. If you do miss a shot and fail to stop a charging man-eating animal, you will be forced to fight it via a melee defense - but pay attention; it's likely another nearby animal will join the attack. Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2009 will also feature a wide variety of gameplay modes, including fan favorite Action Zone, and hunting scenarios ranging from surprise animal attacks to strategic hunts.</desc>

The demo includes two different pre-made card decks and supports both single player gameplay and local multiplayer for up to four players.[1] Initially released in Japan in 2006, the full game wasn't released in North America until more than a year later, in February 2008, but has never been released in Europe or Australia.</desc>

Team up with your friends to replay all the missions in co-op mode with up to four players, or explore new and exclusive multiplayer modes like "Scratch One Flattop" which pits two teams against each other in a mix of fighters and bombers to see who can sink the other team's aircraft carrier first.</desc>

		<name>Damnation</name>
		<desc>Damnation is a third-person shooter set in a steampunk-universe with the player taking over the control of Rourke, fighting through hordes and hordes of enemies as well as jumping from roof to roof and other climbing exercises in order to accomplish his objectives like freeing a prisoner or shutting down a factory. On his side the Indian healer Yakecan and the cowboy Ramon Sepherius Zagato. Of course the enemies don't just drop dead by the sight of Rourke and his friends. Instead everyone can carry around three weapons. Two big ones like a shotgun, grenade launcher or sniper rifle and one pistol which also includes gear like the railroad-spike-gun. In addition the players have access to trip-mines that can either be thrown or planted but always have to be triggered manually. Since the levels are huge and traveling on foot sometimes is either not feasible or possible, steampunk bikes stand ready for the players to be used in two different designs. The small version carries two persons with one being the driver and the second one standing on the back shooting everything in sight. The second version allows for two gunners on the back.</desc>

		<desc>Set in the crumbling infrastructure of a fictional Eastern Bloc country in the near future, the game features both single and multiplayer action, with players working their way through a world where biological weapons are a hellish nightmare, let loose on an unsuspecting populace.

The game's main character is a man named Hayden Tenno (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum), a morally ambivalent clean-up man employed by the CIA. He has congenital analgesia which renders him unable to feel pain. On a mission in a fictional former Eastern Bloc nation, he is exposed to a biological compound which mutates him, dramatically changing his right arm, and giving him the ability to grow a three-bladed throwable weapon called a glaive at will. The glaive is a part of his body, can be used to generate light, and can be controlled remotely by the player.</desc>

		<name>Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate</name>
		<desc>Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate (abbreviated to DOA5 Ultimate or just DOA5U) is a fighting game in the Dead or Alive series, developed by Team Ninja in partnership with Sega AM2, and released by Koei Tecmo for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2013. It was followed by an arcade edition later in 2013. It marks the first game in the series to use the "Ultimate" name since Dead or Alive Ultimate in 2004, as well as the first arcade game to be released by Tecmo Koei since Dead or Alive 2 Millenium in 2000.

DOA5 Ultimate is an expanded edition of 2012's Dead or Alive 5, incorporating some features from the PlayStation Vita's Dead or Alive 5 Plus as well as additional content, including five characters that are new or returning to the series (including two Ninja Gaiden characters), as well as gameplay system tweaks and expansions, many of them in the online multiplayer tag team mode (including an introduction of two-on-two tag team battles). The game received generally favorable reviews.

A free-to-play cut version of DOA5 Ultimate, titled Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate: Core Fighters, was released on the PlayStation Store alongside the retail game. The arcade edition Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate: Arcade was released on 24 December 2013, distributed by Sega. Ultimate was followed by Dead or Alive 5 Last Round in 2015.</desc>

		<desc>Infusing hip-hop music, culture and lifestyle into the gameplay, EA Chicago and Def Jam Interactive push the boundaries of game development bringing unique and innovative content to the next generation of gaming. Music is the cornerstone of hip-hop culture so EA wanted to incorporate music and rhythm into the actual gameplay mechanics. EA Chicago delivers star-stunning action and bone breaking beats as players live out the life of a hip hop mogul, going from rags to riches. Incorporating hip-hop culture into every aspect of the game, DEF JAM: ICON delivers the intensity of a no-holds-barred street fight but with style and rhythm. Music affects how players fight in each venue and environmental interactions and hazards become a key strategy to staying alive. The game's unique fighting gameplay controls introduce a new way for gamers to fight as they assume the role of top celebrity characters such as Ludacris, T.I. and Big Boi. Innovative controls give better feedback to players so they feel like they're actually throwing the combat moves. Gamers can now fight with the style and flash of the superstar personalities.</desc>

		<desc>The game takes place in Sanctuary, the dark fantasy world of the Diablo series. This world was saved twenty years prior by a handful of unnamed heroes in Diablo II, having survived the onslaught brought by the armies of the Burning Hells, who have gone mad from their ordeals. It is up to a new generation of heroes to face the forces of evil threatening the world of Sanctuary.

Players will have the opportunity to explore familiar settings such as Tristram.

The only confirmed NPCs are Deckard Cain, who has appeared in both of the previous games, and his niece, Leah, a new character who accompanies the hero in quests from time to time. The plot will revolve around two surviving Lesser Evils, Azmodan and Belial, and an artifact known as the Black Soulstone. Diablo's world map is composed primarily of two main continents with several small islands in the Northwest region. The world of Sanctuary has been dramatically changed by the destruction of the World Stone in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Ball: Raging Blast</name>
		<desc>Dragon Ball: Raging Blast (ドラゴンボール レイジングブラスト Doragon Bōru Reijingu Burasuto?) is a video game based on the manga and anime franchise Dragon Ball. It was developed by Spike and published by Namco Bandai for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 game consoles throughout North America, while everywhere else it would be published under the Bandai label. It was released in Japan, North America, Europe, and Australia during the second week of November 2009. In Europe, a limited edition pack of the game was also released that included bonus collector material.
The game is a cel-shaded 3D fighter that allows players to play as characters within the Dragon Ball universe, either against the game's AI or another player in one of the various modes of play both on and offline. The game is one of the first games in the Dragon Ball franchise to be published by Namco Bandai in North America, as the company would acquire the gaming license from previous license holder Atari in July of that same year.
The game was met with mixed to negative reviews from gaming critics for its storymode and overall gameplay controls.</desc>

Quake Wars features similar gameplay to Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, but with the addition of controllable vehicles and aircraft as well as multiple AI deployables,[13] asymmetric teams, much larger maps and the option of computer-controlled bot opponents. Unlike the previous Enemy Territory games, Quake Wars is a commercial release rather than a free download.

Enemy Territory: Quake Wars received mostly positive reviews upon release, although it received some criticism on consoles.</desc>

The game begins with Chopin lying on his deathbed and having a strange dream in which he is transferred into a fantasy world where places and people have musically sounding names. Chopin encounters a girl named Polka, a magician who is on the run from her own destiny (since all magicians die young in her world). Other people join them on a quest to overthrow an evil nobleman. Events from Chopin's real life are shown as parallels to what happens in his dream.</desc>

		<name>F.E.A.R. 3</name>
		<desc>The supernatural shooting series known as F.E.A.R., short for First Encounter Assault Recon, makes its third entry on consoles with a single-player campaign and two-player cooperative action. In both modes, you will control the genetically enhanced soldier from the original game, Point Man, who has the power to alter time. Also available in the co-op mode is Point Man's scheming brother, Paxton Fettel, who uses the power of telekinesis to resume "life" as an undead spirit.

The story once again centers around Point Man and Paxton's mother, Alma Wade, whose psychic powers have created an alternate dimension filled with ghastly creatures and other horrors. To combat the paranormal, players can enter slow-motion combat, utilize 360-degree cover, and more. F.E.A.R. 3 also features a mechanic called the "generative scare system," which introduces random events designed to keep players on edge. Developer Day 1 Studios consulted with famed director John Carpenter for the in-game cinematics and horror writer Steve Niles to assist with the script.</desc>

		<name>Fuzion Frenzy 2</name>
		<desc>Until four years ago, Fuzion Frenzy was the most popular tournament on Earth and was broadcast live to all corners of the world. However, due to the extreme competitiveness of the players, the leaders of Earth banned it, fearing its influence on the general population.

Recently, however, the world's leaders have struggled with the problem of overpopulation, and have come up with a plan for the citizens of Earth to immigrate to space. To encourage immigration, the leaders have brought back the Fuzion Frenzy tournament, but with a change they have set up game zones on various other planets. The people of Earth welcome this news, especially the announcement that the leaders have reinstated the six most famous players, who are returning with renewed enthusiasm.

Fuzion Frenzy 2 combines over 40 mini games with futuristic arcade action, custom tournaments, Xbox Live features and more to create the ultimate party game exclusively on Xbox 360. Play with your friends and family to find out who is the strongest among you.</desc>

		<desc>Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV.

Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.

The biggest, most dynamic and most diverse open world ever created, Grand Theft Auto V blends storytelling and gameplay in new ways as players repeatedly jump in and out of the lives of the game's three lead characters, playing all sides of the game's interwoven story.

All the classic hallmarks of the groundbreaking series return, including incredible attention to detail and Grand Theft Auto's darkly humorous take on modern culture, alongside a brand new and ambitious approach to open world multiplayer.</desc>

The anniversary edition comes with the same single player campaign, the only difference being that the player can switch between the graphics engine used in the original Combat Evolved (for identical graphics to the original), or switch to the same graphics engine used in Halo: Reach (for more modern graphics) at any point during the campaign, even mid session. The campaign also supports co operative gameplay.

The multiplayer portion of the game has all the same maps featured in the original as well as several new ones, and like the single player, players can switch between the classic and modern graphics at any point during the session. The multiplayer has also been enhanced with some of the features from the more recent Halo games including emblems, weapon loadouts, customisable armour and selectable gender.</desc>

		<name>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1</name>
		<desc>Well-read wizards and witches begin their ultimate adventure in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. In line with the contemporary film productions, the 2010 game's storyline follows the first portion of the final novel in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. From a third-person 3D perspective, players explore perilous scenes detailed in the book, and engage in action-oriented battle using powerful blasts from their magic wands. Xbox 360 gamers with the Kinect camera-control system can also cast spells simply by waving their hands in magical patterns. Two players can team up in cooperative multiplayer, taking the roles of any of the three main characters. The video game adventure is set away from the familiar school grounds for the first time, following Harry, Ron, and Hermione on a run for their lives from the forces of Voldemort, who has come to control the governing Ministry of Magic, as well as the once-safe Hogwarts academy.

Guiding the three young heroes, players travel to remote and dangerous locations in a desperate quest to destroy the Horcruxes, objects of great power that are the secret to Voldemort's immortality. Different objectives and battles are best won by using the various special abilities of each character, calling on them to work together to overcome each series of challenges. No longer mere students, sheltered from the dangers of the world of magic by Professor Dumbledore and their other wise and kind teachers, Harry and his friends must face ferocious monsters, grim Death Eaters, and powerful rival wizards who have allied with the Dark One. The game also features magical battles against monsters and villains from earlier Harry Potter books, offering players a chance to further hone their wand-wielding skills. The dangers of the Deathly Hallows are greater than any he has faced before, but surviving this first part of the final adventure is the only way to prepare "The Boy Who Lived" to meet his destiny, in an inevitable showdown against Voldemort when the story comes to its conclusion.</desc>

Story
Left 4 Dead 2 is set at roughly the same time as the original – just after the outbreak that turned most of the population into various zombie mutants. Players assume the role of four new "Survivors," each with their own personality and new dialog. The game leads these "Survivors" through the southeastern region of the US - from Savannah, Georgia through the bayou country, and climaxing in New Orleans’ French Quarter.

Gameplay
Just as with the original Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2 is a first-person shooter which pits players against hordes of zombie-like enemies. As you would expect in a scenario where you are regularly surrounded by masses of the undead, it is very good thing to have plenty of help, as well as weapons at your disposal, and Left 4 Dead 2 has players covered on both accounts. The game features several multiplayer options including 2-8 player online and offline (via system link) support in several modes seen in the first game, including Campaign, Versus, and Survival, as well as the new Scavenge Mode. This new multiplayer option tasks players, in the role of survivors to find a limited number of fuel canisters hidden in a level in order to keep their individual generators going, while other players in the role of the infected try to stop them. In addition the game features very strong co-op play support, with 2-player support locally and 2-4 player support online.

The game features a wealth of melee weapons and additional items handy for battling enemies up-close and personal. Along with melee weapons seen in the first game, players can look forward to wielding new weapons like axes, chainsaws, frying pans, etc. Firearms are also available, but seeing as zombie fighting usually requires a little elbow grease, melee weapons are the mainstay. In addition, players can carry other useful items, including a variety of throwing weapons and several different kinds of support items, like flashlights to startle enemies and light the way in dark environments and healing items like first aid kit and defibrillator kits.

Customize with AI Director 2.0
Introducing the AI Director 2.0, Left 4 Dead 2's dynamic gameplay is taken to the next level by giving the Director the ability to procedurally change weather effects, world objects, and pathways in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match the players' performance. The result is a unique game session custom fitted to provide a satisfying and uniquely challenging experience each time the game is played.

Key Features

Quality Co-op Gameplay - Left 4 Dead 2 features quality next generation co-op action gaming from the makers of Half-life, Portal, Team Fortress and Counter-Strike.
AI Director 2.0 - Advanced technology dubbed "The AI Director" drives Left 4 Dead’s unique gameplay – customizing enemy population, effects, and music, based upon the players’ performance. Left 4 Dead 2 features "AI Director 2.0," which expands the Director’s ability to customize level layout, world objects, weather, and lighting to reflect different times of day.
New Melee Weapons – Put a whole slew of melee weapons including axes, chainsaws, frying pans and baseball bats to use which allow you to get up close with the zombies.
Meet "The Survivors" - The game features four different survivors, a new storyline and new dialog.
More Game - On day one, Left 4 Dead 2 features more co-operative campaigns, more campaigns and maps for the versus game modes than the original Left 4 Dead did, plus support for Survival Mode right out of the box.
Xbox LIVE Co-op Support - Along with the usual achievement points, Xbox LIVE stats, rankings, and other support drives collaborative play.

		<name>Legendary</name>
		<desc>From the same Spark Unlimited development team that brought gamers the alternate history FPS Turning Point: Fall of Liberty, comes Legendary, a game that once again begins with New York City coming under attack. However, instead of a technically superior Nazi army swarming into Gotham, mythological creatures have been unleashed onto the landscape by small time art thief Charles Deckard, who decided to take a peek inside his latest target: Pandora's box. The resulting pandemonium finds players controlling Deckard through the midst of a three-sided conflict between rival secret societies and beasts such as werewolves, minotaurs, gryphons, and golems. The Council of 98 and the Black Order both seek the power of Pandora's box for different reasons, while the monsters attack everyone and wreak havoc on the destructible environments.

Having been marked with The Signet, denoting that only he can re-seal Pandora's box, Deckard must travel from New York to London, and on to Durham, England, to restore peace to the world. The Signet allows him to draw health from fallen creatures and perform an attack that repels all nearby foes, but he must rely on grabbing ammunition from dead soldiers, and his weapons are standard pistols, shotguns, and rifles. Multiplayer modes include a standard four-on-four deathmatch, with players controlling the Black Order or the Council of 98 while the creatures lurk hungrily in the background, and a hunting mode that lets gamers try to kill as many creatures as possible within a given time limit.</desc>

		<desc>Madden NFL 25 is an American football sports video game based on the National Football League and published by EA Sports. It was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in late August 2013. Instead of numbering it Madden NFL 14 with the year like in previous versions of the Madden NFL games, the "25" in the title refers the 25th anniversary of the series.[1] The eighth generation console versions of Madden NFL 25 are the very first games to run on EA Sports's Ignite game engine. However, the seventh generation versions still run on EA's previous game engine. The standard versions feature former Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders, on the cover. The eight-generation versions feature Minnesota Vikings running back, Adrian Peterson, on the cover. The eighth-generation versions were released as launch titles for the PlayStation 4 on November 15, 2013, and Xbox One on November 22, 2013.</desc>

		<desc>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds (Japanese: マーヴル VS. カプコン 3 フェイト オブ トゥー ワールド Hepburn: Māvuru bāsasu Kapukon Surī: Feito obu Tū Wārudo?) is a crossover fighting game developed by Capcom in collaboration with Eighting. The game features characters from both Capcom's video game franchises and comic book series published by Marvel Comics. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in February 2011. It is the fifth installment of the Marvel vs. Capcom franchise and the first to use three-dimensional character models instead of sprites.

In Marvel vs. Capcom 3, players select a team of three characters to engage in combat and attempt to knock out their opponents. It features similar tag team game mechanics to earlier games in the series, along with new methods of play designed to make the game more accessible to new players. The game was produced by Ryota Niitsuma, who had previously worked on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, which utilizes the same simplified three-button attack system.

The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and character roster, while criticizing its online component and lack of features and game modes. More than 2 million units were shipped worldwide a month after its debut, rendering it a commercial success. Less than a year after its release, Capcom announced an updated version of the game, titled Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The standalone update was released in November 2011, and featured additional characters, stages, and gameplay tweaks.</desc>

No longer a cop, Max is close to washed-up, drunk and addicted to painkillers. Without a job on the force, Max has left the greater New York area, and finds himself in Sao Paulo, Brazil, working as private security. The story of Max's descent from vengeful, leather-jacket wearing detective roaming the alleys of New York to the broken, shaven-headed man out for justice on unfamiliar streets far from home is at the center of Max Payne 3. In addition to Max's classic shoot-dodge moves, there is now a combination of Natural Motion's Euphoria character behavior system and Bullet Time to enhance his moves. Partners and sidekicks will play a large role in this game to help Max in his quest for vengeance.</desc>

		<name>Mayhem 3D</name>
		<desc>Mayhem is a fast paced arcade racing and car destruction game. The inspiration for the game comes from two distinct types of events: Demolition Derby and Banger Racing. A demolition derby is more of an American pastime, primarily at state fairs and the like. Participants take an old beat down car, strip it of all the glass and other "dangerous" elements, spray paint the car and decorate it to their liking, then beat it to death at the main event. The last vehicle standing is the victor. A Banger Race is more practiced in the UK. Races take place on small courses with pits and hills, and drivers are encouraged to send their opponents off course. Courses can have hazards and obstacles, and the "figure 8" shaped course is a staple of the race. No matter whether it's Banger races or demolition derbys, the fact is that everyone love to see the everyman take it to the mat and come out a victor, and that's what Mayhem is all about.</desc>

		<desc>Mercenaries 2: World in Flames is an explosive open-world action game set in a massive, highly reactive, war-torn world. A power-hungry tyrant messes with Venezuela's oil supply, sparking an invasion that turns the country into a warzone. But for you, international crisis is all upside: You are a mercenary, and you profit from chaos. Mercenaries 2 features a slew of potential clients, all willing to pay you to do their dirty work. Dirty deeds, done for exorbitant fees. These are world powers with deep pockets, deep grudges, and enough arms and ammo to start World War III. This is your kind of environment. Mercenaries 2 features the latest and most dangerous in civilian and military tech, everything from shiny new sports cars, to the future-tech satellite-guided bunker-busting mini-nuke. Tanks, APCs, boats, luxury automobiles - you name it, you can have it delivered to you in real time. And if you run out of cash you can always 'acquire' the gear you need in the field. If you see it, you can buy it, steal it, or blow the living crap out of it. Play your own way, or play with the help of a friend in the new cooperative multiplayer mode. You are not a soldier. You don't have to play by anyone's rules. You have your own code: you will fulfill the terms of the contract, no matter what. Not everyone in the world of Mercenaries is as honorable. Everyone will try and screw you, given the chance. They think they can get away with it, because they don't know rule #1: EVERYBODY PAYS.</desc>

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The "Metal Gear Solid (MGS)" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected. The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.</desc>

		<desc>Set in the shattered subway of a post apocalyptic Moscow, Metro 2033 is a story of intensive underground survival where the fate of mankind rests in your hands. In 2013 the world was devastated by an apocalyptic event, annihilating almost all mankind and turning the earth's surface into a poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age. The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside. You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised Underground. Having never ventured beyond your Metro Station-City limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat. Your journey takes you from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, where your actions will determine the fate of mankind.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Metro Last Light [RF].iso</path>
		<name>Metro: Last Light</name>
		<desc>Metro: Last Light (also known as Metro 2033: A Light of Hope in Russia) is a single-player post-apocalyptic-themed first-person shooter video game with stealth and survival horror elements, developed by Ukrainian studio 4A Games and published by Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in May 2013.[1] PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released August 26, 2014.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, part of the universe of the novel Metro 2033 and its sequels, written by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, but does not follow any direct storylines from the books. Previously announced as Metro 2034,[2] the game is a sequel to the video game Metro 2033, and although Glukhovsky did work with developer 4A Games, it bears no relation to the book Metro 2034. Rumors on his website point to the upcoming book, Metro 2035, to be a novelization of Metro: Last Light, but it will cover the plot and dialogue in much greater detail and length.

Initially, the game was to be published under THQ and expected to be released in the middle of 2012;[3] it was announced on February 2, 2012, that the game would be delayed until the first quarter of 2013, and on March 1, 2013 the game was delayed again until May. Following THQ's closure in January 2013, the intellectual property was acquired by video game publisher Deep Silver.

Metro: Last Light received positive reviews from critics. Praise was directed at the game's story (including its atmosphere, presentation, and environments), graphics (especially on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One), and the improvements made over Metro 2033 (such as the controls, gunplay, sound, and stealth mechanics). The game did, however, draw some criticism for its linear sequences, AI, and technical issues.


ust like the original game Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light is played from the perspective of Artyom, the player-character. The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system, but occasionally missions bring the player above ground.

As a first-person shooter, Metro: Last Light features a variety of firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which the player will use in combat. Combat alternates between the player fighting mutants and the player fighting hostile humans. Mutants do not possess weapons and tend to physically attack the player in swarms, while humans fight with the same firearms available to the player. The game features recharging health rather than a traditional health points system—if the player avoids taking damage for a period, health will slowly recharge. The player can speed up this process by using a stim from a medkit, which will almost instantly heal the player to full health. When the player is severely injured, it may take over twenty seconds to return to full health. Health does not regenerate on, or above the "Hardcore" difficulty.

In the post-apocalyptic environment, ammunition is a rare and essential commodity. Pre-apocalypse military-grade ammunition is used as currency; to avoid "shooting money", the player can also use lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and items. The military-grade ammo can be used to purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations.

The game's locations reflect the dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and noises are frequent, and, for the most part, the player has to rely on their rechargeable flashlight (and sometimes, a pair of night-vision goggles) to find the way around in otherwise total darkness. Even more lethal is the surface, as it is severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times due to the toxic air.[5] Often, locations have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map, leaving the player to try to find their objectives with only a compass.

As Metro: Last Light aims to be immersive, the gameplay and interface are somewhat atypical. The game lacks a health meter, relying on audible heart rate and blood spatters on the screen to show the player's current state of health. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask, which last several minutes each and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. There is no heads-up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail—rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The gas mask can become visibly damaged and will stop functioning if punctured, requiring it to be replaced. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammo and they have to reload. The game does feature sparse traditional HUD elements, such as an ammunition indicator. However, on the hardest difficulty setting, no HUD elements are present, and players have to keep track of ammunition by the partly visible magazines.

There are also certain moral choices in the game that give Karma. Good Karma can be acquired by good actions, such as rescuing people from the enemy characters. Bad Karma can be acquired from evil actions, such as killing people randomly or stealing things.</desc>

Now the aliens populate the planet, the world is a wasteland and the few remaining human survivors are relegated to dwelling in sewers, subways and basements to plot their revenge.

An action-packed third-person shooter, MorphX drops players into the middle of the fallout in Moscow, Russia. As part of the new resistance, players awaken in an alien laboratory with the option to enhance their stamina and health with Alien DNA, but at the cost of gradually turning into a monster. In an effort to fight the aliens and find an antidote to the mutation, players can choose to either use the Alien DNA to their advantage, or reject it and focus solely on collecting a variety of weapons to take down their enemies.</desc>

		<name>Naruto: Rise of a Ninja</name>
		<desc>Naruto: Rise of a Ninja is a fighting role-playing video game for the Xbox 360, developed by Ubisoft Montreal, making it the first Naruto game to be developed by a non-Japanese company. The game is specifically based on the English dubbed version of the anime. The game was released in 2007. A sequel titled Naruto: The Broken Bond was released in the following year.

Gameplay

Naruto: Rise of a Ninja consists of two major gameplay modes: one-on-one fighting mode and a role-playing mode, where Konoha serves as a main hub to access various missions players can go on. The main story mode alternates between these two modes and takes place from the beginning of the series to the end of the Invasion of Konoha arc (episodes 1-80 of the anime), with included sidequests. It features gameplay similar to that of a 3D platformer, like jumping acrobatically from rooftop to rooftop or racing through checkpoints, as well as having one-on-one brawls much like the Naruto: Clash of Ninja series. Like with most Naruto games, it features cel-shaded graphics. The game allows online versus multiplayer via Xbox Live, titled "The Forest of Death". By defeating other opponents, players rank up and eventually gain points to complete the exam. If the player is defeated, they must begin from the bottom of the table all over again, but the points are still kept. Offline play and two-player versus mode are also available.

The game supports downloadable content; five new characters have been made available (Shikamaru, Choji, Jiraiya, the 3rd Hokage, and Temari). Downloadable content also adds two new arenas to play in and additional achievements for each character played in the Forest of Death.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is a military simulation video game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 developed by British game developer Codemasters. Codemasters has advertised the game as a tactical shooter designed to represent modern infantry combat realistically. It is a stand-alone sequel to Bohemia Interactive's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, but was developed entirely by Codemasters due to a falling-out between the two companies.</desc>

		<name>Operation Flashpoint: Red River</name>
		<desc>Operation Flashpoint: Red River enlists players to lead a hostile force in a remote land, surrounded by serene mountains and deadly serious mission objectives. Building upon Dragon Rising, the series' high-def generation debut, additions in Red River include refinements to squad and enemy AI, a more accessible inventory system, and character class roles, with player-picked upgrades as experience is earned. The game is designed for four-player co-op, and even in single-player modes, a second player can drop in and out of the battle at any time. Although modern military shooter action is the substance of Red River, the violent combat is presented through the personal experiences of the main characters, a small team of Marine Corps infantrymen. The adventure plays out in the landlocked country of Tajikistan, bordered by Afghanistan to the south and China to the east. Leading in from earlier Operation Flashpoint briefings, threats from the People's Liberation Army play a significant role as the game's narrative develops, but much of the game takes place to the north and west, along the banks of the Vakhsh, known as the "Red River" to the people who live there. With shifting international tensions, the political-thriller plot line is broken into three separate acts. The mission begins with an assignment to secure an isolated dam system, in need of repair, against terrorist activity.</desc>

		<name>Overlord</name>
		<desc>Controlling a mysterious figure that has inherited the legacy of the evil, long-dead Overlord, the player emerges, near death, from the ruins of the old Overlord's Dark Tower. Only the player's actions determine if they will rise to become the new all-powerful Overlord; it's all down to how much of a bad ass they want to be in order to succeed...evil or really evil! Played out with plenty of black humour and dark irony, the game immerses players in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters. Overlord's key innovation is the introduction of an array of impish creatures – the Minions. They believe you are the old Overlord reborn and will use their unique skills to fetch, fight and die for you. Throughout the game players actively control a horde of these gremlin-like critters and they follow your every instruction no matter how despotic or, for the Minions, life threatening it is.</desc>

Players continue the story taking the role of the young woman Chell, who defeated the artificial intelligence computer system GLaDOS in the first game. After the events of the first game, she was placed in stasis until eventually woken up again. The sequel still takes place at Aperture Science Labs, but it is now overrun by decay and nature. Much more than in the first game, Chell moves past the clean test chambers and explores the gloomy industrial setting of the laboratory.

Just like in the first game, the gameplay is based around portals. By shooting a starting portal and ending portal at suitable surfaces, certain uncrossable gaps can be bridged. Just like in the first game, there are also many test chambers where puzzles need to be solved, using cubes, turrets, platforms and special portal tricks to gain a lot of speed.</desc>

		<name>Quake 4</name>
		<desc>Quake 4 is a first-person shooter video game, the fourth title in the series of Quake series. The game was developed by Raven Software and published by Activision. Raven Software collaborated with id Software, the creators and developers of preceding Quake games. In this case, id Software supervised the development of the game as well as providing the Doom 3 engine, now referred to as "id Tech 4" and released under the GNU General Public License on 22 November 2011, upon which it was built. Quake 4 went gold in early October 2005 and was released on 18 October 2005 for Microsoft Windows and later for Linux, Xbox 360 and OS X. A special DVD Collectors Edition also exists, including promotional material and the game Quake II with its expansions, The Reckoning and Ground Zero. The Xbox 360 version of Quake 4 is based on the Special Collectors Edition, and therefore also includes Quake II. On 4 August 2011 the game was made available through Steam.

Plotwise, the game is a sequel to Quake II and takes place during the same war as Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. Compared to other titles in the Quake series, Quake 4 has an increased emphasis on the single-player portion of the game.[6] A multiplayer mode is available, but it does not involve playable bots like Quake III Arena, without 3rd party modifications.[7]</desc>

		<name>Ridge Racer 6</name>
		<desc>Ridge Racer 6 is the sixth installment in the Ridge Racer series of racing games. It was released on Xbox 360 on 22 November 2005 in North America, 10 December 2005 in Japan, and 20 January 2006 in Europe.


Like previous Ridge Racer titles, the focus of gameplay is on placing first out of 14 in numerous 3-lap races across several tracks and numerous cars. In most races, the player can earn up to three nitrous boosts by successfully drifting around corners without crashing, which can then be used to give the player a short burst of speed. Some races are labeled as "no-nitrous," which prevent the player from earning any nitrous during the race, though the player can optionally enable nitrous. If the player wins using this option, the race is considered complete, but noted for breaking the no-nitrous rule. Some races are also Duels between the player and a boss opponent, who is usually equipped with a much better car than the player can select from.

Ridge Racer 6 introduces a career-mode "World Xplorer," a branching-tree arrangement of races in which the player can only attempt races next to a race that has already been successfully completed. The layout of the races in the Xplorer is such that the position of a race will indicate what class of car can be used (horizontal position) and the difficulty of the course (vertical position). Rewards can be obtained by completing certain races or completing all races that enclose an area on the Xplorer, and usually offers new cars but also include additional variations of the tracks (mirroring and reverse) or new branches added to the tree. A player can also engage in quick races and time challenges for any track and car that has been unlocked.

There are thirty new circuits available including "Surfside Resort" and "Harborline 765." Also, there are around 130 cars (including 10 special). Online multiplayer is possible with up to 14 players racing against each other and downloadable content is available via Microsoft's Xbox Live service. Players can download another player's "ghost" replay from Xbox Live and attempt to beat it.

Like other Ridge Racer games, this iteration goes beyond cars to feature other outlandish vehicles as well, called "special machines" in the game. These include a hovercraft (Assoluto Pronzione), a tripod supercar (Himmel 490B) and an oversized SUV that can be very loud (Danver Bass Cruiser).[1] The game, as with all games in the Ridge Racer series, contains copious amount of references to other Namco games, such as Pac-Man, Soulcalibur, and Ace Combat.

The game also features a Full Motion Video opening, starring series mascot Reiko Nagase.

In Japan, Namco announced that it expected to sell 500,000 copies of Ridge Racer 6 for the Xbox 360, although far fewer copies were actually sold. Ridge Racer 7 for the PlayStation 3 is something of a "director's cut"/"final version" of Ridge Racer 6, but with major differences such as new vehicles that were not seen in Ridge Racer 6 such as Sinseong, a Korean brand.</desc>

		<name>Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure - Starter Pack</name>
		<desc>Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure is the first video game in the Skylanders series. It is a video game that is played along with toy figures that interact with it through a "Portal of Power", that reads their tag through NFC and features the voices of Josh Keaton, Dave Wittenberg, Darin De Paul, Joey Camen, Audrey Wasilewski, Keythe Farley and Kevin Michael Richardson.

Skylanders Spyro's Adventure was published by Activision and developed by Toys for Bob. It was released on October 12, 2011 in Australia for the PC and October 13, 2011 on other consoles. The game was released in Europe on October 14, 2011, in North America on October 16, 2011, and it was released in South America (including Brazil) by Neoplay on December 15, 2011.[1][2]

Japan eventually finally saw a release of this game, being handled by Toys "R" Us and Square Enix and was released for the Wii, PlayStation 3, Nintendo 3DS and the region has also received a unique Wii U port exclusively (instead of having an Xbox 360 release), being released on July 12, 2013, which was nearly two years after its release in the western regions, thus making this the first Spyro game to be released in Japan in almost 10 years, since Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy.[3] It is also the final Japanese release of Spyro the Dragon series to be owned by Vivendi SA (Formerly Vivendi Universal).

Activision announced that as of June 3, 2012, the game had been the top selling console and handheld video game worldwide for 2012.[4][5] As of March 31, 2012, Activision has sold over 30 million Skylanders toys, and sales are expected to exceed $500 million by the end of the year.[6][7] A direct sequel, Skylanders: Giants, was released in 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, Wii U, and Xbox 360.

This is the only Skylanders game to be released on PC.</desc>

		<desc>Supreme Commander (abbreviated SupCom) is a real-time strategy computer game designed by Chris Taylor and developed by his company, Gas Powered Games. The game is considered to be a spiritual successor to Taylor's 1997 game Total Annihilation,[1] alongside the Spring remake. First announced in the August 2005 edition of PC Gamer magazine,[2] the game was released on February 16, 2007 in Europe and February 20, 2007 in North America. A standalone expansion, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, was released on November 6 of the same year. A sequel, Supreme Commander 2, has also been released.

Supreme Commander is focused on using a giant bipedal mech called an Armored Command Unit (or ACU) to build a base, then upgrading units to reach higher technology tiers, and conquering opponents. The player can command one of three factions: the Aeon Illuminate, the Cybran Nation, or the United Earth Federation. Supreme Commander was highly anticipated in pre-release previews, and was well received by critics, with a Metacritic average of 86 out of 100.[3]</desc>

The people of Terca Lumireis have come to rely on "blastia", an ancient civilization's technology with a wide array of capabilities, such as providing water, powering ships, or creating barriers around major cities and towns to protect them from monsters. The Imperial Knights and Guild members also use "bodhi blastia" to enhance their abilities in combat. The blastia, created by the elf-like Krityans, are fueled by a substance called "aer" that lends its power to the blastia's ability, but can be fatal to humans in large concentrations.</desc>

		<name>The First Templar</name>
		<desc>The First Templar is a third-person action-adventure game, with a historical-fiction setting and two playable main characters. The game takes place during the late 13th century, in the pre-dawn of the Enlightenment. Its story follows two unlikely companions: a French Templar Knight and a young noblewoman who has been accused of heresy and driven from her homeland.

Single players can control either one of the characters, allowing the computer to control the other and switching between the two to access the most useful skills from one situation to the next. In the game's two-player drop-in cooperative mode, each player controls a character, working together to battle enemies and solve environmental puzzles. The characters grow more powerful with experience, as players custom-develop them up a branching skill tree.

Weaving through themes of justice, conspiracy, and the secrets of the Holy Grail, the narrative calls on players to contemplate their actions in context, as even the most righteous cause may be carried out in a gruesome and unscrupulous manner. The First Templar was developed by Bulgaria's Haemimont Games, creator of adventuresome real-time strategy games with deeply researched historical settings, including Celtic Kings, Imperium Romanum, and Tzar.</desc>

		<name>Tomb Raider</name>
		<desc>Tomb Raider is a 2013 action-adventure video game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix's European subsidiary. It is the tenth title in the Tomb Raider franchise, and operates as a reboot that reconstructs the origins of Lara Croft. Tomb Raider was first released on 5 March 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and later on 23 January 2014 for OS X, on 27 April 2016 for Linux, and on 7 March 2017 for Shield TV.

Crystal Dynamics began development of Tomb Raider soon after the release of Tomb Raider: Underworld in 2008. Rather than a sequel, the team decided to completely reboot the series, re-establishing the origins of Lara Croft for the second time, as they did with Tomb Raider: Legend. Tomb Raider is set on Yamatai, an island from which Lara, who is untested and not yet the battle-hardened explorer she is in other titles in the series, must save her friends and escape while being hunted down by a malevolent cult.

Gameplay elements focus more on survival, although exploration is used within the game when exploring the island and various optional tombs. It is also the first game in the main series to have multiplayer, the first game in the series to be published by Square Enix, after the latter's acquisition of Eidos Interactive in 2009, and the first game in the series to be given a "Mature" rating from the ESRB. Camilla Luddington was announced to voice and perform as Lara Croft in 2010, replacing Keeley Hawes.</desc>

It uses an improved version of the Legend game engine,[3] and it includes all of the original environments from Tomb Raider.[3]

The game was co-developed by Crystal Dynamics and Buzz Monkey Software for the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 2, Windows and Wii.[4] Eidos announced 1 June 2007 as the European release date for the PS2 and Windows version, with the North American release to follow on 5 June 2007.[5][6] Additionally, the subscription PC gaming service GameTap announced that the game will be available on their service on the same day as the game went to retailers.[7] The PSP version was released on 9 August 2007 in the United States and on 26 October 2007 in Europe, with the Wii version released in Europe on 7 December 2007.[8] An Xbox 360 version was released on 23 October 2007[9] and a version for the PlayStation 3 is included in The Tomb Raider Trilogy collection released in March 2011.[10] The Mac OS X version of the game was released in February 2008 by Feral Interactive.[1]

The game was well received by critics, but only sold 1.3 million copies worldwide, making it the least commercially successful game in the Tomb Raider franchise.[11]</desc>

		<desc>Packed with a whole host of new gameplay features and all new artwork designed from scratch, Tropico 5 takes the series into a new and exciting direction - dynasties! You, as El Presidente, will first take control of the infamous island of Tropico during early colonial times and then guide it through the centuries as the world changes and moves ever forward. You must tackle the changing needs of your people, as well as opposing governments and factions, and thus lay the foundations for your own dynasty. As you move through your years in office you can promote members of your extended family on the island to positions of power: such as ambassador, commanding general or even Supreme Ruler, to ensure your legacy thrives through the eras. As your influence and wealth grows, so do the threats to your burgeoning island superpower. Can you survive both World Wars, prosper through the Great Depression, rule as an iron-fisted dictator through the Cold War and advance your country to modern times and beyond? From the 19th to the 21st century, each era carries its own challenges and opportunities. As well as a wealth of other new features, including advanced trading mechanics, technology, scientific research trees and island exploration, Tropico 5 will add cooperative and competitive multiplayer for up to four players for the first time in the series' history! Viva El Presidente!</desc>

This means, of course, that vanilla Sagat, who was nerfed by later versions of the game, can go up against the rebalanced characters from Ultra. "In all the years that I've been playing through the SF4 series, I can't count how many times discussions on 'who the strongest character has been thus far' have come up among players both old and new," Capcom's Peter Rosas, himself a former tournament player, wrote on Capcom Unity. "Seeing of how there was no actual way to measure whether vanilla SF4 Sagat was stronger than AE Yun, players would engage in long theoretical discussions with no way to figure out who was right. Well, time to change that in Ultra SF!"</desc>

		<desc>Death's daughter, Scarlett, journeys into the heart of 16th century Venice to stop an evil necromancer and his undead underlings in this action/role-playing game from German developer Deck 13. Scarlett can equip axes, swords, war hammers, and other weapons to slay her enemies. Combat involves pressing a button to swing, and then timing subsequent button presses to string together powerful combos. Scarlett can also enter a spirit world at any time to move without being seen as well as communicate with the dead. The action takes place predominately within Venice, as players explore the city's five districts and underground catacombs in search of ways to reach her tyrannical target. As she defeats enemies, Scarlett will earn skill points that can be spent on various magic and melee techniques taught by skill trainers. These abilities allow Scarlett to block with specific weapon types, perform longer chain attacks, cast life-stealing spells, and more.</desc>

But one day, a certain Robert Pelham has the courage to double-cross her - a serious mistake. Mad with rage, she sets off on a quest for revenge, travelling across several continents and through hordes and hordes of minions. The game is designed like a Grindhouse movie, with scratches all over the screen, missing scenes, lots of blood and gore and a heavy emphasis on action scenes.
WET emphasises acrobatic stunts. Although Rubi can kill enemies with her arsernal by walking and shooting, she doesn't do much damage that way and is very slow. Instead, she has to jump, slide across the floor or walk on walls, which instantly slows down time.</desc>
