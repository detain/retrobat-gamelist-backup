		<name>A.M.C. : Astro Marine Corps</name>
		<desc>AMC is a 2D game with horizontal scrolling in 2 phases (typical of Spanish games), in the same style as Gryzor. In the first phase, one plays a commando that is sent on the planet DENDAR to trap the ship of the Death Bringers, the bearers of death. There are 11 different enemies to meet you, and Krauer, the Death Bringers leader who protects the ship and is 4 meters tall.

The game starts with a single shot, then the weapon is expanded over the game, we pick up weapons more and more powerful. Note that the contents of the crates sent from the sky by the Astro Marine can be changed by the Death Bringers, so you can die suffocated by green carnivorous plants.

Phase 2 of the game takes you to the Death Bringers ship that drops you on their planet, and you have to exterminate them in a limited time, and contains 13 different enemies and the end boss, Great King Alien.</desc>

		<name>Batman : The Movie</name>
		<desc>Batman also known as Batman: The Movie is an action video game developed by Ocean Software based on the 1989 film of the same name. It was released in 1989 for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, ZX Spectrum.

The game consists of five stages based on events from the movie. Each stage has a time limit and a health gauge (represented by Batman's face turning into the Joker's), with Batman losing a life if he runs out of either. The first stage sees players controlling Batman as he navigates the Axis Chemical Plant to confront Jack Napier, leading to the incident in which he becomes The Joker. In this level, the game features side-scrolling gameplay, in which Batman can use his Batarangs to defeat enemies or and his grapple gun to reach higher platforms and swing across gaps. In the second level, Batman rides in his Batmobile where he must dodge traffic and use a grapple to swing around corners to avoid running into the police. The third level is a puzzle section in which Batman must identify various components for Smilex, the deadly chemical Joker has put into the market. The fourth level takes place during Joker's parade, in which Batman must use the Batwing to cut away balloons filled with poisonous gas without hitting the balloons themselves. Finally, the fifth level, which reprises the gameplay of the first level, sees Batman make his way to the top of Gotham Cathedral to finally confront Joker.</desc>

		<name>Charon 5</name>
		<desc>After an odd start the scenario for this game is fairly standard stuff. Board the mysterious intruder, which is called Ã¢â‚¬â€œ surprise, surprise Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Charon 5, get captured by aliens, become trapped in a tight corner, blast your way out. There are some almost superfluous trimmings such as repair of damaged airlocks and control circuitry, but they are really a euphemism for yet another scrolling shoot-'em-up.

According to my juvenile psychologist I am supposed to be a superior thinker with quick reflexes. Clearly I am neither, judging by my progress so far. The circular ship, known as a HUMAN Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Highly Usable Manoeuvrable Android Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is viewed from above. It moves across a rather boring landscape, almost completely devoid of detail. Only occasionally do these channels open out into rooms where the nasties lurk. They generally look like small balls of cotton wool and are fast, evasive and can take several direct hits before they are destroyed. The consequence is that it is only too easy to get blown up within a few seconds of starting off. Unfortunately the methods of control needed to do this are very complicated and frustrating. You need balletic grace with the joystick.

The most serious condemnation of Charon 5 is that it does not look like an Amiga program. It could easily be mistaken for a competent CPC or C64 offering. The plot is tired, the means of progressing beyond the first screen obscure, the graphics uninteresting and the colours dull.</desc>

		<name>Cloud Kingdoms</name>
		<desc>Baron von Bansai has stolen Terry's precious collection of crystals, and dropped them onto 32 different kingdoms, so Terry sets off to retrieve them. Viewed from above, his challenge sees him having to progress through these worlds, collecting keys to gain access to different sections, and avoiding enemy balls and bugs by jumping them where possible. There are no 'lives' as such, but there's a strict time limit of around 400 seconds for the whole game, and death puts you back to the start of the level, with time lost as well. You get an extra 80 seconds for completing each level though.

The levels feature all manner of further hazards - there are holes in the ground to avoid falling through (some visible, some hidden), arrows which force the ball in a particular direction, slippery squares making any movement's effect exaggerated, magneted squares making it impossible to jump from, and many more. Fortunately lots of power-ups, time boosts and bonus fruits are dropped onto the levels at random intervals as well.

To complete the game you must clear 8 levels, and the structure is non-linear - initially you have a choice of 4 levels, and after completing one of those you have a choice of 4 more levels (which are different depending on which level you completed first). The third and fourth levels you take on as you go through the game are chosen from a choice of 3, the fifth and sixth from a choice of two, and only those final two levels are perscribed (although they do vary depending on which levels you've already done).

Each of the 32 worlds has its own twist - Arrow Kingdom has a large amount of arrows directing you, Ice Kingdom is especially slippery, Unseen Kingdom leaves you to work out the route for yourself (other than the holes, which are all you can see), Box Kingdom involves a lot of flying over some trapped squares to grab the keys they contain before making the main jumps onto the sections which contain crystals, and so on.</desc>

		<name>Dark Seed</name>
		<desc>Dark Seed is an adventure game which capitalizes on the drawings of famous horror designer H. R. Giger as a source of background artwork and inspiration.

You play Mike Dawson, an ad company manager who, in pursuit of his goal in life to become a writer, purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise your suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and you decide to buy the house. That's when trouble begin. Upon reaching the house, you suddenly feel tired. You find a bed and fall asleep...

... and wake up from a terrible dream, only to find out that your life has just become a worse nightmare: an unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in your mind, and you only have three days to find a way to stop it.</desc>

		<name>Flood</name>
		<desc>Quiffy must collect all of the various pieces of litter on the level and then find the exit to complete each level. In general the litter is not particularly hidden, it is just distributed around the level. Quiffy can climb on most walls and ceilings, and swim through water. He has energy which depletes upon touching dangerous objects, but can also die instantly when touching any of the few lethal objects. Although he can swim and has the appearance of an amphibious life-form, he can only breathe above water and will start to drown if he runs out of air.

In each level, you are followed by the ghost of your Aunt Matilda. She copies your movements exactly and starts off about 15 seconds behind you. However, she is very slightly faster than you and will eventually catch up with you. Touching the ghost will hurt Quiffy.

Most of the levels have taps in them, which pour water in to the level. The modelling of the water was quite advanced for a home computer game of its time; the water will flow to the lowest point that it can and when multiple taps are pouring water in one place, it will fill up proportionally fast. A lot of levels feature taps in all areas so the entire level will eventually flood, leaving Quiffy with no available source of air. This aspect is how the game derives its title.</desc>

		<desc>Loom is an adventure game from LucasFilm. What sets Loom apart from other adventure games is its unique interface: you do not carry items around, but rather manipulate existing items through the use of spells. The spells themselves are woven through playing magical notes on a special distaff. Loom also features three difficultly levels, and differentiates them by changing the way the interface works: Standard features the distaff at the bottom of the screen but notes aren't written, whereas Expert doesn't have the distaff and you have to replay the spells by hearing alone.

In Loom you play the role of Bobbin Threadbare, a young man from the Guild of Weavers who just turned 17. Although you do not know why, you are outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times.

After the Council of Elders is attacked and the Elders are turned into swans, you as Bobbin must set forth on a journey to find the swans and try to restore order to the Guild of Weavers.</desc>

The gameplay consists of a combination of arcade elements and first person view much like Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master.  One of the more remarkable features is in the first person mode, rather than having just 4 directs to face and flicking between them there are 8 directions and the view scrolls smoothly as you turn. This smooth scrolling continues when you move forward, giving the game more of a 3D feel.

The arcade elements consist of horizontal scrolling areas where you fight enemies with your bow while avoiding their attacks.  Later you encounter a similar type of gameplay that involves exploring castles and adds 4 directional movement.</desc>

The rarest one came solely packed with the Plan 9 game, while the other edition came with a VHS copy of the film.</desc>

		<name>RVF Honda</name>
		<desc>RVF Honda puts you on board a realistically-modeled RC30 bike, with the task of becoming world champion. Initially you race at Clubman level on fictitious local tracks (one of which is set in MicroProse's old UK home of Tetbury), before moving up to UK and then World championship racing if you're good enough.

Each class of racing has 8 computer opponents, with the top 7 finishers in each of the championship's 8 races scoring points, and the races can be set to 5,10, 15 or 20 laps. The game's graphics appear to feature sprite-based bikes atop polygon scenery, which makes for very fast gameplay. 

The circuits feature puddles of water to upset the bike's handling, and oil, which causes you to crash. It takes time to remount the bike and get back up to speed by revving it back up (more realistic than most motorbike games at the time, but frustrating as you suffer for mistakes more), and after a couple of crashes the bike's dashboard fails, making it much harder to ride competitively.

There is a two-player null-modem link-up mode, which can support an ST racing against an Amiga if you have the right cable.</desc>

		<name>Savage</name>
		<desc>Savage contains three different parts, each with its own style. You can play all three, but to get more than one life on levels 2 or 3, you must first input the code earned on completing the previous level.

You play Savage, a muscular warrior who was imprisoned in a castle. When he broke free, he found out that his imprisonment had been a trick with the sole purpose of imprisoning his love, the maiden. You have to progress through the 3 parts of the game to rescue her. 

The first is a simple horizontal-scrolling shooter, in which you use the trajectory of your shots to kill enemies and collect the treasures and improved weapons they drop when killed. The second is a 1st person perspective 3D shooter resembling Space Harrier, with skulls to shoot and monoliths to avoid. In the third you play Savage's Eagle form, flying through platform-style levels avoiding timing-based hazards and shooting anyone who gets in your way. In this section bubbles can be shot to release power-ups</desc>

She had been taken away from her mother's cottage by the dragon-form of the Beast Mage, Zelek, servant to Maletoth. Along the way, Aarbron befriends the wise dragon Barloom and must defeat the evil dragon Ishran. Tree Pygmies in the forest and the goblins in the Crystal Caverns serve as interactive, complicated foes. For example, a bottle of booze picked up at the Karamoon oasis must be given to the goblin jailer to free Aarbron from his cell. Only after Aarbron gives the old man his ring and his parchment does he obtain a spell powerful enough to harm Zelek.</desc>

		<name>Shadow Warriors</name>
		<desc>Shadow Warriors is a direct port of the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden. It is a beat'em up in the veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world prophecies.

Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with 5 units.

The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.

A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.</desc>

		<name>Slam Tilt - The Pinball Game</name>
		<desc>The final Amiga pinball game released by 21st Century is handled by Liquid Dezign, consisting in part of members from the original Digital Illusions team that made Pinball Illusions. After the relative failure of Pinball Mania, the team banded together one last time to send off the Amiga properly. They don't disappoint here. Even print publications agree: SlamTilt was the last game to score higher than 90% in Amiga Power magazine, before they went out of publication.

Included in SlamTilt are four new tables designed from the start for AGA-capable Amigas, meaning the tables look as smooth as ever. The palettes used here are quite a bit darker, thematically, than others. Lots of navy blues, less saturated colors. And Liquid Dezign doesn't pull any punches as far as content, either: all of the tables have multiball modes, ball savers, kickback features, video modes, and more combo bonuses than you can swing a flipper at. (Terrible joke, yes.) The ball looks a lot nicer and actually appears to be rolling instead of simply being a tiny bitmap flying around the screen. Flashers and table lights will appear to illuminate everything else. The dot matrix display above the table is animated really smoothly and has all kinds of fun little videos that play for things like bumpers being hit, or losing your ball.</desc>

Now Ace/Dexter must not only rescue his girlfriend Kimberly but also prevent the destruction of the Earth at the hands of Borf.

Readysoft's version of the laserdisc arcade game Space Ace for 16-bit computers follows the mold of their earlier Dragon's Lair adaptation: only selected scenes from the original game are used, with all the graphics redrawn from the original cel animation to fit the capabilities of the target machines.

As in Dragon's Lair, the game consists of the cartoon movie running by itself, with the player being required to press the right button at the right time (either moving or firing Ace's gun) or see one of many death animations. The original arcade game offered some alternate paths through the game by letting the player choose between playing as Dexter or turning him back into Ace - the computer version is missing this option, and one always plays as Dexter or Ace depending on the scene.</desc>

One player controlled a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles passed over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also included a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.</desc>

		<name>New Zealand Story, The</name>
		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

		<name>Turrican II : The Final Fight</name>
		<desc>Turrican II: The Final Fight is a platformer/shooter as typically seen on consoles, but designed for home computers from the ground up.

Its plot is - naturally - very simple: an evil mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who's the boss.

Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker.</desc>

		<desc>Basketball was the second sport to which Cinemaware applied their philosophy of lavish production and advanced cutscenes. Exhibition and league matches are on offer, with the opportunity to recreate a full league season with 1 player assigned to each of the 28 clubs. The game uses varying camera positions, with top-down views when the ball is close to either hoop, and a side-view when the ball is mid-court - controls remain unchanged for these, so the switch doesn't cause a sudden change in player movement.

As well as playing the matches you have full coaching control. This can involve making substitutions but also assigning marking and game strategies.</desc>

Similar to the first Uridium, you face increasing numbers of unfriendly fighter wings and stationary defenses while sweeping over the carriers. The real challenge here is to avoid the many walls on the back of the vessel while you are under attack.
After the exterior has been cleaned from most of the enemy presence you take care of the ships' reactor core in a jump-and-run-like sequence. While floating in a non-gravity surrounding, lower the core's shields and then destroy it.
The game also gives you a number of extra weapons that can be collected by either flying over pick-ups left from dead enemy wings or by catching them after the power generator has been destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>A rather unique war game simulation. You can decide to be several different people and the game is created after the way you make your choice. The game engine and interface are pretty simple as all you have to do is to deploy units, offer support to your allies and decide on what military you are going to need.

Depending on what you choose to do the news will change in the a newspaper you can read (the is how the game tells about all events in the game) which is rather nice, because that makes the overview of the game very good. The game does offer pretty good graphics all though it isn't really needed for a game like this. But is definitely a plus.</desc>

		<name>1869 : Erlebte Geschichte Teil I</name>
		<desc>1869 is a strategy and economics trading game developed by the Austrian company Max Design GesMBH and published by Flare Software for Amiga OCS/ECS/AGA series of computers in 1993.

You cannot beat the feeling of power money brings, and there is plenty of money to be made in the A1200 version of 1869. It is the late 19th Century and the world is wracked with civil wars and international conflicts. In many ways, there has never been a more exciting time to launch a business venture.

You play the owner of a fledgling shipping company and you have to use your skills as a tactician and businessman to exploit the various trading situations around the world. If you succeed then your business expands, but if you fail, you could end up losing more than just your livelihood.

The A1200 version of this game does not actually seem to be that much different from the original version â€“ you get the same brief animation sequences and humorous interludes. You even listen to the same irritatingly nautical chip music. However, 1869 can be best appreciated in multi-player mode with you and up to three other pals battling it out for the ultimate control of the high seas.

If you're heavily into 19th century nautical history, or play on an Amiga with other enlightened beings, and the idea of pretending to be a hard-nosed, back-stabbing, scrupulous capitalist appeals to you, then go buy this game. Just be prepared to play like a real Thatcherite.</desc>

On the main menu there are four icons as well as some major information such as the player's name, the name of the player's club, current league position, a rating, and the account balance.

The first icon from left is the picture of a computer and by clicking on it you will get to the main database menu where you can handle the playersâ€™ training, studying the coming fixtures and edit the teams or players. The second icon is a telephone and by clicking on it and you will be able to make a phone call to either the transfer market (for buying and selling players) or the the bank (to get a loan). The third icon is a notebook and by clicking on it you will see tables from all four divisions. The last icon is the picture of a football pitch and by pressing it you will get to your next match. After choosing your squad you will see the highlights of the match from a top-down perspective.

After the match you will get reports about players being injured, results in the other matches, and the finances for that week.</desc>

Seen from a first-person cockpit perspective and utilizing flat-shaded polygonal graphics, waves of aliens advance towards the player and must be destroyed with a laser cannon. Unlike in the originals, the aliens never shoot back: the only danger they pose is that of crashing into the player. If any aliens from a wave survive an attack run by not being destroyed before they pass the player, they will try again and again, until either the entire wave or the player is destroyed. The alien formations change every four waves, but not before a bonus stage involving navigating an asteroid field is passed.</desc>

The pace, spin and angle of each shot can be set up precisely before playing it. Both 8-ball (pot your seven colors plus the black to win) and 9-ball (pot the 9-ball with a shot that also hits the lowest remaining ball, whatever that may be) are included.

There are seven skill levels to work through. A trick-shot mode is also included, with 20 pre-set shots. Prior to each match it is possible to bet on the outcome.</desc>

		<desc>4-D Boxing leaves behind any pretences of being a pure arcade game based on boxing, and aims to recreate the sport in full detail. The graphics engine allows for multiple camera angles and viewpoints, and considerably detailed visuals. These required more advanced hardware than was common at the time, but a stick-figure mode was included as a compromise. The moves on offer include all the uppercuts and hooks of a real fight, and the players are designed to move realistically to implement them.

You progress through the game by taking on a succession of increasingly difficult fighters, and get to train your boxer in between. Advanced action replays are included as well, so you can review all that happened.</desc>

		<name>4th &amp; Inches</name>
		<desc>Like other sports games by Bob Whitehead, 4th &amp; Inches was hailed upon release, combining the action of previous titles with the new feature of strategic play calling. For the first time in a computer football game, players could choose from a number of plays. The player initially designated a formation, and then selected one of five plays based on the formation. These plays included a great number of offensive strategies, including draws, curls, sweeps and long bombs, among others. Defensive tactics equally were varied, with the player being able to choose a defensive formation based on what they thought the opponent would attempt.



The game required the player to select a position to control before the play began while on offense, but were not able to switch control during the action. Because there was a limited area of the field in view at any one time, it occasionally prevented the player from seeing important parts of the play develop. Rather than scrolling smoothly when the player being controlled would reach the edge of the screen, as modern football simulations do, it re-drew the visible section of the field entirely, placing the controlled player in a new position on the screen. While on defense, the player being controlled could not be changed either, but would be automatically selected as the player closest to the offensive ball carrier on each screen redraw.</desc>

You can also buy upgrades and repairs, including carrying some spares.



There are four completely different types of course, each taking place on a different surface - Mud, Ice, Desert and Mountains. Each of these is littered with hazards, which can either be painstakingly avoided, or driven through (with the resultant risk of damage).</desc>

		<name>500 C.C MotoManager</name>
		<desc>In this game the player manages a 500cc motorcycling team, starting with a certain budget of around $4,000,000. The gameplay includes the economical and technical management, motorcycle riding simulation on the famous circuits such as Phillip Island, etc., and management of the racer actions during the race.

In adjustment phase you should select one of 20 racers from around the world (USA, UK, Italy, France, Australia, Japan, Germany) to enlist and select one of 14 motorcycles (Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki, Kawasaki, Cagiva, Gilera) to buy. The enlistment bonus price of racers differs based on their position and skills described by four parameters: Power, Ability, Reaction, and Courage. The price of bike differs based on its parts described by five parameters: Power, Speed, Handyness, Resistance, and Adherence. Starting with the bad racers you will eventually progress to a professionals.

In simulation phase you should accelerate/decelerate the bike, shift the gears, correctly go into bends, and finish the lap as fast as possible to get a better starting position.

In management phase you should keep an eye on the race progress and messages from the commentator, give guidelines to the racer on when to accelerate/decelerate, examine the bike's state, and win the race to earn the points and prize.

'Single track' and 'Championship' modes are allowed as well as gameplay for 1-2 players. In 2 players mode each player takes part in the game sequentially.</desc>

Cash is earned by completing levels, with an initial $10,000 available. These funds are spent at garages to buy extra fuel, repair the car's armour, and put add-ons for the car. These include a turbo-jump (allowing the car to get airborne unassisted, rather than relying on jumps) and waterproofing.</desc>

		<name>7 Colors</name>
		<desc>The color chosen is locked for the opponent for one turn; drawing lines from one border of the field to another fills all the space in between. In addition, boards come in various diamond sizes, color textures and with obstacle stones. A (generous) time limit exerts soft pressure.

In the wake of Alexey Pajitnov's block-busting Tetris, Infogrames licensed another Russian mathematician's concept for a game of logics and dexterity: Two players start from opposite ends of a board, filled with rectangles of seven different colors, and take turns in picking one of these colors. All diamonds of that color bordering on the player's territory are annexed, expanding the borders. Whoever first controls more than half of the terrain wins.</desc>

		<name>9 Lives</name>
		<desc>Claudette the cat has been kidnapped by scientists aiming to use her for experiments. Bob Cat can't allow this, and sets off to save her.

9 Lives is a platform game taking in four levels. The lengths of jumps are variable, depending on how long the joystick is pushed down for. Bonus items to be collected include rotor blades, to allow flight. 

Bob cannot kill his enemies, but can temporarily stun them, by hurling his ball of string at them. Contact with enemies or hazards causes an energy bar to decrease - a life is lost once it reaches zero. As the title suggests, this can happen eight times before a ninth death ends the game.</desc>

		<desc>This simulation puts you in the cockpit of the A-10 Thunderbolt II, which is also known as the "Warthog". As the game's name implies, it is used mainly to hunt enemy tanks, but also for destroying roads and bridges

You are armed with 30mm Avenger cannon which can fire around 70 times a second. Multiple camera angles are featured. Landing is automated and an accelerated time function is on offer.

Characters have full AI to act without your involvement, and will communicate with you in-flight. Actions in one mission affect another - something you failed to destroy in one mission can attack you later.</desc>

		<desc>Play the part of the head of a railroad company, with the aim of creating a railroad empire, providing a successful mass transit system that will be an inspiration to the rest of the world. Another goal is to provide the impetus for a chosen city to develop. There are a number of different places to set up business each with different layouts and existing houses and businesses.

The main money earners are passenger trains, that can be scheduled to pick up passengers at the times of day when the demand is high. However, in the long term you need the city to develop. This requires setting up trains that transport resources to where they are needed. These resources are used to build houses, and other buildings, increasing the number of passengers for commuter trains.

As the city develops, new businesses will spring up, such as stadiums, high rise office blocks, and ski resorts. The player may also build own businesses, the success of which will depend on the local population, the presence of competing businesses, and even the changes of the seasons, among other factors.

The stock market is also another way of making money. The player may also watch the seasons come and go, with snow visible in winter, and fireworks displays celebrating the New Year.</desc>

		<desc>A320 Airbus Vol. 2 is the second main game in the Airbus series following the first two that were split up based on the territory to cover. This flight simulator improves the original game by more authentic navigation systems, improved flight and control. Also, some improvements in usability in preparing a flight are included. Four new areas are added in Europe: Italy, Spain, Portugal and the Canaries. These four areas add 29 new airports and 200 new radio beacons.

The game includes a duty mode starting as a rookie to become a chief pilot. Evaluation is based on various factors such as the runaway landing angle or the conservation of reserve fuel. In the training mode the weather parameters can be set manually, but in duty mode they are selected randomly and need to be taken into account when setting the flight path. Players also need to tap in the coordinates to set up the navigational system.</desc>

This is located inside a building, and to find the right one you must continuously smash them up, using either the ogre's horn or the dragon's tail. Humans must also be attacked as you see them, as their catapults weaken you. Food can be found to restore energy,

Once you have located the egg, a one-on-one beat 'em up battle with your rival ensues - win five of these to finally win the game.</desc>

		<desc>In this RPG, you play the role of four heroes whose mission is to save their world, Kalynthia, from the evil arch mage Bronagh. Most of the time, while exploring the over world, the game is shown in a 2D top-down view. It gives you much freedom: there's more to do than just stick to the main quest. Towns have a static interface where you reach the wished location by pressing the according symbol. e.g. a church for healing up or a sage for hints.

During dungeon crawls the game switches to a 3D view and plays similar to Dungeon Master. As usual for this kind of games you see the dungeon in a small windows while your characters are shown on the right hand side of the screen. Dungeon sequences are completely in real-time. This includes combat which basically consists of clicking on a character's weapon or magic spell and then clicking on the monster. After every usage of a weapon/spell you have to wait a certain time until you can use it again.</desc>

		<name>Abandoned Places : Zeit fuer Helden</name>
		<desc>In this RPG, you play the role of four heroes whose mission is to save their world, Kalynthia, from the evil arch mage Bronagh. Most of the time, while exploring the over world, the game is shown in a 2D top-down view. It gives you much freedom: there's more to do than just stick to the main quest. Towns have a static interface where you reach the wished location by pressing the according symbol. e.g. a church for healing up or a sage for hints.

During dungeon crawls the game switches to a 3D view and plays similar to Dungeon Master. As usual for this kind of games you see the dungeon in a small windows while your characters are shown on the right hand side of the screen. Dungeon sequences are completely in real-time. This includes combat which basically consists of clicking on a character's weapon or magic spell and then clicking on the monster. After every usage of a weapon/spell you have to wait a certain time until you can use it again.</desc>

		<desc>In this dungeon-crawling RPG you must assemble a team of four brave fighters to launch an attack on Pendugmalhe, and save the kingdom of Kalynthia. The main gameplay is influenced by Dungeon Master, but features sections in the open air battling bears as well as the dungeons.

In the real-time combat sections you must choose weapons and spells instantaneously, using the mouse-based interface. You will find many villages along the way, and you can gain clues and buy supplies at these. The game's difficulty is pitched at experienced role-players; ideally those with an experienced party from the first game to load in.</desc>

		<desc>Pete Cooke's follow-up to the previous space shooter-explorer takes things away from the Tau Ceti setting. Players take the role of a student at an academy for advanced piloting. There they need to solve 20 simulated missions on a wide range of planets.

The self-contained missions mean that the game uses the Tau Ceti structure and theme, without the causality of previous decisions having an effect on later choices. This reduces the complexity of management. Although players can customize the ships, including giving them names of your choice, the game comes with supplied ones include a variety that should suit many different circumstances.

Whichever vehicle is chosen, players will control it from a 1st person perspective and a series of controls. All ships skim over the surface of the planet and feature weapons. Most missions will involve destroying rogue robots enemies. Players will have to dock with buildings to refuel or move on to a different planet.</desc>

		<desc>Accordion is a solitaire card game. Cards are dealt face up one at a time and the aim of the game is to condense all cards into a single pile. To build piles, cards are moved from the left to a card or a pile on the right. Piles can be moved one or two cards to the left if the card on the left is of the same suit or if the card on the left is the same number. The game begins with four cards dealt and the player can then choose to make a move or deal another card. If there are no legal moves that can be made from dealt cards, more cards will automatically be dealt.</desc>

You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</desc>

In northeastern Ansalon, outposts of the Knights of Solamnia remain to guard the fragile peace. Your party of adventurers is hired to carry out missions for the Knights. On your first mission, you stumble upon Draconians, long believed to have left the area. What are their plans? On your travels you have to face dangers in many dungeons and towns and might even meet some of the legendary Heroes of the Lance.

Champions of Krynn is the first of SSI's "gold box" games set in the AD&amp;D world of Dragonlance, with all the usual features: first-person view and movement in dungeons, towns and outposts, overland travel on a map of the area and tactical turn-based combat from a top-down perspective.

As the first game set in Krynn, it has several features unique to that setting: In character races, one can choose from Kender, Silvanesti or Qualinesti Elves and Mountain or Hill Dwarves in addition to humans and half-elves. Special character classes include Solamnic Knights, clerics of the major deities of Krynn and mages of either the Red or the White Robe. The deities grant special spells and powers to their respective clerics. Red and White mages have access to different spells and the phases of the moons of Krynn affect their spellcasting abilities.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : Curse of the Azure Bonds</name>
		<desc>Outside of the town of Tilverton, the party of heroes has been ambushed, captured and cursed with five azure markings called "bonds". These bonds have dangerous magical powers that can take control of the heroes at the most inopportune times. They must now search for the source of the bonds, and free themselves from the curse.

The second in the  Gold Box series of role-playing games, Curse of the Azure Bonds is a sequel to  Pool of Radiance. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor and other Gold Box games. Following the  AD&amp;D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Two new character classes (Paladin and Ranger) are added to the four basic AD&amp;D classes Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Cleric, which were available in Pool of Radiance. Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. There is also an overview "world map" that allows instant traveling between cities.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : Death Knights of Krynn</name>
		<desc>Death Knights of Krynn is the 2nd volume of the Dragonlance epic and is the sequel to Champions of Krynn. Characters from that game may be imported to this game.



This time the party faces an undead threat that turns former friends into fierce enemies and infests Krynn with hordes of decaying monsters. The party must find the origin of these nightmarish undead creatures and eliminate it in order to save Krynn from turning into a land of undead. 



Like Champions of Krynn, Death Knights of Krynn introduces a different and unique character selection with the availability of the "Knight" class, unavailable in AD&amp;D non-Dragonlance RPGs. Characters in this game may level-up to higher levels and obtain new skills as well as more powerful spells. Experienced Knights may ultimately choose one out of 3 "clans" to focus more on a different type of fighting style.</desc>

		<name>Dragons of Flame</name>
		<desc>Dragons of Flame is a Role-Playing game, developed by U.S. Gold and published by SSI, which was released in 1989.

SSI continue their series of AD&amp;D releases with Dragons of Flame, an action game (like Heroes of the Lance, the first release) set in a mythical world. It's 300 years since the gods abandoned the people of Krynn and as a result, Takhisis, the Queen of Darkness, has awakened some dragons and created an army of Draconians. Once her armies are victorious, she'll be able to rule the land. All that can stop her is a bunch of companions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ led by your very own self.

The character portraits are all good and while the overhead and side views are basic, they're quite reasonable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at least the sprites respond quickly to key presses. Sound is limited to a few spot effects and these are nothing to write home about.

It's simple stuff so it's easy to get into. It's also easy to play and with a bit of application shouldn't take too long to complete. That said, it's not too easy and the difficulty tuning has been set about right. It's definitely an action game and the role-playing elements that creep in give it a nice bit of variation on a straight hack 'n' slash game.

Dragons of Flame is definitely enjoyable to start with, but the sheer number of enemies that have to be dealt with takes the edge off the excitement and the whole thing starts to get a shade on the repetitive side. Still, it's certainly a nice easy game to get into and works well as an introduction to the sort of things that happen in 'real' role-playing games.</desc>

The gameplay consists of horizontal fighting with a maze like map using doors to change the view. The party consists of the 8 Heroes of the Lance, using one at a time and the player can switch between them at any time. Each character has different types of attacks and spells making them more suited to fighting different enemies as well as acting as lives.

One of the AD&amp;D games that takes a break from the usual RPG style.</desc>

		<desc>Players start their game by creating a character. The game provides three choices: players may select a pre-made character, create their own, or import characters from previous Strategic Simulations Dungeons &amp; Dragons computer games, such as Pool of Radiance and Curse of the Azure Bonds. When creating a character, players may determine the character's race, character class (cleric, fighter, magic-user or thief), and alignment. Various characteristics of the new character, such as strength and intelligence, are assigned a random value by the computer.
There are two aspects to the game: arcade action, where the player performs tasks (expressed as mini-games) such as searching for treasure and traveling between locations, and adventure, where the player completes quests. The choice of character class affects the available quests, with three for each class. While the quests need to be completed in a set order, "what you do in your time off is up to you".</desc>

There are two aspects to the game: arcade action, where the player performs tasks (expressed as mini-games) such as searching for treasure and traveling between locations, and adventure, where the player completes quests. The choice of character class affects the available quests, with three for each class. While the quests need to be completed in a set order, "what you do in your time off is up to you".</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : Pools of Darkness</name>
		<desc>Pools of Darkness is the fourth of Gold Box series of classic-style AD&amp;D-based role-playing games. The gameplay is quite similar to other games of this type. At the start of the game, the player creates a party of characters (up to 6). Classic AD&amp;D races (dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, etc.), character classes (fighter, paladin, monk, wizard, etc.), alignments (Good/Evil and Lawful/Chaotic axis), and statistics (strength, intelligence, wisdom, etc.) are there for the player to choose and adjust. Once the party is created, the player begins the exploration of the city of Phlan. Upon exiting the city, the player explores a top-down map, visiting dungeons and other locations of interest, as well as engaging in combat.</desc>

		<desc>Shadow Sorcerer is a tie-in with the Dragonlance series of novels. The player controls a party of four adventurers that have just rescued 800 slaves and must shepherd them through the wilderness before the evil Dragon army catches up with them. There are three levels to the game:

-Strategic, where the player must move the refugees safely through the wilderness.
- Tactical, where the party explores dungeons and other areas of interest, searching for information and treasure to assist the escape.
- Political, where the players must deal with the refugee leaders and convince them to continue following the party.

All three take place in real-time with the evil dragons constantly on the adventurers' heels slowly picking off the escapees.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Fruit Machine Simulator</name>
		<desc>It's not a mega thrilling 3D shooter, but it does what it says on the box! This game was released on nearly every popular computer at the time, but it's good to see that it hasn't lost the fun on the port to the Amiga.

It is a game for 1 - 4 players. Each player is given Â£1.50 stake money which is represented as a series of coins. These coins are fed into the machine by pressing the appropriate action key, zero feeds in Â£1 for example. Once the machine has been fed all the player has to do is spin the reels and see what happens. When a winning combination appears the game offers the chance to gamble it for a higher or lower win. Rather than getting a gambling addiction and hanging with crackheads and the like, have a go at this game - It's fun, fun, fun all the way and you won't have the debt collectors chasing you!</desc>

There are around 6 extra items you can find in the game, most of which aren't essential but make the game a lot easier.

		<name>The Adventures of Willy Beamish</name>
		<desc>Willy Beamish is a kid who likes to goof off and have fun. Naturally all the grown-ups get in the way by making him go to school, making him clean his room, etc. But now that's school's out for the summer, Willy is determined to have a good time and maybe even have his pet frog win the frog jumping contest. However Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a challenge to get out of it.

The Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You play Willy Beamish, an eight year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he'll have to deal with parents, teachers, babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded. 

The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is a bar which shows Willy's relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.</desc>

		<name>African Raiders-01</name>
		<desc>The game tries to represent the African part of 11th Paris-Dakar rally route, which in the game takes place in Tunisia, Algeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal in 1988-1989.

Controlling his(her) car in third-person 'behind the car' view, player should drive through the marked path in Sahara. When player loses his(her) way, he(she) may be in the sands alone and start to skid. In this situation he(she) may switch between 4x4 and 4x2 modes of the car. These modes have own opportunities and misses. The speed is limited to 87 in 4x4 mode and limited by car's parameters in 4x2 mode. But in 4x4 mode path marks may stop the car, while in 4x2 mode the car may knock the path parks off. Switching the gear, player may drive back and forth to avoid blocking of car either by path mark or by debris in the sand. Direction of the way is shown by compass as well as length of traversed path and volume of residuary fuel are displayed by indicators.

Other drivers are present on the way during day and night, therefore they should be left behind to win in the rally. There are five stages with different visible horizons:
1) Tunis - In Salah (5726 Km); 
2) Ouallene - Achegour (4353 Km); 
3) Achegour - Niamey (4587 Km); 
4) Ouagadougou - Bamako  (4438 Km); 
5) Bamako - Dakar (3622 Km).

So, you have to conquer the sands of Sahara, show good time on each stage, and to be the first at the finish.</desc>

		<name>After the War</name>
		<desc>Year 2019, Manhattan. After a nuclear war.

Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as "Jungle Rogers", the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.

There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later you await the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.</desc>

This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

		<name>Air Bucks</name>
		<desc>Air Bucks is a business simulation game which tries to capture the ins and outs of the airline industry without bogging the player down with details. It starts in 1946 and the goal is to build up a successful airline with a small starting budget. There are many details in the game, e.g. the player can buy rights to airports, arrange seats on the planes to carry more or less first class passengers, decide on the quality of in-flight food or entertainment, and more.

The game features "special events" similar to Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon, which require quick changes in the plane operations to accommodate them. Other important industry-specific activities include designing global routes and paying for landing rights, tinkering with plane layouts and determining fares for each leg. All those decisions are made inside various menu screens. Competition consists of up to three human or AI controlled opponents and the world map is randomly generated with every new game.</desc>

These items have to be collected in the maze which consists of 150 isometric rooms. These can be explored freely but sometimes you need to have special objects to proceed, e.g. a candle in dark rooms. The dangers consist mostly of sharp objects which can cause your ball to burst. Additionally you are on a timer because your balloon loses air constantly. But it can be refilled by using pumps which can be found in the maze - but you have to leave them in time or you explode because of overpressure.</desc>

		<name>Airborne Ranger</name>
		<desc>In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases:

    Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.
    Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.
    Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s

Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).

Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.</desc>

		<desc>In Air Force Commander the player takes command of a Middle Eastern country's air force to gain air superiority over the enemy. Like the title suggests this game focuses solely on aircraft and rocket bases. The main part of the game is spent on the overhead map where the player gives orders to his units, e.g. attacking ground targets and scouting or intercepting enemy forces. Different map views show information like targets in range, flight movements in the monitored zones or civil facilities. Another important aspect of the game is resource management: every base and unit cost resources. If these get scarce the player can shut down some bases. If the public mood gets too bad, e.g. because of destroyed civil facilities or food shortage, the player loses his commission and therefore the game.</desc>

The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan's dungeon to the final confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar's palace. The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.

The game's humorous animations were created by Walt Disney Feature Animation.</desc>

		<name>Albedo</name>
		<desc>Albedo is a planet, and on this planet a man called Dick is holding a tournament and for those who master all the levels, a secret will be shared.

The player's avatar has a nice spacesuit, as well as magnetic shoes. These are handy, as they allow the player to run not only on the floor, but also on the walls and the roof. An alternative to running is a jump, which let you drift (and turn) until you reach the other side of the screen. Your only gun is shooting some kind of laser, presented as a line, which is reflected from the walls.

There are four basic levels which has to be mastered, which means a given score has to be reached before the other levels open and finally Dick can be reached. The levels vary in the form of the walls, some are more circular, other more like a rectangle. The enemies are different in each level, and can attack with sheer size (Grok) or an amount of small enemies (Virus).

Four separate two-player levels can be chosen, which can be played as death-match. If no second player is around, the computer can control player two.</desc>

		<name>Alcatraz</name>
		<desc>A drug baron took over Alcatraz prison and now the player takes the role of an U.S. Navy Seal to break in and neutralize him. He has two hours to complete his objectives in three buildings and needs to survive two different playing styles: side-scrolling fighting on the streets and first-person shooting inside.

Outside, the goal is to reach the building in which the objectives have to be completed. Of course the baron's thugs are not too pleased and try to kill the hero - so he has to shoot back with a many different weapons, e.g. flamethrowers, machine guns, bombs, and other destructive or close combat weapons, which can be collected from dead enemies. Similarly to Hostage: Rescue Mission, he can also hide in the background in certain spots.

Once inside a building, the game switches to a first-person view, in which the player has to navigate a maze to reach his goal, e.g. recovering evidence. To his disposal are a radar and a rifle.</desc>

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</desc>

		<name>Alianator</name>
		<desc>Aliantor is a Defender variant, but instead of side-scrolling in a 3D-environment. Besides the usual alien attack on a space station there is no background story. The player is cast as the only defender of the eight inhabitants and has to prevent them from being kidnapped by the aliens.

Each of the levels can be freely navigated (the ship's speed is automatically throttled when the invisible walls are reached) and the inhabitants stand around on pre-defined places. The aliens have various ship types with different behaviour patterns which either try to destroy the player's ship or collect the inhabitants and bring them into the aliens' invincible station. There they are transformed into especially powerful enemies (mutants). Besides the first-person view on environment, there are some instruments at the bottom of the screen, e.g. a list of present enemy types, a radar, speed, altitude or shield level. The latter represents the life energy and causes death when fully depleted. Additional lives are gained after earning enough points by shooting enemies. Besides dying, another way to lose the game is failing to keep at least one inhabitants alive.</desc>

		<name>Alien 3</name>
		<desc>Alien3 is a video game based on the movie of the same name. The plot of the movie picks up directly after the end of Aliens. Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship. Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

The gameplay of the various Alien³ conversions varies from platform to platform. This version is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien attacks.</desc>

		<name>Alien Breed</name>
		<desc>Alien Breed is a top-down science fiction shooter somewhat inspired by the movie Alien in terms of plot and atmosphere. Gameplay, though, was obviously inspired by the Atari arcade classic Gauntlet. The game tells a typical sci-fi story of an alien invasion on the space station ISRC-4. Two space marines, Johnson and Stone, are the only human beings left to clear the base of aliens.

Moving around an alien-infested complex in a top-down view, you must at all times keep an eye not only on your energy level, but also be conservative with ammunition. Though you will find new ammo cartridges strewn around the levels, they are consumed quickly by respawning aliens that may come crawling out of the floors and walls when you least expect it. On the floors, you will also find keys for passing through locked doors. Keys must also be used with care, or you may find yourself locked out of a room containing the remaining keys that you will need in order to complete the level. Other doors are one-way, and will electrocute you if you try to pass it in the other direction.</desc>

This release was in a similar vein, but set into a 3D context, making for the Amiga's first big Doom-style game. The 3D engine uses fairly small screen graphics, but these include full floors and ceilings with detailed shading, doors, vertical position variations, lifts and transporters. The CD version includes extra atmospheric sound, while fast processors and extra FastRAM are also supported.</desc>

		<desc>Alien Legion is a side scrolling platform shooter similar to Hewson's Exolon which was released a few years earlier. Earth has been attacked and overrun by the evil forces of Marania. All the planet's soldiers were taken as prisoners, all except one, Captain Cosmose who happens to be the player. Now it's up to him and his laser gun Sycho to save the world. Gameplay involves walking from left to right, shooting at the various enemies that appear in the player's path and jumping between platforms to find the right route and avoid falling into a pit. Enemies range from regular aliens, armoured ones, aliens riding strange vehicles to more abstract flying things. Sometimes potions appear from killed aliens, which can be either green or red. If the player touches a green potion he regains some health but if he touches a red one he loses some. When all out of health, one of three lives is lost.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Games/Alien Storm (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Alien Storm</name>
		<desc>Alien Storm is a side-scrolling beat 'em up.[2] The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.

All of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are nine missions to complete (eight in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying an UFO.

After defeating certain aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.

In a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons an U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.

There are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss in the middle of the game that has three distinct forms. This boss is repeated as common enemy near the end of the last mission. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.</desc>

		<desc>You, Kai are about to marry your sweetheart Medb, but Slough Feg and his minions have kidnapped her and taken her to the far side of The Cave of Dreams. Swearing a bit too loud about rescuing her, Slough Feg has heard you and turned you into an insect. With the help of magic from the Druid Lords though, you set off on your quest.

To help you, some minions leave behind either a power-up for your weapon or Zen, the currency of The Cave of Dreams. Zen can be spent in the shops that litter the landscape. Here you can buy health or extra weapons. Kai has three lives which are lost when his two energy dots turn from white, cycle through various colours before turning black.

Alien World is a scrolling shoot-em-up. Various levels scroll horizontally while others scroll vertically. The screen will only scroll when you move so far across the screen. You cannot re-trace your steps. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, amount of Zen, Energy dots, lives and various weapons. The joystick moves Kai, but not touching the joystick lets gravity kick in. The fire button fires your weapon.</desc>

		<desc>In Aliex, the player takes the role of a space pilot who was shot down over a planet. The good news is that the crash-landing was not instantly deadly. The bad news is that the enemy sends in their whole force to kill the player for good.

The game requires a lightgun which is used to shoot the numerous enemies appearing on the screen. There are a few enemy types which need more or less hits to be defeated; some of them unleash powerful attacks when they are not disposed of within a certain time frame. Of course the other enemies are also able to damage the player's life energy and running out causes death. Along with ammo, it can be refilled by shooting packages which drop in after a certain amount of points are earned. The background (first desert, then jungle) automatically scrolls from left to right and than back; the goal is to survive this ordeal often enough.</desc>

		<name>Alpha Waves</name>
		<desc>Alpha Waves is a 3D game viewed from third-person perspective. The player pilots a "Mobile", a craft which bounces off of the platforms that fill the rooms. The player can rotate the craft left and right, thrust it forward, and move the camera up and down for optimal viewing. The game contains 256 rooms, which the player explores while in search of 16 crystals and 16 cubes. The Mobile bounces from platform to platform, making its way around the room to the doors that lead into other rooms. On the way, the player encounters many other creatures and vehicles, as well as surprises, such as rooms with reversed gravity.

There are two modes of play: Emotion and Action.

    In Action, players start in the central room, and work their way around with a time limit. Players gain time when going into a room they haven't been in before, and when crystal or cube power-ups are picked up. When time runs out, the Mobile explodes and the game ends.
    In Emotion, players can choose to start in any of the 12 regions into which the 256 rooms are grouped. The regions are arranged in the context of different areas of the human brain. While there is no timer, players also can't explore beyond the region that is chosen.</desc>

The Altered Beast title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in single player mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</desc>

No big deal? Quite on the contrary. When the unsuspecting Mr. Barrett returns home and turns the TV on, he is sucked into a portal! One moment later he finds himself on the strange planet of Daltere. Naturally, this planet needs a savior: the evil alien Helmar has stolen an artifact known as the Jewel of Light, thus endangering the entire galaxy. Now our unlikely hero has to overcome various obstacles and to save the world.

Altered Destiny is a puzzle-solving adventure game. The interface is very similar to the one used in Les Manley games by the same company. The navigation can be done with the mouse (point-and-click), but the game still requires text input to issue commands to the hero and to interact with the world.</desc>

Those can be stunned with Spider-Man's iconic web substance, but touching them or other hazards in the game world will decrease his heath. Another important part of the gameplay are puzzles, mostly with the goal to deactivate some of Mysterio's gimmicks, e.g. changed gravity, to clear the path.

As the lavishly-drawn comic bundled with the game explains, Spider-Man and Captain America must join forces to go to Latveria and foil his plans.

The main action in the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you alternately control the two characters. They each have their own moves to deal with The Rhino, Electro and other foes. Moves are context-sensitive based on the distance between your character and the opponent. Energy bars decrease as you each take hits. After each section you get comic-book sequences as a reward, and to set the scene of the evolving story.</desc>

		<name>Ambermoon</name>
		<desc>Ambermoon is the second game in Thalion's never-finished Amber trilogy that was started out by Amberstar. The sequel is set more than half a century after the first game, the world of Lyramion just starting to recover from the destruction caused by the collapse of the red moon. The original protagonist is an old, dying man as the game starts out. He summons his grandchild and tells him about a vision he had, of an old friend who supposedly died more than forty years ago and warned him of a great evil rising again. He sends the youth on a quest to seek that old friend and find out what is behind that vision.

Concerning gameplay, Ambermoon is similar to its predecessor. The player initially controls only the main character, having the choice between a male and a female protagonist with several portraits each, but otherwise unable to customize them at that point. During the course of the game, additional characters may be recruited in various places in Lyramion; up to six form an active party that participates in combat. All characters can train physical attributes by specific NPCs in various towns, while some can also buy, learn, and cast offensive, supportive, and healing magic spells.</desc>

Initially the player creates a single protagonist with randomly assigned attributes and no class designation. During the course of the game, additional characters (up to six active party members) can be found in different cities and other locations and recruited. Some of these characters already belong to established classes and come with their own abilities. Guilds of various classes (fighter, paladin, ranger, mage, monk, and thief) can be visited, where the protagonist and his class-less companions (if any) can be promoted. Choice of classes affects attributes, character growth, imposes equipment restrictions, etc. When leveling up, characters can train in specific locations, increasing attributes of the player's choice.</desc>

		<desc>Amegas is a Breakout variant which conforms to, and expands on the play mechanics of the established Arkanoid canon. 

The basic lay remains to control a bat which slides back and forth at the bottom of the screen. Stacks of coloured bricks are arranged in patterns above. The object is being to bounce a ball to hit the bricks to make them disappear. Some bricksâ€™ require multiple hits to destroy - visually indicated by dots shown on the face. Some special bricks are distinguished from others by unique icons, e.g. one with aâ€™ skullâ€™ will result in a loss of life if hit by the ball, or one with an â€˜xâ€™ mark will cause new bricks to spawn &amp; spread. 

At times bricks will yield colour-coded pickups which topple down and may be caught, resulting in a special power-up feature being given. A unique play facet presented here is that power-upsâ€™ are not activated automatically, but rather are reserved - The player may utilise the last power-up collected upon clicking the right mouse button, this remains true even if a ball is lost.</desc>

		<name>American Tag-Team Wrestling</name>
		<desc>Released at a budget price around the peak of the WWF's original popularity, the twist in this wrestling game is the tag-team nature of competition. Each player selects two wrestlers from those on offer, and when the one in the ring is weakened he can go to the edge of the ring and tag his team-mate, who then enters the ring and allows the other to recover.

You can either play individual matches (for one or two players) or a full tournament, with three rounds of variable length. There is no joystick-waggling in the control system, with a variety of kicks, throws and punches on offer using simple joystick motions. Once the players are close together they grapple - this gives you a chance to lift and then piledrive your opponent.</desc>

		<name>Amiga Encounter</name>
		<desc>Amiga Encounter is a Shooter game, developed and published by Novagen, which was released in 1991.

Blimey, this takes me back a bit! One ot the first games I ever had on my trusty but now deceased C64. Encounter was also the first game to appear from the Howard Hughes of the programming world.

Encounter is basically an extension of the age-old Battlezone scenario, and when it was originally released, was praised for its (then) stunning fast filled graphics - and the lack of glitch associated with the genre. Unfortunately, what you considered hot and stunning in the old days now looks decidedly dated.

The basic idea of the game is to patrol an oddly-coloured desert and take out the enemy space-ships and missiles before they get to you. However, punctuating the barren landscape are a series of metallic columns, and these can be used to deflect shots and to hide behind. And thatâ€™s it.

Although this may sound a little damning, thereâ€™s no doubt that Encounter is a playable little blast. The graphics, whilst not pushing back any barriers, are smoothly updated and the enemy ships are fast and deadly. The trouble is that there just isnâ€™t enough to do, and when you consider that Novagen are asking twenty-odd quid for it, I donâ€™t think that pure nostalgia offers enough for your money.</desc>

		<desc>Amiga Karate (Karate/ST Karate) is a 2D one-on-one fighting game similar to World Karate Championship. The player controls a karate fighter through different stages that become more difficult over time. Fights take place against a single opponent and the health bars of the two are shown near the top of the screen. The character starts with three lives and additional ones can be gained by reaching certain scores.

When holding a button or key pressed the controls include moving backwards and forwards, jump, duck, high punch and mid punch, front somersault and block. When that button or key is released the controls offer turning, high kick, mid kick, low kick, high back kick, jump kick, foot kick and back somersault. Fights are fast-paced and require a lot of hit and run tactics.</desc>

There are two ways to successfully complete the level - destroy enough of the infection to allow the planet to survive, or rescue enough of the citizens, Defender-style. For each of the organs to be destroyed, a specific weapon can be created to cleanse it easier - blueprints must be collected and taken back to your ship for this.</desc>

		<desc>After naval combat, the second sequel to The Ancient Art of War is all about aircraft combat in World War I. It is a real-time strategy game in nature, and most of the time is spent on the overhead map. Here players plan their strategy and set the goals and routes for their aircraft. There are various statistics which are affected by the happenings on the battle field, e.g. destroying factories lengthen the time the enemy can get new aircraft. Overall the game features many real and fictional campaigns, as well as an editor to create more, with the winning condition to either destroy the enemy's flight force, his capital city or wearing him out.

When a flight battle or bombing occurs, the game switches to a side-scrolling combat screen. Here players actively participate in the combat; during dog fights the goal is to destroy the enemy and bombings are a matter of releasing the bomb at the right time while avoiding flak fire. Those sequences can be automatically calculated by the computer; then the pilot's skills affect his changes of success.</desc>

The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself in a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.

Originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST and later released for the Apple IIGS and DOS platforms, the game was widely ported to other contemporary systems. Later efforts resulted in several game engine recreations for the game that permitted it to run on modern computers, consoles and mobile phones. In 2006, Chahi independently released a 15th Anniversary Edition for Windows which allowed the game to be played on modern computers with original or enhanced visuals; following up in 2011 for its 20th anniversary, ports of the game were prepared for iOS and Android based devices.

Another World was highly innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which granted the game praise amongst critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers.

Another World is a platform game, featuring a control scheme wherin the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation specific actions such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, Lester is unarmed, as he is able to kick at small creatures but is otherwise defenseless.

Later in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.[3] Eventually, Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes (not featured in the original Amiga release). Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.

Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard.[4] However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. The game provides no clues as to what to do next, features no HUD (with an exception of oxygen bar during the swimming sequences) and no on-screen text, and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien</desc>

		<desc>Antago is a puzzle game played on a 5x5 square board. It can be played either against the computer, with a choice of up to 10 levels of difficulty, or against another human player. Other options allow you to play a match or start a training session, as well as select between "plain" (empty board) and "prepared" (pre-arranged balls on the board) game modes. A demo mode is also available, where the computer plays against itself.

An angel and a devil compete against each other, with the goal of aligning five "balls" in a row on the board, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They are moved around the board with the joystick, pushing each other as their paths cross, and strategically placing balls on the edge of the board to both disrupt their opponent's lines and try to create a line of 5 of their own balls.

Each level features different background and board graphics. There is no background music playing during the game, and only basic sound effects when the two characters push each other, place a ball on the board and win.</desc>

Gameplay scrolls sideways and is platform based, with a very cutesy and consolesque look, and 17 levels, each containing an extra hidden section. Each level has its own elemental setting, taking in the fires of Hell and the clouds and light of Heaven. The levels are full of boxes, which can be used as weapons by kicking them at enemies.

As you go you can also collect money, which can be spent in shops to buy useful extras. Many collectibles and other items exist, such as leaves (which change the effects of gravity, allowing you to jump higher and stay hanging in the air for longer), extra lives, fruit for bonus points, and balloons allowing a degree of vertical movement.</desc>

		<desc>Approach Trainer is based on A320 Airbus (Edition USA), but focuses on starting and landing the plane. This version uses the flight model of its predecessors and attempts to simulate reality as close as possible. The player can customize the flying attempts by setting a variety of options: day or night, short or long descent, weather and of course which of the 58 airports to use. Improvements in comparison to A320 Airbus (Edition USA) include optional controls with an analog joystick, improvements in graphics and flight model (e.g. the navigational tools) and a competitive two-player mode.</desc>

		<desc>The Aquatic Games was conceived partly as an Olympics tie-in, and partly as a stop-gap for James Pond fans (the third platform title in the series (Operation Starfish) was in the process of being heavily delayed, eventually being released in 1994). This game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics.



The events take the form of various mini-games, usually in the same vein as Hyper Sports, but with an aquatic theme and the humour seen in the James Pond series (e.g. The 100 Metre Splash). More unusual mini-games include Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals, and Gymnastics. Events can be played with up to 4 players.</desc>

Unfortunately, the nuclear war was just the beginning. An alien race, the Spurcians, made advantage from this situation. So they've conquered Earth and have taken those eight cities. Now the only survivors are inside the freight vessel Genesite, which is in orbit. On a last attempt to free the underwater colonies, the pilot Josh Aldrin (you) is send back. Meanwhile, the Spurcians destroyed the freight vessel, making you the last human on Earth. So, you are now on revenge...

Your job is now to flight with your craft above the water surface. Destroying enemy alien crafts and energy generators. When you destroyed enough generators, the energy shield from the main pyramid fails, and you can attack the level guardian. Once he is destroyed, you use the tunnel, which connects the underwater colonies, to get to the next one. You will play all eight colonies. While in the tunnel, you have the chance to collect power-ups to regenerate your ships energy (health). Inside a level, you have to live with the energy you currently have. Oh, and by the way, you have, like in reality, only a single life.</desc>

There are nine levels in the game. In several levels, there are various gameplay elements which include flying on the magic carpet and racing against your opponent in a mine cart. You will also meet some characters, which if you give them an item they want, they will give you something in return.
 
In other levels, you have to do things yourself. For example, obtain a snake that will set a prisoner free, or using a blow torch to open some frozen doors.

Arabian Nights comes on two floppy disks, but a CD32 version is also available on 1 CD.</desc>

		<name>Arcade Trivia Quiz</name>
		<desc>Arcade Trivia Quiz is a quiz game for 1, 2 or 3 players.

There are four blocks of questions. Each block contains questions in six categories;

Art &amp; Literature, Science, Music, Film and Television, Sport, History &amp; Geography.

Icons representing these categories are displayed in a pyramid arrangement. The icons of available questions flash in sequence and the players must press FIRE at the correct time to select the icon of their choice. All questions are multiple choice with four answers, one correct &amp; three incorrect, being available.
Both question selection and answering are timed and must be completed in eight seconds.

Scoring is cash based. All players start with Â£1.00 and each player stakes 20p per attempt. If, by answering questions successfully, a player makes it to the top of the pyramid then they trigger a 'Cash Run' feature which can earn extra money - up to Â£5.00.</desc>

		<name>Archon : The Light and the Dark</name>
		<desc>Archon is a turn-based strategy video game. It is based on the principle of chess, with the addition of combat phases. Each piece is placed on the chessboard according to its range of movement and forms an army representing light or shadow. When one unit attempts to take another, both are transported to a combat arena to determine the winner. A unit can remain wounded even after winning its duel, which reduces its chances of victory in a future battle.  The game is won when all opposing units are destroyed or when a player has five power points.</desc>

		<name>Archon II : Adept</name>
		<desc>The sequel to Archon, Archon II: Adept features a more complex board and enhanced gameplay.

Each side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard with the ability to cast spells against other Adepts and his summonings - and must defeat the other side, either Chaos or Order, by attacking him/her with summoned Elementals or Demons. Each side can summon 4 unique elementals at a time or choose from 4 demons, common to both.

Gameplay is similar to the original, reminiscent of a chess-like board game, requiring strategy, but with arcade elements, especially when two adepts confront each other face-to-face. The board also shifts from time to time, making the strategy less predictable.</desc>

Unlike other games of the genre, humor is not getting short, as a referee is constantly pestering at you, making sarcastic comments if you fail to reach very good results. Most events are visually presented on several screens which are flipped (not scrolled).</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<name>Armada</name>
		<desc>In 1588 Spain was the World's superpower. With massive wealth brought across the Atlantic from the Caribbean, and an army that was widely regarded as the toughest and most efficient in Europe, few could stand in its way. It was certainly the only power that would consider an amphibious attack on a well populated and modern country, England, over 1,000 miles from a home port.

As in Waterloo, also programmed by this team, you can play the war from both points of view. If you choose to play the English you take the role of Lord Howard, the Spanish commander is Medina Sidonia. You have control over the whole fleet and it is up to you to secure victory for your country; the English also have control over the coastal stations. There is no sound whatsoever in the game - a nice nautical tune would have enhanced the often lengthy wait between goes.

Compared to the previous Arc wargames, Armada is more a new scenario than a new game. Then again, it is a hard task modifying an already successful game system. Definitely release of the month for people who have experienced and enjoyed its predecessor.</desc>

The game is controlled by a point and click interface where you can check messages, deploy satellites and troops, send food to the regions which need it, and spy on nations. You will regularly get messages that a country is deploying forces or increasing its diplomatic presence in another nation, and can show support or criticism for these. Be aware that these decisions have consequences - the 16 nations all have feelings of importance and would not want to be sidelined.</desc>

		<name>Armalyte : The Final Run</name>
		<desc>Armalyte: The Final Run, like its C64 namesake, is a traditional side-scrolling shoot'em up heavily inspired by R-Type, giving the player's spaceship the task of traversing five levels. The starting setup is a simple forward-facing shot as well as a power shot that must be charged by holding on to the fire button. Upgrades are a forward-facing three-way, a vertical two-way, or the addition of a single backwards shot (only one of the three at time). Also available are pods that attach to the ship and fire a forwards laser, and, only in the final level, self-homing missiles.

The levels not only feature many enemy formations, but also environmental hazards, like drops of acid or falling stalactites. On one occasion, the scrolling speeds up, making the level a hazard course. Each stage ends with the customary end boss.</desc>

		<name>Army Moves</name>
		<desc>Your careers officer in school really had a hard time finding you a job. Just saying 'I wanna be an 'ard man!' wasn't exactly helpful. Still, now you're in the Special Operations Corps (SOC), you've been sent on a well dangerous mission to steal information from the enemy. You must fight your way over a bridge in your jeep, through air defences in your helicopter and finally, on foot into the headquarters themselves proclaiming yourself a hero! OK, OK and a 'well 'ard geezer' if that's what you want...

The level of gameplay in Army Moves is so minimal that it annoys me to think that people may have paid out big bucks just so that they can practise holding down the fire button and religiously going through two joystick movement patterns. The slightest deviation from the stringent stick manoeuvring results in instant death, and return a trip to the start of the level! So if, after ten minutes' play, you haven't vengefully put the disk under the grill and watched it bubble its way into oblivion, you'll be slumped over your joystick dreaming of happier times. I regret the loss to the world's natural resources caused by the production of this utterly awful 'game'.</desc>

		<name>Arnhem : The 'Market Garden' Operation</name>
		<desc>Arnhem: The 'Market Garden' Operation is a Strategy game, developed and published by CCS, which was released in 1991.



Arnhem is a first entry in R. T. Smith's World War II trilogy, including Desert Rats and Vulcan. It simulates the assault operation initiated by Allied forces in September 1944 to take over the bridge of Arnhem, the Netherlands. There are British, Irish, Welsh, Polish, and American units of Allied forces against German forces and 5 scenarios, including advance to Eindhoven, operation 'Garden', operation 'Market', the bridge too far, and entire campaign from start to finish.



The gameplay is shown on scrolling map in turns. The player of Allied forces places airborne units all over the map on clear places and waits while they are landing. After that the player selects the units and gives them orders to travel, dig in, or change size. Units move on the grid of rectangular cells. The bombard attack is possible for certain units. Axis forces defend from the attacks. Historically, Axis won this battle, and it is player's opportunity to alter the history.



The game comes with detailed instruction booklet and includes historical notes on the campaign, maps and photographs. Two players representing Allied and Axis may be computer or human.</desc>

		<name>Arnie 2</name>
		<desc>Arnie 2 is an isometric action game. Although it's obvious to which Hollywood actor the game's name alludes, Arnie 2 is not a licensed title and not based on any movie.

It is the sequel to the Amiga / C64 platform game Arnie (1992). Unlike the previous title it has been developed in-house by Zeppelin

Fast reflexes and a lust for violence are required for success here. Your average muscleman shoots and bombs his way through four enemy-infested territories: Shut down a chemical plant by blowing up enough pipeline valves. Clear an airfield from enemy soldiers, tanks and helicopters. Climb from battleship to battleship in a hostile harbor. And finally, rescue as many prisoners as possible from a jungle POW camp.

Naturally, the levels are crawling with enemies: from simple infantry armed with rifles, mortars or rocket launchers to MG teams, missile batteries and tanks. Most of the opponents are stationary and stolidly fire in a single direction; however, foxholes spew out cannon-fodder at a constant rate. To destroy such nests or efficiently dispatch groups of soldiers, Arnie has a (limited) supply of grenades. Some deceased foes drop more powerful weapons as well as invaluable first aid kits and extra lives.</desc>

		<name>Arthur : The Quest for Excalibur</name>
		<desc>Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur is an illustrated interactive fiction computer game written by Bob Bates and published by Infocom in 1989. Typically for an Infocom title, it was released for many popular computer platforms of the time, such as the Macintosh, PC, and the Apple II series. Quite atypically for an Infocom product, it featured illustrations of locations, characters and objects within the game. It is Infocom's thirty-fourth game and is the second of two Infocom games developed by Challenge, Inc. using Infocom's development tools.

The player assumes the role of a young Arthur, before the legendary days of Camelot. The "sword in the stone" that would signify Arthur's destiny to rule, has been stolen by the evil King Lot. In the quest to regain the sword, the player must prove to Merlin that he has the qualities needed to be a great king: chivalry, experience, and wisdom. Merlin assists Arthur by giving him periodic advice as well as the power to transform into animals, but also tells Arthur that unless Excalibur is recovered within three days, Lot will usurp his destiny as a king of legendary stature.</desc>

Many squares featuring a variety of power-up type effects, such as improved weaponry, extra lives, a level warp, a device to stop the landscape's (otherwise constant) scrolling (thereby giving you a chance to 'pick off' the aliens more carefully), and one which speeds up the aliens (avoid this!). You can move backwards a short way, but it takes a few squares' worth of screen to get fully across the screen, so bear this in mind in the mazier sections.</desc>

Much like the similar looking USSR at the time, the society is crumbling, and you are an upstart aiming to take over power for yourself â€¦.. erm, I mean, aiming to bring peace, harmony, prosperity and happiness. 

You start off in a small coastal province, and must progress by meeting people and negotiating to get them on your side â€“ sometimes the sword is mightier than the pen, sometimes not. You must ensure that the more militant locals are pacified, and that ethnic minorities are looked after.

While those sections are all strategic, there are also some vector-based combat sections. These ensure that brawns are required along with brains, and give the game some variety.</desc>

		<desc>Astate is a French point-and-click adventure game with static screens and a icon-based interface. Devoid of inventory (you can carry one item at time), it visually recalls Myst. As an archaeologist the player has to search the French countryside and its Templar ruins for all the pieces of a missing statue. Each piece collected plays a short animation with part of the storyline. Clicking the right mouse button cycles through several icons, each with a specific function:

â–  A pair of boots allows travelling from one place to the other by clicking them on the right or the left side of the screen;

â–  A pick-axe and an electric drill for prospecting spots on the screen;

â–  A scanner helps finding the right spot to dig for an object;

â–  A hand picks up objects;

â–  A garbage pail gets rid of a held object .

There's several ways to die on this game, some (like walking on a dangerous spot) are instantaneous. On some occasions, the player is presented with a screen where he has to avoid falling spiders. It is also possible to get into an unwinnable situation, by getting rid of a necessary object.</desc>

You see all the atoms available for you to move in a top-down view. Down below on the left side is a small preview of what you must get. That picture represents a molecular structure that you must recreate by moving atoms horizontally and/or vertically. Once you move an atom, it won't stop unless it hits an obstacle, like a wall, or another atom, therefore you must use walls and other atoms creatively.

The game contains 30 levels, and you have a limited time for each level.</desc>

Now it is up to the player to organize and manage the "Aufschwung Ost" (German for "Upturn East" in reference to Eastern Germany, the former GDR) in this political business sim. Gameplay takes place on two scales: A large scale (East Germany) for power plants, highways and other infrastructure and a smaller, SimCity-like city-scale for specific buildings. Besides the historic "East Germany - 1989" scenario there six more, each with different problems (high pollution, national debt,...). None of them has a "goal" though so the game goes on forever (unless you decide to resign or you're kicked out of office due to bad work).</desc>

		<desc>Austerlitz is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Personal Software Services and published by Mirrorsoft. It was released in the United Kingdom and Germany for the Amiga, Atari ST and DOS home computers in 1989. It was also re-released in France for Amiga home computers by Mirror Image in 1991.

Third entry in a row of historic wargames focusing on the Napoleonic era (the first two were Waterloo and Borodino). This time the player can re-fight the decisive battle of Austerlitz, which took place on Dec 2, 1805. You may either play as Emperor Napoleon or Czar Alexander. It is also possible to play a two player game, or to take neither side (watching the computer playing both sides).

Compared to the first two entries in the series the games' presentation and interface didn't change. You are observing the battle area through a 3-D perspective, while issuing commands by typing in certain pre-defined text elements (combined with names of commanders, places and time of execution). You will get reports from your subordinates indicating whether or not your orders have been carried out completely (this is of course besides watching the battlefield yourself).</desc>

		<name>Australopiticus Mechanicus</name>
		<desc>Australo Piticus Mechanicus is a platform game exclusively published on the Amiga. The player has to guide the protagonist named Androids van Laptop on his journey to rescue his lost maiden.

The game itself flips screens, no scrolling is involved. In melee combat you can hit with your sword (if you have one), or throw stones if you want to stay at distance. Weapons can be purchased at shops, which are placed frequently on the platforms. During your way, you collect money and gems to stock up for better weapons. You can jump, take objects (especially keys), use objects, and often ladders have to be climbed. The game character has two attributes: hit points, representing the health, and strength, which defines how much damage the player's character is doing to enemies and is defined by the equipment and weapon the character is carrying.

There are eight levels. Beside the platform game, there is a futuristic gag: directly after loading the game you can decide not to enter the game, but the "system". The system is a text-based Unix-like console, in which by typing commands a Space Invaders game and some pictures of the developers can be found.</desc>

		<desc>Autoduel is a hybrid game based on Steve Jackson Games board game Car Wars. It incorporates elements of role-playing, driving and action-based combat. The game is set in a futuristic version of USA, where gangs and vigilantes rule the wilderness, and people's only protection are armored cars with mounted weaponry. The player is cast in the role of an average person who must at first earn enough money to buy an own car, and then perform courier missions throughout the country.

The game's progression is fairly open-ended: the player is free to visit different cities, explore highways, participate in car Arena battles to earn money, take on gangsters in the wilderness, salvage car parts, etc. A few courier missions must be completed in order to advance the story. The player can construct and customize vehicles using guns, mine-layers, smokescreens, oil slicks, rockets and other accessories, choosing between various body and chassis types for the car. The entire game is viewed from a top-down perspective.</desc>

The character only fights with projectiles that he finds on his way. The player must therefore always be careful to take objects with him when he moves so that he does not run out of ammunition. Weapons include empty wine bottles, paint cans, and rubbish bags. Some of these objects have special abilities that can be useful throughout the game. Moktar is a rather difficult game because the enemies are numerous and the traps difficult to overcome. 
The graphics are quite detailed and colourful and the character animation is quite fluid.</desc>
