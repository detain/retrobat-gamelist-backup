		<name>Ace Combat : Joint Assault</name>
		<desc>Ace Combat is the perfect game to have while on the move. Think about it ? when you're a kid, you run around holding your arms out pretending to be a fighter plane, right? Or was that just us? Either way, having an airborne action game of this pedigree on the PSP is never unwelcome, and Joint Assault marks the first time the series has hit the handheld since Ace Combat X in 2006.

So what's changed? Well, certainly not the midair firefights and frenzied atmosphere ? although the visuals have been overhauled and the combat system completely redesigned to provide a closer, more visceral flight experience. While some plane games focus on simulation, Ace Combat focuses on accessibility and fun, without losing authenticity.

You get to jet over plenty of real-world locations including Tokyo, London, San Francisco and more, as you take on missions to smash enemy fighter pilots out of the sky. Tactical dogfighting is the name of the game here, and the 'Enhanced Combat View' takes advantage of the huge aerial environments to provide an exhilarating atmosphere as you deliver that ace shot at high speed.

When you're done with the single-player missions, get online for some multiplayer gameplay, which allows for up to eight players in an online versus scenario, or four pals in a co-op campaign.</desc>

In Campaign Mode, you play as a pilot in the Gryphus Squadron of the Federal Republic of Aurelia. Defending the invaded country, your mission will take you to the battle-filled skies in order to take down the enemy and restore freedom and peace to their homeland. Campaign mode makes use of the Strategic AI System, where the contents of a mission change based on the strategies that you select. The game also has a multiplayer mode for up to four players. In addition to a last-man standing dog fight mode, you'll be able to split into teams for cooperative combat.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Alien Syndrome (USA).iso</path>
		<name>Alien Syndrome</name>
		<desc>Alien Syndrome is a top down shooter inspired by Sega's original Alien Syndrome action game. The games story takes place thousands of years in the future; by this point in time mankind has explored many parts of the galaxy and established numerous colonies. One such colony, Seti-Alpha 5 (SAT5), has ceased communications for some reason and it is your job to head to SAT5 and investigate what went wrong. Upon arrival, you encounter the alien syndrome, a force which can mutate man and machine into deadly aliens. These events take place roughly 100 years after those in the original Alien Syndrome game.

When you begin the game you can select one of several characters as well as choose a character specialty (such as demolitions expert, firebug,  seal, tank, and sharpshooter). The specialty you select will determine your initial character stats; as you play through the game you earn levels which provide you points to allocate towards improving your stats. The character stats help determine your characters accuracy in ranged  or close attacks, speed, healing power, resistance to fire/radiation, armor strength, and so on.

Similar to the original game, the action is viewed top down. You'll need to explore the numerous corridors and rooms found on SAT5 and eliminate the numerous alien invaders found there. Mission objectives are often provided to you which need to be completed. Additional weapons, ammo, and other useful items can be found throughout the levels. Your character has a limited amount of energy, and if all energy is lost then you will need to begin again at the last checkpoint crossed.</desc>

Each 'class' is actually a mini-game. Your goal is to complete as many mini-games as possible from the 9x9 grid, and score as many lines as you can (sort of like Noughts and Crosses). Mini-games range from mind-bending quizzes to wacky sports games, to the just plain silly, like protecting a roast banana from oncoming apes, or flying through the sky delivering parachutes to plummeting primates.</desc>

		<desc>In Archer Maclean's Mercury, your job is to guide a blob of mercury, or several blobs, along various mazes, by tilting the game world.  En route, you are required to run over color markers, which will change the color of your blob to the color required to win the level. Some areas of the game will require you to split your mercury into two, roll each blob over two different colored switches, and then combine the two blobs to form a third, different color.

Each level has different elements to it, some of which will help you and some of which will hinder you.  There are conveyor belts, moving platforms, launch pads, and jagged corners that when hit, will cause your blob to split into two, even three.

There are 83 different mazes, each one progressively harder than the last.</desc>

		<desc>ATV Offroad Fury Pro is an offroad racing game which was released alongside with ATV Offroad Fury 4. Besides the expected ATV (all-terrain vehicles) there are also a variety of other vehicles to race with, e.g. trucks or bikes, which is the foundation of the career mode: participating in a string of championships which are divided in vehicle type and difficulty. Upgrades and additional vehicles are purchased with credits which can be earned in a number of ways: besides price money for winning races, credits are also awarded for performing stunts. There are also three sponsors which offer free upgrades and/or credits for fulfilling their demands regarding performance and stunt rating, but they should be hired with caution because a big penalty is assigned for missed goals. The available types of races are Supercross, Rallycross, National, Freestyle, Circuit, Endurcross, Rally and Snowcross.

Besides a basic course editor and multiplayer for up to four players (which is also the maximum number of racers in single-player) there are also connectivity features with ATV Offroad Fury 4 which allow to exchange courses/vehicles and access a shared online community.</desc>

In deference to the global popularity of B-Boying, the game takes place at global locations from Japan to Europe to New York. There are 21 venues in total. In the B-Boy Life mode, you have to gather a crew and battle against superstars. You can also create your own character and define the moves.</desc>

		<name>Burnout Dominator</name>
		<desc>Burnout Dominator is an installment of the Burnout series for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable systems. The game is mainly focused on returned Burnouts feature - draining a complete boost meter without stopping wich was last seen in Burnout 2: Point of Impact. With return of Burnouts feature there were four new game modes added including Maniac Mode (players need to drive dangerously to get highest scores by earning drifts, air, oncoming and near misses. Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses), Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score).
However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn't feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer. But PSP version features Burnout HQ where you can upload you score and download new track. 
The game consists of 12 different tracks, in 8 different real world locations. Each track has a forward and a reverse configuration.</desc>

		<desc>First installation of the Burnout-series on handheld consoles combines the best features of the first three games: Burnout, Burnout 2: Point of Impact, and Burnout 3: Takedown.  Aggressive racing is still the centerpiece attraction of Burnout Legends and the player's task is not only to win the races but also crash opponent cars as much as possible.  Opponent takedowns, drifts, and other stunts award Burnout Points which in turn unlock new cars and other awards.

One player games can be played as single events or as a World Tour where the player needs to compete in different races and succeed in them in order to advance through five car classes (Compact, Muscle, Coupe, Sport, and Super).  In addition there is the Crash mode, where the goal is to create as much wreckage as possible by ploughing the player car into the traffic.  The different race types include Race, Time Attack, Road Rage, Pursuit, Face Off, Eliminator, Burning Lap, and Grand Prix.  Multiplayer game modes include Race, Road Rage, Pursuit, special Crash modes Double Impact and Party Crash (all these can can be played as single events or as a tournament), and Collector Challenge where the player has the opportunity to win other player's Collector cars.

PSP version game sharing feature allows others to play multiplayer events or single player demo without their own Burnout Legends UMD.

DS version Multi-Pak support allows two player games without additional game cards.  More than two player games require multiple game cards.</desc>

		<name>Chili Con Carnage</name>
		<desc>Chili Con Carnage is a semi-sequel to the PS2 game Total Overdose - the Latin-style action game by the same developer. The game recycles a lot of the levels and assets from the PS2 version, but it has new missions and a structure fine-tuned for handheld play. While the original game is a free-roaming GTA clone, the PSP version consists of a series of short missions. It focuses on the shooting sequences of Total Overdose where Ramiro uses his flashiest moves to dispatch mobs and fiends.

The main story mode, El Gringo Loco is identical to Total Overdose. The player takes on the role of Ramiro Cruz, a young man who has just witnessed his dad's murder in classic Mexican fashion «combine harvester through office wall», and now he is on a gun-fueled quest for vengeance through Mexico. The second single player mode El Macho is a collection of different mini challenges which do not tell any story but give access to different characters with different gameplay. The game also future two dynamic multiplayer modes: Hangman for up to 4 players on 1 console and Fiesta for Wi-Fi gameplay.

There is a massive amount of exotic weapons and the gameplay is over the top, with bullet-time and gravity-defying moves.</desc>

		<name>Class of Heroes</name>
		<desc>Class of Heroes is an enhanced remake of Wizardry Xth: Unlimited Students.

With the surprising apparition of the labyrinths, the whole world was changed. Many adventurers delved into these mazes, hunting for riches, and it wasn't long till the children started following their dreams of becoming heroes. To aid these children, the Adventurer Academies were founded, to prepare them in their perilous journeys.

Players start out at the Particus Academy, the newest of the academies, where they'll be able to assemble their party from students, each hailing from one of the 10 available races, 15 professions and 3 alignments. Each race has a different attitude toward the others, keeping the party compatibility system already featured in the previous games. The academy serves as a home base, where students can modify their team, purchase/sell equipment, practice alchemy, heal/revive injured party-members and take on new quests.

The labyrinths have an overall similar layout, but a few sections are randomly generated upon entrance, so are the enemy and item locations. Battles are turn-based, with a tension gauge slowly filling, allowing the party to unleash Gambits upon their foes. If the whole party is defeated in one of the labyrinths, as a last resort, a rescue team can be sent after them. The longer the rescue team takes to find them, the higher the chance that certain items will be lost, or even party members could die permanently.</desc>

		<name>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</name>
		<desc>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is based on the 2009 computer-animated film of the same name. The player is cast as Flint Lockwood, an aspiring inventor who tries to solve the hunger problem in his town by creating a machine that turns water into food. Soon, the machine is out of control, and it literally is raining food on Flint's town. It's up to him to stop the machine and get rid of the abundance of food. To make matters worse however, the machine is now protected by mutated food.

The player has to fight and puzzle their way through twenty levels, using Flint's self created gadgets such as a hair dryer converted into a heat gun, which can be used to melt obstacles composed of ice cream, or a mechanical boxing glove to punch food. Each level features thirty specific destroyable food items. Destroying all of them unlocks a piece of a blueprint for a special item.</desc>

		<desc>Code Lyoko: Quest for Infinity is the second game based off of the popular French animated TV series Code Lyoko and it is presented as a 3D action platformer. It continues the original premise of the four high school students who discover a computer in an abandoned factory, holding a large virtual world plagued by the virus X.A.N.A., but many of the characters' backgrounds are taken from later seasons in the series.

Players take the role of one of the four heroes from the show, Ulrich, Odd, Yumi or Aelita, and fight across the virtual environment of Lyoko and the internet against the dangerous virus X.A.N.A. and his army of monsters. Levels are accessed from a main hub and players can switch between any of the characters at any time, but they share health and energy. The characters' various weapons and abilities can be used to take them out, like Ulrich's swords, Odd's laser arrows or the ability to climb walls, or Yumi being the only one who can balance on thin ledges. Many of these skills are unlocked during the course of the game. X.A.N.A. on the Internet can be hunted down using the digital submarine Skidbladnir.</desc>

The story has Crash's arch-nemeses, Neo and Nina Cortex, creating a device that turns the creatures on Crash's island into monsters, threatening to bring an end to existence on the peaceful island.

The gameplay has the player explore levels, picking up power-ups to use against enemies as well as for the first time, use fighting combos such as punches and kicks against enemies.  Players can also "hijack" 15 different enemy monsters to use against the others, each with their own special abilities and powers like fire breathing and earthquakes.  Players can also interact with their world, climbing trees and swinging from ropes and even surf and skate throughout the levels.  There is also co-op abilities where a friend can pop into the game at any point.

The games across are almost identical, excluding controls (the Wii utilizes the Wii-remote) and graphics are different depending on the systems graphics capabilities.</desc>

		<desc>Killian von Rohcoff's life has started out bad, and is about to get worse. He shakes off a hangover to get to his graduation only to find out he's finished second to his hated rival. Then when he finally gets a lead on a job, it ends up getting him robbed and nearly killed...and that's just the beginning. Soon Killian and his new "acquaintances" will end up getting caught up in much larger events that revolve around an ancient artifact called the Wicked Stone.

Crimson Gem Saga is a turn-based RPG, with over world travel being done on an isometric plane. The game has some minor action elements sprinkled into the turn-based gameplay, like critical combo chains and an ambush system. Characters level up individually, but all draw from a group pool of skill points in order to unlock and gain new skill abilities, some of which are combination attacks. In essence, the core gameplay is very similar to a JRPG, despite the fact that the game's developed by a Korean company.</desc>

		<desc>Danny is troubled with insomnia.  Desperate for sleep and unable to get it, he finds himself a test subject in the mad Dr. Reubens' crowning achievement, C.R.U.S.H. (or Cognitive Regression Utilizing pSychiatric Heuristics, if you prefer).  C.R.U.S.H. puts the subject under hypnosis and allows them to explore their psyche and confront their own deep, dark secrets.

Crush is a platforming game with puzzle elements.  Initially, it looks like a third person platformer, but you'll soon discover the game's hook - as Danny, you can "crush" the landscape based on the camera direction, giving you a new perspective on a previously impassable situation.  Huge gaps become mere footsteps wide, or may even disappear.  Tall buildings can be squashed flat, allowing you to walk over previously impossible terrain.  By rotating the camera with the D-Pad, you can choose to crush the level sideways, similar to a 2D platformer like Super Mario Bros., or top-down, somewhat like Bomberman.

However, there are, of course, restrictions.  Not all blocks can be crossed when crushed.  In addition to this, some blocks that you can stand on in 3D simply don't exist in 2D.  And then there's creatures lurking based on Danny's fears: giant cockroaches roam around some levels, and need to be squashed before Danny can get past them.  Some blocks contain nightmarish limbs that swipe at Danny when he gets too close.  And some blocks (representing Danny's childhood fear of building blocks) even come to life and patrol the 3D levels.</desc>

Finally able to explore past the secure boundaries of Haven City, Daxter inadvertently takes on a job as a pest exterminator, a task the Old Sage intuitively knew he was proficient at since the first Jak and Daxter. Armed with a fly swatter and soon afterwards a spray canister that allows him to not only stun bugs but to hover in the air, Daxter unravels to the player the introduction of the upcoming invasion that occurred in Jak II into Haven City. The invasion is led by the Metal Heads who are using bug-like variations called Metal Bugs to permeate the city. Later upgrades include a flame thrower attachment as well as a detonator weapon.

Daxter's path towards freeing Jak involves a series of platforming and combat challenges through a wide variety of environments ranging from a high speed transit system to a fish cannery, and all the way to the Krimson Guard fortress where Daxter has to sneak past the guards to eventually save Jak.

Daxter features a variety of vehicle levels, minigames typical of the Jak series, as well as a series of dream level sequences that take Daxter into a realm where he is the hero. The dream minigames spoof cinematic moments from The Matrix, Indiana Jones, Braveheart and Lord of the Rings. Wi-fi multiplayer mode of Bug combat is included, where players can use their trained collected bugs to fight each other.</desc>

		<desc>Take on the role of the Grim Reapers teenage son Death Jr. after he unleashes an unspeakable horror from a box that Pandora herself couldn't open in a school field trip at the museum.

Death Jr. is a 3-D platform game in which you control Death Jr. a.k.a. DJ in an attempt to find his friends that have been taken by the evil necromancer Moloch. DJ's friend souls appear as puzzle pieces throughout the game in which you must find to bring them back.

Use DJ's scythe to not only maim and kill but to reach heights not accessible by jumping. Upgrade weapons and learn new moves (scythe combos) by collecting widgets scattered throughout the levels. The ability to destroy the environment is an advantage to DJ as the more successful hits with his scythe be it animate or inanimate his combo meter will rise allowing DJ's friend Pandora to assist in the fight.

Death Jr.'s camera is a free roaming camera that follows DJ around with the ability to snap to the position DJ is looking at the press of a button. You can also free look with the press of a button and lock on to enemies and strafe while shooting with a gun. At the end of each level you receive a report card that tells you your number of kills, how much destruction you caused, the total number of combo points, special items discovered and your final grade.</desc>

		<name>Disgaea : Afternoon of Darkness</name>
		<desc>Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed.
Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.</desc>

		<name>Downstream Panic!</name>
		<desc>Downstream Panic! is a colourful puzzle game that can mixes elements from Locoroco with Worms.

A massive cyclone has sucked all of the fish out of the oceans! The player must safely guide them back. Levels start at the top of the area where the fish are contained in a blob of water. They need to reach the ocean safely at the bottom of the screen with guidance of the player.

Using a variety of creative tools like fans, onions, rockets, and cloud factories, the fish can be guided through platforms, past hungry sharks, piranhas and many other dangers. The tools can also be used to control the flow of the water and the direction the fish travel. Plants will stop the flow and by blowing flowers bridges are opened. At the start of the level, the area usually needs to be scanned first using the free camera perspective to discover all the hazards. Certain fish can be sacrificed, but a sufficient number of them needs to reach the ocean.

The regular mode eventually unlocks the Free Play and Survival modes. In Free Play the player can spend the money from regular games to buy tools for the stages. In survival all levels are replayed in succession, but lost fish are not regained in the next level.</desc>

Next is the Z trial mode, which consists of two different types of play: survival, where you fight against CPU-controlled opponents for as long as you can, and time attack, where you see how fast you can make it through a predetermined set of opponents.

Finally, there?s the Profile Card mode in which the players will have their in-game character profile cards that lists their name and power level. The player can design their own card and customize them with the items from the game's item store.</desc>

Since Shrek's not a big fan of this idea, he and his friends journey to the Worcestershire academy to recruit Fiona's cousin, Artie, for the job. Unfortunately, while he's away the dastardly Prince Charming has big plans to take over the kingdom.

SHReK the THiRD is an action-platformer with a heavy emphasis on brawling and humor. With plenty of Prince Charming's goons in his path (including black knights, evil gnomes, a crooning Captain Hook, and giant walking trees), Shrek will have to use all of his abilities to defeat them, find his way home, and pick up some souvenir mugs along the way.

Each level features several quests, lots of collectibles, and funny situations. While most of the levels feature Shrek himself, there are six playable characters in total (Donkey, Puss in Boots, Fiona, Artie, and Sleeping Beauty feature as well), over 20 levels, three big boss battles, and several multiplayer minigames.</desc>

		<desc>In Eragon, based on the movie of the same name, which is in turn based on the book Eragon, by Christopher Paolini, the player controls Saphira, Eragon's dragon companion and friend, and her task is to help him along 9 different levels in which you will be killing enemies, protecting allies, racing through narrow corridors and clearing pathways. Saphira can attack, brake, reverse course and use boost to cross long distances. The main means of attack are her talons, used to grab enemies or larger objects to bomb everything on the ground below. There is also a selection of offensive and defensive spells. Health is replenished by eating livestock.

There are 6 arena levels unlocked by playing through the singleplayer campaign. These are multiplayer stages where you can fight versus as many as three bots or human players in 12 different game modes. The PSP version is completely different game than those for the other platforms, focusing only on Saphira the dragon while the others prominently feature the hero Eragon.</desc>

		<name>Every Extend Extra</name>
		<desc>Every Extend Extra is a remake of the popular freeware game Every Extend and in all main aspects of gameplay it sticks to its independent roots. The main difference between E3 and the original game is E3's music adaptation, just like the other Tetsuya Mizuguchi's synesthesia titles (Lumines and Rez). E3's main arcade mode allows the player to advance through different stages, each of them featuring different background, enemy designs, music, bosses and a varying pace of play.

As in the original game you too are unable to shoot. The only way of defense is to detonate your "ship" in the vicinity of the enemy. Enemies appear in randomized patterns, and the main goal is to detonate at the right moment and position, to set up a chain reaction of explosions and earning a combo bonus. Blowing oneself up takes away from your overall stock of lives, with a new life being issued at specific amounts of points.

The original game has been included with the PSP version as well.</desc>

The player can play a variety of games with the pet, such as bowling, fishing or jumping on trampolines. The game encourages playing in different environments; by doing so the player has a chance of finding "treasures" - customization items. In a separate in-game area called Pet home the player may take care of the pet - feed it, wash it etc. and also change its appearance to their liking.</desc>

This beam acts like a magnet to attract the orb, and can be widened or narrowed for different effects. The orb can be changed into 3 different states: metal, wood and glass. In order to solve complex puzzles and overcome obstacles, the player must utilize all the different transformations of the orb and master control over the beam of light.

The game story revolves around a young boy named Erwyn, who has been captured and imprisoned by the evil Master Gardal. The boy's soul is pure and untainted, and if Gardal sacrifices Erwyn then Gardal may breach the gates of the Castle of Heaven - a fortress built to protect the world from dark forces. However, Erwyn's clairvoyant sister has sealed his soul within a protective orb, and it is her job to free the orb from captivity and guide it safely to the Castle of Heaven.</desc>

		<desc>This game is based on the animated television series Family Guy. It was also released for the PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox.

The game is split into 22 levels for the three playable characters: Peter, Stewie or Brian. Peter and Stewie have eight levels, while Brian has six. Each character has his own unique style of play.

A key feature of the game are mini-games done in the same style as the cutaway gags that the show is famous for, usually lasting less than 10 seconds. The mini-games often repeat cutaway gags from the shows, such as Peter inexplicably burning his hand in a waffle iron. Successfully completing the mini-game offers a bonus: Brian becomes invisible for a short period, while Peter and Stewie receive power-ups for their respective abilities.</desc>

		<name>Fat Princess : Fistful of Cake</name>
		<desc>Fast-paced and strategic, Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake pits two hordes of players against each other in a comic medieval battle on the PSP. The player's goal is to rescue a beloved princess from the enemy castle. There is a catch, though; the adversary has been feeding her magical cake to make her heavier to carry. Therefore, it will take much of the army working together to carry her across the battlefield. Team balance and strategy is crucial in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake because players can switch between five different character classes, literally, at the drop of a hat. The name of the game is cooperation, whether it is flinging another player over the enemy's walls with a teeterboard, healing him while he charges into battle, or adding muscle to carry the hearty princess to safety. The comical, quirky, and loveable cast of characters in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake has been developed specifically for optimization on the PSP. Now players can have their cake and take it on the go, too.</desc>

"Impact Punches" are one of the most drastic changes, along with ESPN Classic fights and a new career mode, in which the player fights to gain popularity in order to reach sponsored fights, or to be featured on ESPN. Unlike in older versions, Round 3 defaults without a heads-up display (HUD), allowing a player to judge the status of their stamina and energy based on their stance, movements, and facial features, instead of the usual stamina meter.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy</name>
		<desc>Back in 1987, Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy was supposed to be the last game in the Fantasy role-playing game series. However, destiny had other plans for Hironobu Sakaguchi and his creation. After twenty years and more than a dozen of canonical games the Final Fantasy franchise is still going strong and reaping the rewards of the original IP.

The original Final Fantasy game has already been re-released many times. The PSP version has been built upon the Game Boy Advance version of the game. It has bonus dungeons from the Gameboy/Wonderswan versions of the game but also features new improved graphics, all in 16:9 with easy to read big texts and better quality of music and general sounds. The CG intro from the PlayStation/Wonderswan version has also been redone in 16:9.

There is an entirely new dungeon dubbed "The Labyrinth of Time" which enforces a time limit within which you can explore its dark depths, and also another bonus: an unlockable Yoshitaka Amano Art Gallery which contains beautiful artwork from the artist who has provided the illustrations for many games in the series, and like in the GBA version there is also bestiary and a unlockable BGM music player. Other features do not change the GBA version much, even the the difficulty is the same as in Dawn of Souls.</desc>

		<desc>Frantix is a puzzle-based adventure game for PSP. It features over 180 different levels. Playing as one of the heroes, the objective of the game is to collect as many gems as possible in order to advance in the world of Frantix. Though there is no story explaining why our hero is venturing through this land of puzzles, it is clear that this must be done as quickly as possible. Each stage has a gem requirement, and you can exit when you have found the required amount. The puzzles are usually based on colored gems that open specific doors.

There are six worlds (including a tutorial) where you get past hazards such as water and quick sands, avoid patrolling creatures, collect gems, manipulate crates, sneak around, build bridges, and plant explosives. There are also power-ups that allow you to walk over certain surfaces, increase speed, or provide invincibility. With short levels, Frantix can be played for five minutes or an hour with the same satisfaction.</desc>

		<name>Full Auto 2 : Battlelines</name>
		<desc>Full Auto 2: Battlelines is the sequel to the auto racing combat game Full Auto, that debuted in February of 2006 on the Xbox 360. 

The PSP version of the sequel builds on the PS3 version but removes a few features for obvious reasons, resulting in more primitive damage modeling on the cars, less detailed environments and less multiplayer modes. This version does add new gameplay modes, new cars, weapons and a different storyline.

The game plays much like a mixture of Burnout and Twisted Metal. The PSP version focuses more on the Twisted Metal-style combat gameplay. During most events, winning a race is rarely a goal; the game is focused on destruction. The goals change from level to level, but most time they require eliminating a set number of enemies, or blowing up specific targets, random objects, or oncoming traffic. Unlike the PS3 version every objective needs to be completed to win the event.

The game contains two general game modes: Racing and Arena. The 'Unwreck' feature is also present and it allows the player to rewind time. The environment is however much less interactive. Most objects cannot be destroyed, only specific ones, for instance a lead pipe that lands on chasing cars. Most destruction is done to store fronts, bus stops, trash cans and other objects.

The game contains four-player Ad Hoc multiplayer. Players can race or fight in a free-for-all arena or as part of a team in multiplayer modes such as Head-On, Down &amp; Back, as well as Arena Deathmatch.</desc>

		<name>Gangs of London</name>
		<desc>In Gangs of London the player takes the role of a crime gang member who wants to take control over London. The basic gameplay premise reminds of the GTA series but instead of a free roaming experience the campaign consists of 70 short missions which are chosen through a menu screen. Every of them is accompanied with a story sequence in a comic style and features varied goals: escorting, infiltrating an enemy post, stealing cars, kidnapping people, racing, defending the own position against enemy waves and killing people.

The gameplay itself offers what one would expect from a game like this: if the player is on foot the game is basically a third person shooter - sometimes he has a few other gang members with him and can give them a few commands. The driving is action oriented in either first or third person and the stealth segments are basic and require only to perceive the guard's patrols and kill them from behind. The police intervenes if they see a crime but there is no wanted system like in similar games. At the beginning of the campaign the player has a choice between five gangs with different abilities, e.g. the Triads can drive faster.

Additionally the game features a big selection of playing modes and mini games, e.g. free roaming in London, driving taxi, photographing points of interests as tourist or fighting off zombies. The mini games in the pub can be played with two players: darts, bowling, pool and a Snake variant as arcade machine, The last noteworthy mode is a tactical game similar to Risk: The player takes control over a crime organization and tries to conquer London which is divided into about 30 districts. In every round he can perform three actions, e.g. move men to another district. Between rounds he can hire more men or acquire bonus cards which give certain advantages. There are three difficulty levels and several winning conditions for this mode.</desc>

		<desc>Ghost Rider is an action game set after the events of the movie of the same name, which is in turn based on the Marvel Comics character.

You are Johnny Blaze, who sold his soul to a demon named Mephisto for noble reasons.  Now, some rogue demons have escaped from hell and Mephisto needs to to destroy them before they cause him trouble.  If you don't, he'll take your girlfriend back to hell with him.

Ghost Rider attacks with his flaming hellfire chains in a manner similar to God of War.  If he uses a variety of moves and avoids being hit, it fills a vengeance bar.  The more this meter fills, the more souls he gets from enemies he kills.  Souls are used to purchase new moves and extras like additional characters.  There are some shielded enemies where you must have a minimum vengeance bar to damage them.  There is also a spirit gauge, which is essentially a special meter and is also built up by attacking.  It allows the uses of special moves, like your shotgun.

There are also Hellcycle levels, where you must successfully avoid obstacles while destroying enemies with the bike's hellshots attacks and your chains.</desc>

The actual game of Sudoku is fairly simple, and has nothing to do with mathematics at all - instead, it's all to do with logic. The numbers one to nine must fit horizontally and vertically in the 9x9 Sudoku grid - the catch is that the numbers one to nine must also appear in each of the nine smaller 3x3 grids.

The game features a short tutorial that shows you how to play, as well as a Training option which lets you play five easy puzzles with help. Multiplayer mode is also supported either by taking turns with one system (either co-operatively or competitively), or by playing wirelessly with up to four PSPs.</desc>

		<name>Gradius Collection</name>
		<desc>A compilation containing the arcade versions of the first four Gradius games as well as the previously PS1 exclusive game Gradius Gaiden. They are all exact conversions with some minor changes. While some versions had two-player co-op gameplay, all games in this compilation are single-player only. The triangle button is used for rapid fire, to combine shooting the regular weapon along with missiles.

The extras include videos from Gradius Deluxe Pack, Gradius III and IV and Gradius Gaiden. There is also a music gallery where the full soundtrack of the five included games is available. The games have also been adapted for different views (zoomed in and full) and the arcade ports include full options. A basic save and autosave system has also been implemented.</desc>

		<desc>The game is centered on an open-ended design. The single-player menu presents players with three variables ? Mode Selection (Time Trial, Single Race, and Drift Trial), Car Selection, and Track Selection. The player can pick and choose circuits and vehicles, with credits earned based on the difficulty, performance and number of laps they have chosen. Players can select from any number of laps, one to 99. There are 45 tracks (including layout variations) plus the added bonus of reverse on most tracks, which takes the track number close to 75. For the first time in the series, the game features the use of custom soundtracks that enables players to play their own songs while racing, but this option must first be unlocked by completing section B of the Driving Challenges. The music tracks can only be played if it is set on "MUSIC folder" and can be used for offline or online races.</desc>

As a soldier, Vic Vance has always protected his dysfunctional family, his country, and himself. One bad decision later and that job is about to get much harder. Kicked out onto the streets of a city torn between glamor and gluttony, Vic is faced with a stark choice: build an empire or be crushed.
GTA: VCS is the PlayStation Portable follow-up to Rockstar's monumental handheld entry in the series, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. As in Liberty City Stories, this game ventures back to the location of the second PS2 game.</desc>

		<name>Gretzky NHL 06</name>
		<desc>Gretzky NHL 06 for PSP is a hockey game endorsed by legendary player Wayne Gretzky. Released only six months after the previous PSP game, this version comes with updated rosters and several features taken from the PS2 version, but has its own selection of modes.

Returning modes include single games and a full season. The new chemistry feature makes its way over from the PS2, influencing players' stats depending on how well they interact with each other. Also seen on the PS2 is the "Wayne vs Wayne" mode, in which the two competing teams build up their "99 meter". When full, The Great One himself joins the team as an extra player for a short time. In addition to single games, this mode can also be played in the PSP-exclusive NHL Showdown mode, which is a ladder against all NHL teams, with the finale against a team of five Gretzkys. Another exclusive mode is called "3 on 3 Countdown". It is an arcade mode, with only three players per team on the field, without any of the regular rules, and the winner being the team that reaches a set score first.

Online multiplayer, both ad hoc and via infrastructure, also return, as do the Gretzky Challenges: by earning points through in-game achievements, players can unlock bonuses like alternate and vintage uniforms and new gameplay features and modes. Unlike the previous PSP game, Gretzky 06 features color and play-by-play commentary by Mike Emrick and Darren Pang.</desc>

The game is built around a tour mode where the player must complete the stages one by one. Clear these stages by driving fast to the finish or try to top the times required to obtain bronze, silver, and gold medals. There are also stars to collect and a hidden item on every stage to discover. All of the levels are afloat in the air, so if the player happens to drift off the course, the car drops into nothingness.

There are many multiplayer modes, including bonus games such as soccer, ice hockey and a Snake game played with cars. In the track editor, players can construct their own gravity-defying tracks and share them through a wireless connection.</desc>

		<name>Growlanser : Wayfarer of Time</name>
		<desc>Wayfarer of Time features an isometric perspective and a "traditional RPG" style exploration in towns, dungeons and world map that are very similar to the original Growlanser. Enemies can be seen on the world map and they can be avoided. Each dungeon has a unique, fixed layout (with the exception of the "bonus dungeon", which is randomly generated).

The equipment system is markedly different from most RPGs. Characters can equip two pieces of armor, one being a "Ring Weapon". In the Growlanser series, a Ring Weapon is a new technology where magic rings transform into different weapons depending on the user's personality. Players find these rings often after the defeat of an enemy and can equip different rings for different stat bonuses and different gem-equip slots. There are over 100 types of gems that cause various beneficial effects such as adding extra attacks, more elemental defenses, or increasing range or adding spells to the character's repertoire. These gems all have an innate level and that level must match or be lower than the slot available in the Ring weapon to be equipped. Each Ring Weapon only has 3 gem-slots with a level of 0-9 for each slot to equip the respective level gems. Additionally, a gem's color must match the color of a ring slot. A gem can be equipped into any given slot, however, penalties are incurred if the gem has a skill that can be learned.

There are 11 potential playable characters, but there is a four-member party limit in battles. The fate system allow players to save some characters from death based on their decisions and ultimately unlock some additional endings.</desc>

Unlike Half-Minute Hero, the sequel's episodes all consist of RPG gameplay similar to the Hero 30 mode of the original. However, they have been expanded with additional features more similar to a typical RPG, such as an explorable world, leveling outside of battle, weapon combining, formations, special classes, a more developed plot line and a home base, the Hero Castle, that doubles as a giant mecha.</desc>

		<name>Hellboy : The Science of Evil</name>
		<desc>Hellboy: The Science of Evil is the second game adaptation of Mike Mignola's popular comic book character (now also featured in films and an animated series). The story is unique to the game, and sees Hellboy travel through six different settings as he tracks down the evil Von Klempt. Hellboy faces his familiar enemies including various demons and Nazi creations. The game features brawler style action, with some puzzle and story elements interspersed throughout.

In The Science of Evil, Hellboy has several abilities that set him apart from the standard brawler character, including the ability to pick up and wield many environmental objects such as barrels and debris from structures knocked down with his Right Hand of Doom. He can also grapple enemies to finish them off one-on-one, or use them as projectiles.

Team up with a friend and attempt six co-op multiplayer levels over ad-hoc WiFi. These levels are derived from the single-player campaign, but have been shortened and re-worked to provide a set of two-player puzzles. Scores are tracked individually - so it doesn't have to be completely co-operative.

Hellboy: The Science of Evil was also released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, however the PSP version is not a port of that game. The story elements and characters are similar, but the PSP features a unique combat system, different AI and a new level layout more suited to the handheld environment.</desc>

		<name>Hot Pixel</name>
		<desc>Hot Pixel is a casual game happening in a pixellized universe mixed from street culture, digital lifestyle and old-school style video games. It consists of 200 micro games, randomly selected from the pool in one mode, or grouped together into 10 episodes in a second mode, linked together by cut-scenes featuring the teenager DJON.

Each micro game lasts only a few seconds, similar to the WarioWare games. During this short time limit, the player has to work out what he is supposed to do aided by a short sentence that appears when the game starts. There are also a number of tutorials and training modes. After clearing a set number of micro games the player is presented with a longer "boss" micro game which is generally more challenging in order to clear the level. Some of the games have suggestive themes or crude content.

By going through the games, new ones are unlocked or presented with different modes, such as the removal of the time limit. Other features include a rating mode for the different characters, music jukebox, a list of unlocked video segments, and playlists to compile a list of favourite games or share it through the internet or memory sticks. The playlists come with 3 modes: Challenge (play through a selection), Survive (try to keep playing for a set amount of time) and Freeplay. There is an Ad Hoc multiplayer mode to compete against a friend for the best score. Playing well fills a gauge. When maxed out, it can be used to send a "disturber" that modifies the opponent's screen display.

Some of the micro games use concepts of popular games such as Battlezone and Breakout. Additional games can be downloaded from the developer's website and are imported via a memory stick.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Hot Wheels - Ultimate Racing (USA).iso</path>
		<name>Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing</name>
		<desc>Ultimate Racing is the first game in the series of Hot Wheels licensees to appear on the PSP platform. Just like the other games, it is a straightforward racing game with a focus on arcade gameplay. The game offers three game modes:
Ultimate Challenge: win races to unlock new cars, tracks, challenges and performance upgrades.

Arcade Mode: quick play based on the unlocked content from the Ultimate Challenge mode.

Multiplayer Mode: quick races or checkpoint-based races for up to four players
In Ultimate Challenge, there are six main stages to choose from, with eleven tracks and twenty licensed cars in total. The game starts from a central warehouse where all unlocked cars are stored. These can be upgraded or customized in the garage. Next to the performance upgrades, players can tweak the colors of the body, glass, neon, wheels, and change the wheels and decals.

The Arcade Mode is further divided into different challenges: Quick Race, Survival Mode (complete a series of increasingly difficult races and avoid being kicked out), Collector (checkpoint-based races) and Time Trial.

Next to regular racing controls such as brakes and acceleration, players can also use NOS (boost) and Slow Motion (slow down time during difficult sections). The use is limited as it depletes a reserve. It can be refilled by passing by obstacles without hitting them or completing tricky jumps. Tracks, with themes such as Volcano, Jungle or Death Valley, are generally filled with obstacles, moving objects or animals. The focus is entirely on racing, there are no weapons or other offensive means and the cars can only be slowed down, unable to sustain damage.

There are three different camera settings and ghost cars are supported during time trials.</desc>

		<name>IL-2 Sturmovik : Birds of Prey</name>
		<desc>IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey, or Wings of Prey on the PC, is a combat flight simulator video game. As with previous installments of the PC series IL-2 Sturmovik, it depicts combat aircraft from World War II, although with less focus on realistic simulation than other entries in the series.[2] The game has a campaign mode in which players are able to fly the Allies against the Axis, and also a multiplayer mode in which they are able to select either faction.[3] A demo of the game launched on the PSN and Xbox 360's Xbox Live on 29 July 2009.[4]

Birds of Prey is based around the large-scale aerial combat and ground military operations of World War II. Players can participate in some of the warâ€™s most famous battles, piloting fighters, attack aircraft and heavy bombers across a range of missions. There are six theatres of war to engage in: The Battle of Britain, Stalingrad, Berlin, Sicily, Korsun and the Battle of the Bulge, representing the main airborne battles of World War II in Europe.

Birds of Prey has a new damage effects engine. Players can see real-time damage to the aircraft such as holes in the wings and trail lines during dog fights. IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey features hundreds of aircraft taking part in air battles. The environmental engine also produces high-detail, realistic landscapes that allow players to easily see ground support actions.[5]

The game was developed by Gaijin Entertainment, who subsequently developed Birds of Steel, also exclusively for consoles. Birds of Steel shares many traits with Birds of Prey (including HUD, aircraft models, controls, and menu design) but differentiates itself by concentrating primarily on USâ€“Japanese aerial battles of the Pacific theater.</desc>

		<name>Infected</name>
		<desc>Infected is a fast-paced third person comedy zombie shooter.  The focus is on a humorous plot and combo-based zombie killing.

It's Christmas time in New York and Zombies have come to ruin the festivities.  As New York Cop Agent Stevens, you find out that not only are you immune to the zombie virus, but your blood is actually so powerful, it will make a zombie explode.

The main focus of the gameplay is shooting holes in the zombies until they are weak enough for you to fire a vial of your own blood into them, causing an explosion.  Weaken enough zombies, fire a blood vial into one, and watch the chain reaction as exploding zombies send your anti-zombie blood onto other zombies.

The game was one of the first online PSP games, and featured a mode where defeating an opponent would give them your virus, and force their avatar online to look like your avatar.  If they in turn defeated someone, your virus would be passed onto them as well.  At any time you could look at a world map to see where on earth your strain of virus had travelled.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Iron Man (USA) (En,Fr,Es).iso</path>
		<name>Iron Man</name>
		<desc>Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven different platforms.

The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them back.

The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through more than 12 different missions and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through cinematics between every mission and use the voices of actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard.

By foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red and gold suit later, using range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles, micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful "Unibeam". Both the weapons and the suit (propulsion and armor systems) are upgradeable, and there are many special armors from the comics to unlock in most of the versions.

Differences in this version from the Xbox360/PS3 version consist of altered visuals and altered upgrade system (rather than spending money on them, the player's gear is upgraded based on how much it has been used).</desc>

		<desc>Jackass: The Game is a video game based on the television series Jackass. It was developed under license by Sidhe Interactive in Wellington, New Zealand for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The game was first shown at the 2006 E3 behind closed doors.

The Nintendo DS version of the game was developed by Sensory Sweep Studios in Salt Lake City, Utah.

All of the Jackass cast (excluding Bam Margera) and crew provided their own voices and supply their likenesses for the game, according to Sidhe Interactive. Johnny Knoxville and other members of the Jackass team also provided stunt ideas to the developer based on unused stunts from the show.[1] A trailer was released in June 2007 on the game's official website, along with the cover art.</desc>

		<name>Jeanne d'Arc</name>
		<desc>It is the 15th century, the time of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. A young French girl from the village of Domremy trying to assist her father with his daily labors discovers a mysterious object: an armlet that binds magically on her wrist. Soon the village is being attacked and finding the first sword she can, she steps forth to encounter the enemy, some humanoid beasts. Taking strength from the armlet, hearing a mysterious voice and having for assistance her close friends, she manages to defeat them and embarks on a long quest to help her countrymen and vanquish the evil forces invading France.

Jeanne d'Arc is a turn-based strategy RPG game of the Japanese variety, that fuses medieval history with fantasy and the craziness of Japanese anime. This is a well known story retold through tactical battles one after another, while game dialog along with hand drawn cutscenes twist the story into different territories from the original. 

It is a story of teen friendship and dedication, remorseless war, evil magic, unavoidable death, heartache abandonment and purifying hope. Jeanne joins the army and along with 14 other companions with different skills and personalities march to face England's Henry VI's troops. With her are other armlet wielders, able to use them and transform into fearsome warriors able to strike down evil at its core. The game features a map to move through locations where the battles which push the story forward happen along with free stages that add nothing more than fun, strong items and difficult bosses.</desc>

Locations correspond to those of the original version and are accessed in the same order, but have been re-designed with different layouts and mostly completely different puzzles which allow implementation of new moves introduced in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend: swinging on ropes and using a grappling hook at specific points.

Puzzles are generally more focused on acrobatics in this version, ledges being much more prominently featured as a level design element, requiring combinations of jumping and shimmying across them to access areas. This type of gameplay replaces the key-retrieval and block-pushing puzzles of the original almost entirely. Combat is similar to that of the first game, though the player must now manually activate targeting. Some boss fights have been made a separate enclosed stage rather than being part of the exploration as in the original version. These fights may have puzzle-solving elements and often require the player to use Lara's new "adrenaline dodge" ability, which slightly slows down time when the opponent charges at her while in an "enraged" state. Some cutscenes require the player to participate in quick-time events.</desc>

		<name>LEGO Star Wars II : The Original Trilogy</name>
		<desc>Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy is a multi-platform action-adventure video game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts and TT Games. It was released on September 11, 2006. Part of the Lego Star Wars series, it is based on the Star Wars science fiction media franchise and Lego Group's Star Wars-themed toy line. It follows the events of the Star Wars films Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The game allows players to assume the roles of over 50 Lego versions of characters from the film series; customized characters can also be created. Camera movement was improved from its predecessorâ€”Lego Star Wars: The Video Game; and the concept of "vehicle levels" was explored more thoroughly. The game was revealed at American International Toy Fair 2006. Promotions for the game were set up at chain stores across the United States.

Lego Star Wars II was critically and commercially successful; it has sold over 8.2 million copies worldwide as of May 2009. Critics praised the game for its comedic and "adorable"[2][3] portrayal of the film series and for their preference of the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy. However, the game's low difficulty, and its Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions in general, were received more poorly. The game received awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and Spike TV, among others. A mobile phone adaptation was later developed by Universomo, published by THQ, and released on December 19, 2006. Lego Star Wars and Lego Star Wars II were compiled in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, released on November 6, 2007. The OS X version of the game was released in April 2007 by Feral Interactive.[4]</desc>

		<name>The Lord of the Rings : Aragorn's Quest</name>
		<desc>The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest is a 2010 action-adventure video game developed by Headstrong Games for Wii, and TT Fusion for Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. It was published on all platforms by WB Games.

The game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film trilogy; The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). Set fifteen years after the War of the Ring, the game features Samwise Gamgee telling his children of the adventures of Aragorn during the conflict; his stories form the majority of the game's content. Aragorn's Quest was the first Lord of the Rings game released by WB Games, who had acquired the rights to make games based on the New Line Cinema film series from Electronic Arts in 2009.

The game was aimed primarily at younger players, offering a simplified and less violent version of the plots of the three films. It received mixed to negative reviews, with critics finding the combat repetitive, the narrative too truncated and the overall game too easy.</desc>

		<desc>The Lord of the Rings: Tactics is a completely original strategy game set in Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Players experience the entire trilogy, from the earliest battle at Weathertop to the final conclusion at Minas Tirith and Mordor.

Unlike other tactics games, which are strictly straightforward turn-based affairs, The Lord of the Rings: Tactics innovates in its system. Players assign their moves simultaneously with the AI, and then all the actions unfold. In this way, players must guess their opponent's intentions and try to block them before they actually happen. This keeps the action moving much faster than a traditional tactics game.</desc>

		<name>Lumines II</name>
		<desc>The sequel to the Lumines stays close the original puzzle game, but add some twists. The gameplay is identical: you arrange blocks, made of four smaller block pieces with two colours in total, to form shapes with an identical colour, as a square of four pieces or more. The blocks can be rotated and are stacked with the other blocks on the board. A vertical line crosses the screen and when it hits the right side, all combinations are removed, causing chain combos and clearing the board. You have to prevent the blocks from piling up and reaching the top of the screen. There are also special blocks you can use to remove many blocks at once. Games are played against colorful backgrounds and the speed of the timeline matches the music of the level, while the falling speed of the blocks increases as you get further in the game.

The game modes are either new or have been remixed. In the single-player Challenge mode, there are three difficulty classes. By clearing levels you unlock new music, skins and game modes. One of these are the Endurance challenge runs, where you have to play through all skins in the game. Next to games with regular skins, some backgrounds now have 3D animations or show music videos of popular artists. The sound effects and the design of blocks is often adapted to fit the music. For levels with music video skins, you cannot play through them at a quicker pace to clear the level as you have to keep going until the song ends.

The other single-player modes are Time Attack mode (get a high score with limited time, you can even record your session) and Puzzle mode where you need to create shapes. You can also challenge the computer in the VS CPU Mode. Here, you need to score more than your opponent to make his playing field smaller until he gets stuck. This game type is also available as the Duel mode against a human player through Wi-Fi. The order of the skins can be defined in the new Skin Edit mode. The Single Lap section allows you to make your own playlists for a set run, while the Endless Lap allows you to choose or exclude skins to keep playing as long as you like. There are 60 levels and 100 skins in total.

Another new feature is the Mission mode where more strategy is required. You are given specific tasks to clear boards with a limited amount of blocks or time. In the new Sequencer mode, you can compose your own songs. The game provides options to define the speed and 8 separate music sheets to place notes and effects on. The high scores, playlists from the Skin Edit mode, songs from the Sequencer mode and replays of the Time Attack mode can be exchanged with other players through Wi-Fi. Your performance is tracked in the Database mode where statistics of your playing sessions are available. The game also includes a demo of Every Extend Extra, another puzzle game by Q ENTERTAINMENT, Inc.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Manhunt 2 (USA).iso</path>
		<name>Manhunt 2</name>
		<desc>Manhunt 2 does not build upon the story and events of the first game. Instead, the same game mechanics are transferred to a new location, the Dixmor Insane Asylum, where the staff prefers to beat up the patients and experiment on them, rather than to offer treatment for their illness. One day a power outage allows the patients to revolt and bring mayhem to the asylum. The player gets the chance to play two roles: as Dr. Daniel Lamb and Leo Kasper. Although the beginning is set inside the asylum, the action soon moves to other locations.

The game mechanics are largely stealth oriented, while later levels offer more of a regular third-person shooter feel when more firearms become available. Gunplay requires extensive use of cover, maneuvers and sometimes stealth for success. There is a radar system, enemies have different levels of awareness and kills are best performed from the shadows. Players can throw objects to distract enemies or make noises into the USB headset to lure them away from their friends (PS2). To hide in the dark a quick mini-game needs to be performed. If it is not completed in time, the character's location will be revealed at once.

As in the first game players can perform executions, with three styles: Hasty (white), Violent (yellow) and Gruesome (red). These feature explicit violence including strangling, beatings, gun violence, setting them on fire and more. Some of these kills are however censored with blacked out scenes or the camera turning away. In the Wii version player need to mimic the motions needed for a kill with the combination of the Wiimote and the Nunchuk.

All versions are quite similar. The Wii edition includes three exclusive weapons (bottle, mace and a razor), while the other two versions have a weapon not found in the Wii game: a samurai sword. The Wii version is also the only one to include a short tutorial to familiarize the player with the controls. Other small changes in the Wii edition include more detailed environments, additional dialogue, new hunters (Sexual Deviants scene), some changes in weapon placement, a new manhole execution (in Ghosts), and more animations for Daniel and Leo, especially in close combat.</desc>

		<name>Marvel : Ultimate Alliance</name>
		<desc>Dr. Doom has united supervillains as the Masters of Evil. Now for the first time ever, over 20 Marvel superheroes including Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade and Silver Surfer have come together to stop Doom. Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.

Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team. 

You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes. 

Boss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.

The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.</desc>

		<name>Marvel : Ultimate Alliance 2</name>
		<desc>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and, before that, the X-Men Legends series It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose.

You start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by completing bonus simulator missions, which will give you a special task like blowing up cars. There are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they get knocked out. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. You can use SHIELD access points, usually at the beginning and middle of each level, to switch out characters. The stamina meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time.

Defeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage.

The big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. This is controlled by a meter of four stars. You fill this by defeating enemies or finding an item that instantly fills the whole meter. You can spend one star to revive a fallen teammate or all four to perform a fusion attack. Any possible combination of two characters has their own unique fusion. There are three basic types:

There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. These do high damage to a single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies.</desc>

		<name>Marvel Trading Card Game</name>
		<desc>Marvel Trading Card Game is a strict electronic conversion of the Vs. System collectible card game rules by Upper Deck. It includes cards from all of the Marvel-based Vs. sets through the X-Men set.

The gameplay involves head-to-head battles where players recruit superhero characters with various strengths and powers onto the playfield. Each character has a basic Attack and Defense value which determines the outcome of individual character battles. This basic mechanic is augmented by character powers, Equipment cards (which give the character additional powers/stats), Location cards (which affect multiple cards or game rules while they are face up), and Plot Twist cards (which are often played to change the outcome of individual character battles by boosting Attack or Defense values).

The game features two single player campaigns, tutorials, puzzles, and an online mode similar to Magic The Gathering Online. The online mode supports cross-platform play between the PC and PSP versions.</desc>

		<desc>Medal of Honor Heroes 2 is a first-person shooter game for the Wii and the PlayStation Portable. It is the 12th installment in the long-running Medal of Honor series of World War II games. Each version was built from the ground up for its respective system. The Wii version was announced at Nintendo's E3 2007 Press Conference on July 11, 2007. It may not be sold to people under 18 in Germany because of its USK rating.[2] Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 is set in World War II, starting on the Normandy beaches trying to control German bunkers and then move on to secure a village somewhere in France.

This is the second Medal of Honor game to be released for the Wii. The first was Medal of Honor: Vanguard.

To date, it is the last World War II era Medal of Honor game released.</desc>

		<desc>Set a century after the events in the original Mega Man series, Mega Man Maverick Hunter X is a remake of the original SNES game Mega Man X, and details the story of Dr. Light's greatest creation: X, a robot with free will. Dr. Cain's discovery of X led to the creation of reploids, robots modeled after the design of X. When the maverick virus infects a group of reploids, they band together in a revolt against humanity. The call goes to the maverick hunters, X and Zero, to fight the Mavericks.

The game is a side-scrolling action game where the player controls X as he hunts the maverick reploids. Notable features include the ability to find enhancements to augment X's abilities, and the ability to absorb the powers of the maverick reploids X defeats. The original moves, such as dashes, wall jumps and charge shorts are still present.

The original flat backgrounds have been replaced by polygonal models, and the remake features enhanced explosions and generally more detail. Additionally, animated cutscenes and voice acting have been added. All weapon and armour upgrades have been relocated to new hidden areas, and there is a new mode: Vile, in which you can play the entire game as maverick Vile, with abilities Mega Man does not have. As a bonus, there is a demo of Mega Man Powered Up on the UMD - a remake of the very first Mega Man game.</desc>

		<desc>Dr. Light had an idea: He would build a bunch of good and handy robots to help him and others to make the world a better place. One of these robots is named "Mega" and is designed to help Light around the lab in various tasks. One day, evil Dr. Wily attacks the lab and turn all of the robots evil too. All except Mega. Dr. Light sends Mega to stop these robots and thus, Mega Man is born.

Mega Man: Powered Up is a semi-remake of the original Mega Man.
There is an "Old Mode", where one tackles the adventure just like it was in the olden days, with the exception of an added feature to save game. The graphics are souped up, but the level layout is basically the same than in the original with a few minor changes here and there.
Then there's the "New Mode" which also features the original level themes and bosses but the levels themselves are boosted with various hidden areas and features which are mostly impossible to get to with Megaman only. The Player must defeat the bosses after which they'll be available as playable characters and use their special abilities to find everything in every level.

The third mode is the Challenge Mode where there is 100 different challenges to tackle and in which one has to dispatch as many enemies as possible in a given amount of time, get to the specific goal in a given amount of time and so on.

In addition to these two main game modes, there is a level editor that can be used to build the Megaman level of one's dreams and play it or send it to the internet where other gamers can download and play it.</desc>

		<name>Mercury Meltdown</name>
		<desc>Mercury Meltdown is the sequel to Archer Maclean's Mercury, a puzzle game where your job is to guide a blob of mercury, or several blobs, along various mazes, by tilting the game world, while hazard try to zap, attract, repulse, eat, or blow you up.

Mercury Meltdown features a new vibrant visual style, a lot of completely new stages, a free-look camera, ghost mercuries and replays for your best times that can be saved, and much more. The game's original realistic graphics have been turned into a more cartoon style. The mercury now has a black line around the outside of it.

The main change in the game is the ability to change the mercury into 3 more states. Besides normal state now you can turn the mercury into the "Fast" or "Slow" using a heater and a cooler, and using a solidifier you can make it unto "Solid" state, a round, non-breakable ball. The mercury can still be split using a splitter, needed to solve certain puzzles.

Unlike the original Mercury, the game is split into themed "Labs"  rather than “Worlds”. There are 10 Labs, with 16 initial stages: Astro, Bio, Chemical, Electro, Geo, Atom, Aero, Hydro, Micro, V.R. (Virtual Reality). The PS2 version adds two more: Chrono and Cryo, as well as twin analog control, support for the rumble feature, improved graphics and all the levels from the original Archer Maclean's Mercury. There are 168 stages in the PSP version and over 200 in the PS2 game. Unlike the previous game, there is no strict order to play the levels. Once a Lab has been unlocked, you can play all the stages included right away.

Attributes show how well you do in the games. The best performance is awarded with a golden cork, based on four conditions: a high score (a 1 sticker), all bonus items found (a star sticker), 100% mercury (a corked test-tube), and complete the level within the time limit. While playing, your progress is measured in faces that replace the time clock. The time limit cannot cause the game to end anymore, instead it just turns into a sad face and players can still complete the level. The mercury limits have also been removed, but 100% mercury is still needed to access some of the later stages.

The top right corner shows a color chart, to help with mixing colors in the game. This can also be done in the paintshop. This release adds multi-paintshops, triangle base pyramid shaped constructions with 3 different coloured gates on either side.

In addition to the main game, there are now five party games, which are unlocked by collecting the bonus stars in the main game:

1. Metrix: puzzle games where coloured blocks need to be fit inside a pre-defined grid.

2. Paint: move the mercury to paint the tray as much as possible against your opponent.

3. Race: guide mercury around speedy track with boost pads and avoid falling off.

4. Rodeo: tilt the playing area to keep the mercury on the field, while a fan tries to knock you off.

2. Shove: aim the mercury for the center spot of the target, just like curling.

All the party games can be played in multiplayer over Wi-Fi on the PSP. The tutorial is now separate from the main game, and there is an additional Playground mode where you can test the different items in the game.</desc>

		<desc>Miami Vice is a third-person shooter for the PlayStation Portable. It was released as a tie-in with the movie of the same name. Therefore, the likeness of the narcotics officers Crockett and Tubbs are based on that of Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, respectively.

While going through levels, the majority of the gameplay is combat, with enemies who must be killed to advance the level. Emphasis is put on taking cover, with health running out quite fast if player remains in the open during a shoot-out. All fire-arms have laser sightings, which acts as an aiming reticule.

The player may also deal drugs amongst other suppliers, both buying and selling. Drugs can be bought at one point and kept for several days, in which they may increase in value, thus making a profit for the player. Additionally, varying drugs can be obtained throughout each of the levels, and sold for a profit once the level is complete. Drugs can also be sold to informants for information.</desc>

Like the DS game, your calculations, reflexes, judgment and memory are tested, and there is an option to try and solve a daily series of problems, from which the age of the brain is then computed. It includes 49 exercises in 4 genres of calculation, reflex, judgment, and memory. Mind Quiz was supervised by Dr. Kawashima, the Japanese authority on Functional Brain Imaging.

It also has online gameplay to play against family and friends, and a mock exam, which evaluates comprehensive strength. By establishing new records, a Healing gallery is opened, with images of animals.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Monster Hunter Freedom (USA).iso</path>
		<name>Monster Hunter Freedom</name>
		<desc>Monster Hunter Freedom is a port of the Japan-only Monster Hunter G, a sort of follow-up to the original Monster Hunter - more of a director's cut of the game. While a good deal of the game mirrors the Playstation 2 original, there have been a large number of additions. There are now more quests, more monsters, more weapons, more armor and more areas around town to use to your advantage.

You now have a farm that sits just outside of town. You'll have access to some mining veins, bug catching spots, a dock for catching fish and a garden. This means that now you can gather materials when you're between missions, which doesn't eliminate the need to gather things while on the hunt, but it does make it less of a hassle. Another extra area is the training school. Here you can partake in hunts with specific limitations; you have a specified item and equipment layout, and have to take on larger prey within a shorter time limit. It's tough to be sure, but it also opens up the ability to produce some very special and powerful new weapons.

There are some insanely difficult hunts you can take later in the game. As for the new creatures, they run the gamut from having added colors (with new armor options to match) to totally new monsters (like a battle-worn wyvern with a huge mean streak). As an added bonus, not only can you make new types of armor from these new critters, but you can (in some cases) make more armor from classic monsters.

The controls on the PSP are a little different. While the PSP does lack two shoulder buttons and a second analog stick, players just press two face buttons instead of swinging the right analog stick. Triangle, Circle, and Triangle and Circle combined unleash three different types of attacks, while holding the right shoulder button blocks (or charges to attack if you're using a hammer). Multiplayer is limited to Ad-Hoc, so no going online to form a hunting party.</desc>

		<desc>Monster Hunter Freedom 2 is the sequel to Monster Hunter Freedom, based on the PlayStation 2 predecessor Monster Hunter 2, which was never released outside Japan. This game is not a direct port from PlayStation 2 release. New features have been added while others were removed to make the game appropriate for its new portable form. For example, there are item boxes used as global deposits allowing to store items and access them any time without entering "home".

The game features most elements from its predecessor, and you still need to fulfil missions - hunt monsters, gather materials and use them to create better equipment. Unlike the original game in Monster Hunter Freedom 2 all missions can be finished solo. The game world has also been expanded and now includes more unique territories for players to explore.

Multiplayer is still limited to Ad-Hoc, but the game features online downloadable quests which often provide special materials that can create bonus equipment impossible to create otherwise.</desc>

		<name>N+</name>
		<desc>N+ is an enhanced version of the game N, originally a flash based browser game. Players control a small, but very agile ninja through different small areas. Next to movement, only a single button is used to jump, but this allows the ninja to run up walls, do wall jumps and cross large distances.

Levels are divided over different episodes unlocked gradually. Each level consists of a single screen with a time limit. The amount of time can be replenished by collecting golden coins, but the main goals is to activate the exit, usually by touching a specific button or opening a number of doors. Areas are filled with hazards such as spikes and droids that shoot laser or rockets. There are also obstacles such as platforms that only move in a single direction or falling damage from high platforms. Death is always instant, but the player is given an unlimited amount of tries.

The PSP version includes a mix of original levels and user-created ones with about 200 in total. There is also a level editor and unlike the Xbox 360 version these can be shared with other players. The PSP version shows the levels from a "medium" distance, while the DS version contains a far view and a close view on the screens. Physics are also slightly different in each version.

There are both competitive and cooperative game modes available in multiplayer sessions. Players can switch between the pure mode with original graphics and the plus mode with enhanced visuals. The unlockables includes victory screens, new music and new colours for the ninja.</desc>

		<desc>A kart-race game with Pac-Man and other characters from previous Pac-Man games and other Namco franchises. For instance the PlayStation Portable version features Mr. Driller, Mappy and the Prince from Katamari Damacy .

The game is packed with not only the traditional Dots to consume and enemies to avoid, but also with power-ups and temporary advantages which players should use strategically to win the race and beat opponents. One example is a power slide to turn corners at full speed. Of course, enemies can also be bitten after eating a Power Pellet.</desc>

		<name>PaRappa the Rapper</name>
		<desc>The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny Funny, and going out on a date with her.  But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!

PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.

Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!

The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.</desc>

		<name>Phantom Brave : The Hermuda Triangle</name>
		<desc>Phantom Brave is a strategy RPG which takes place in the world of Ivoire. Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.

The game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.</desc>

		<desc>The big city of Collosatropolis has reached the limits of its expansion. The Collostropolan leaders have decided to solve the problem by invading the neighboring country of Mungola. Since Mungolans are simple, earthy types they don’t expect much of a struggle. Mungola’s defense force consists only of a single squadron of fighter planes – the F-27 Platypus.

Platypus is a side-scrolling shooter, where you use your little space craft to blast the enemy ships. Shooting some formations gives the player weapon upgrades for twenty seconds. All models in the game were designed in clay, photographed and then digitally coloured. There is 20 levels in four different worlds each with their own themes and enemies.

The PSP version includes minor changes. It adds worlds, ships, and enemies not in the original game, constructed from existing graphics, with new movement patterns. The weapon balancing and bonus scoring system have been changed. Enhancements include a save system, a new Survival mode and Wi-Fi multiplayer action for 2 players.</desc>

The friends Hannah, Claire, Vicky, Roger and Mitch need to free themselves by racing pocket cars on tracks, where winning races is awarded with soul gems and soul shards that can return them to their human form.

Races are grouped together in different soul challenges with identical gameplay but different settings such as a garden or a bathroom. Since the cars are very small, the roads are loaded with huge items such as bottles and everyday appliances. The tracks have short-cuts, jumps and slopes, as well power-ups that destroy the environment, provide rockets or freeze the opponent's car. There are four camera perspectives (all third-person) and a button to reset the car when straying away from the track.

Next to the soul races there are time trial and practice modes. The car park has many vehicle models with different statistics, liveries and decals. Most of these still need to be unlocked at the start of the game. Aside from single-player games, there are online play modes with game modes as race, soccer, and domination.</desc>

		<desc>PoPoLoCrois is an isometric cel shaded retro-style RPG. This PSP version is the first entry in the series to be released outside of Japan. It is a remake of the first two PoPoLoCrois titles for the PlayStation seamlessly reworked into a single game with various enhancements. You play as the 10-year old Prince Pinon who needs to find way of saving his sleeping beauty mom, and the whole kingdom, from Ancient Evil.

While playing you are able to pick up different characters to form a party, each with a different personality and combat style. Battles occur randomly and they become semi-strategic turn-based if you turn off the default auto combat option. Combat doesn't take you to a different screen, it just defines a spot in the background moving it to a diagonal grid, where you will move and fight the enemy. In these fights, there are many battle options, from special skills to tag-team attacks. Actions are based on an action gauge that fills up. The game can be saved manually or automatically.</desc>

		<name>PQ2 : Practical Intelligence Quotient 2</name>
		<desc>PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 (also known as PQ2; Intelligent License 2 in Japan) is a puzzle game for the PlayStation Portable, and a sequel to PQ: Practical Intelligence Quotient. The game is based on testing the model of human intelligence developed by Dr. Masuo Koyasu at Kyoto University.

PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 shares many features with the first PQ game and similar platform-like puzzle games. In each stage, the player controls a human avatar in a virtual reality world, climbing and dropping from levels, lifting, dropping, pushing and pulling boxes in order to activate switches and lifts, block laser beams, and to create stairways in order to reach an exit point. The player must also avoid guards that make rounds on the level.

The main game is presented as an intelligence test of 100 stages. The player is given a total cumulative time of 5 hours to complete all 100 puzzles; time is only counted while the player is performing the puzzles, and the player can save and come back at any time without time penalty. The player's score is based on the number of "moves" (excluding walking around) on the stage, the time it took to complete it, and the number of attempts at that stage. A player can skip a stage with a scoring penalty; levels not completed in the 5 hour limit are also penalized against the player. Once completed, the player can upload their score to worldwide scoring tables to compare their results.

Obstacles in levels include:

Boxes. Small opaque boxes can be picked up and dropped, and their height is the maximum height that the avatar can climb up on, thus these are commonly used to make stairs. Larger boxes can be pushed or pulled.
Glass boxes. These boxes operate like regular boxes, but will shatter if dropped from any height or hit by something dropped on them. They also are translucent and will allow both laser and regular light through.
Laser boxes. Like regular boxes but have laser beams that come out of one end. Crossing the beams will prematurely end the level.
Switch panels and switch boxes. Colored switches, when active, will activate platforms that may move across the field or that increase height, while deactivating a switch will cause these platforms to return to their original position. Floor panels are active by stepping on them or placing a box on them, while switch boxes require a laser beam to hit them.
Teleporters. These can be moved like boxes and will teleport the avatar between the end points.
Police officers. These characters roam from one police call box to the next closest one, and shine a line in front of them. Should the avatar be caught in this light, the level must be restarted. The police call boxes can be moved to alter the police officier's behavior.
Detectives. These characters will follow a specific roaming path until they discover footprints left by the avatar. At this point, they will follow the footprints until either the trail is lost, they find an obstacle they cannot pass through, or until they catch the avatar (which then will restart the level). Footprints will disappear after a number of steps, but can also be manipulated by using boxes and other obstacles.
PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 introduces the ability to create one's own levels to share with friends, and a "weekly quiz" that can be downloaded through the Internet.</desc>

		<name>Pursuit Force</name>
		<desc>Five different gangs are terrorizing the cities, namely Warlords, Capelli Family, Killer66, Vixens, and Convicts. Cities are in chaos as the regular police is helpless. Therefore, a special unit is formed to deal with such a threat, a special unit called the Pursuit Force. You are part of that unit.

Your task is to hunt down the criminals and let none escape. To do so, you will drive your fast car on the streets while being perfectly able to switch the vehicles on the run. Yes, on the run, you can jump from car to car during high speed, usually jumping on the different cars from the criminals and taking them out one by one. But there's more to that than just driving different cars, you can drive motorcycles, trucks, boats, even commandeer a helicopter, though there are occasions you'll have to deal with the criminals on foot.

You can select Time Trial, Race, or Career mode. The latter one plays story-wise which gives you certain variety of cases to choose from. As you get promoted while successfully solving the cases, new cases will become available depending upon your rank, from mere Officer to police Commander. This is a highly fast-paced game with non-stop action, as most missions leave very little room for mistakes.</desc>

		<name>Puzzle Chronicles</name>
		<desc>Puzzle Chronicles is a casual game that combines item-matching puzzling with RPG elements, including character progression and a fantasy story line in the vein of Infinity's earlier titles Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords and Puzzle Kingdoms.

The puzzle part is played on a board with vertical divider line in the middle. The goal is to push the divider line back to decrease the opponent's territory until no more moves are possible. This is done by matching groups of three gems into like colours along the divider line. These groups fall on the board horizontally. Pushing the divider line back is done by destroying rage gems. There are also special abilities and a sidekick known as a Warbeast that attacks the enemy when a sufficient amount of gems of certain colour has been cleared.

Removing gems also enables the player to collect mana, power spells and items that are then used to attack the opponent and reduce their board space. In addition to the main puzzle game, there are five other mini-games ranging from upgrading the Warbeast companion to crafting new items, while navigating a number of different maps and completing simple quests.</desc>

The conflict eventually ground to a halt and an uneasy truce was reached, as neither nation had the resources to continue fighting. Even so, the animosity between the two parties never faded, but smoldered beneath the surface, always threatening to explode into flames. In the resulting tenuous peace, the people of the peninsula began to resume their normal lives, always aware that the war could resume at any time.</desc>

		<desc>Rainbow Islands Evolution is a game in the Bubble Bobble series for the PSP system. It is also known as New Rainbow Islands Hurdy Gurdy Daibouken in Japan. It is an enhanced remake of the arcade game Rainbow Islands.

Bub and Bob, the two main characters in the series, are against an evil recording company that seeks to pollute the Rainbow Islands' atmosphere by creating constant musical noise, therefore wilting the flora and mutating the fauna. In this game, Bub and Bob use a hurdy-gurdy (an old European musical instrument) as a weapon to create the rainbows.

The game follows the same vertical-scrolling system from the original, but it expands to a third dimension as there are platforms in the background which become accessible through the course of the game.

The game suffers from reviews stating that it had been overworked with new features, especially those that make this version of the game differ significantly from the original game.</desc>

		<desc>The first Rengoku was a surprise hit for many PSPÂ® gamers. Featuring a compelling story about a cyborg yearning to escape its life of never ending battle, Rengoku provided a new and exciting world to battle through on the PSPÂ®. 

Now gamers will return to the world of Rengoku as they battle their way through the towering structure of Purgatory and the Seven Deadly Sins! Rengoku 2 builds upon the first game with improved level design for more strategy, smoother control, exciting new fighting mechanics that allow for attack combos, and deeper customization. With network support for up to four players via AD HOC, more levels, an explosive soundtrack by Hong Kong composer, Chan Kwong Wing, and character designs by legendary manga artist, Jun Suemi, Rengoku 2 is a deep and more challenging action experience.

The game features a nice selection of 24 tracks, 58 cars and music from all previous RR-games and in all aspects is faithful to the series' spirit. There are many game modes in the game, like a world tour-mode where player competes on the courses in order to earn new cars and tracks, Time Attack where one races around the tracks against time and also a multiplayer mode, which supports the ad-hoc, meaning that up to eight players can race against each other with only one game disc, with one player hosting, and others joining.</desc>

		<name>Rock Band Unplugged</name>
		<desc>Rock Band Unplugged is an expansion of the Rock Band series of music video games released for the PlayStation Portable. The game is developed by Backbone Entertainment in conjunction with Harmonix and is distributed by MTV Games and Electronic Arts. The game was released in North America and Europe on June 9, 2009.

The core game is functionally similar to the note-matching gameplay of Harmonix's previous titles, Frequency and Amplitude, with the player responsible for playing all four instrumentsâ€”lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocalsâ€”using the Portable's controls. Game modes are similar to Rock Band's, and the soundtrack includes a number of songs that have already been a part of the Rock Band series. Additional tracks will be a time-limited exclusive to Unplugged before they are released as downloadable content for the console games. The game supports the addition of new songs that can be purchased through the PlayStation Store.

Rock Band Unplugged, in addition to being released separately, was also released as part of a "Limited Edition Entertainment Pack" that also includes a Rock Band Unplugged-branded PSP, a 4GB memory card, and a voucher to download the movie School of Rock. A voucher for an exclusive 5-song demo of "Rock Band Unplugged" that is compatible with downloadable content is included with the PSP Go.</desc>

		<desc>Samurai Warriors: State of War (æ¿€ãƒ»æˆ¦å›½ç„¡åŒ, Geki Sengoku Musou) is a portable version of Samurai Warriors, however, it is not a straight conversion. It is more like Dynasty Warriors for the PlayStation Portable, giving it an "Empires" style of playing.

The gameflow is mainly separated into two stages: the Strategy phase and the Action phase. During the first stage, the map is separated into colored squares and the player is asked to move their character in a turn-based fashion. Terrain affects how the player can act during this stage. What usually follows is the action phase, which asks the player to defeat as many opponents possible within 60 seconds. These stages can tip the battle in the player's favor.

There are four main armies for the player to participate in: the Takeda (Western), Uesugi (Eastern), Nobunaga, or the solo army. Completing the game with these four factions unlocks the final stage in the game. It guest stars characters from Dynasty Warriors 4. The game features a Story mode, Free mode and VS mode.</desc>

		<name>Shadow of Destiny</name>
		<desc>Set in a fictional German town named Lebensbaum (Life's Tree), Shadow of Memories revolves around a 22-year-old man named Eike Kusch, who dies in the beginning of the game from being stabbed after leaving a small diner. However, he is resurrected by Homunculus (voiced by Charles Martinet in English), a djinn or genie, who offers to send him back in time to prevent his death and gives him the time-traveling digipad. Eike explores four erasâ€”2001, 1980, 1902 and 1580â€”as he attempts to unmask his killer and figure out a way of stopping his own murder at various points in the present. Along the way he encounters several characters: Dana, a modern-day waitress whom he accidentally brings back to the year 1580 and loses; the present-day fortune teller, who tells Eike the hour of his death; Eckart Brum, the curator of a private art museum who lost his wife and infant daughter in a shooting; Dr. Wolfgang Wagner, an alchemist living in 1580 with his wife, Helena, and their two children, Hugo and Margarette; and Alfred Brum, the great-grandfather of Eckart.

Given a red stone by Dana, Eike follows the Homunculus' instructions to give the stone to Wagner. Time-traveling ten days later, Eike discovers that the result of Wagner's experiment destroyed the lab and caused Hugo, already upset by his mother's death due to a lingering illness, to build a time machine and track Eike down with the intent of killing him. Depending on the player's actions, Hugo holds either Margarette or Dana hostage in the present and plans to use the red stone, revealed to be the Philosopher's stone, to resurrect his mother.</desc>

		<name>Shaun White Snowboarding</name>
		<desc>Shaun White Snowboarding gives the player, as the title suggests, a snowboard and sends him off to four ski run locations around the world (Europe, Alaska, Japan and a fictitious location called Park City) under the watchful eye of professional snowboarder Shaun White himself as well as other professionals, moderators, pilots and such. But before the player can go on the slope, he has to create his character by choosing not only from different body looks but also from different clothes and snowboards.

During the course of the game the player earns money by completing the challenges which can in return be invested in more stylized clothes and additional types of snowboards. Each of the boards has six stats like balance or speed and not all of them are the best possible option for every given situation. While in a race speed is an important factor, a board with a higher rating in rotation allows for better stunts.

The game puts the player in an open world with him free to roam around the slope as he pleases. Several lifts and even a helicopter bring him to different starting locations but if he wants, he can also walk and discover hidden areas by doing so. By doing tricks, with controls using mainly the analog sticks similar to Skate, the player earns respect points. And on the track are, besides many obstacles to perform tricks on, challenges like the Jibfest, in which only tricks on rails and boxes count or Freestyle in which every trick counts. Others include the Death Race, in which the player needs to get to the goal before everyone else but as the name suggests, everything is allowed including ramming opponents and throwing snowballs to get them off-balance. There are also some challenges like King of the Hill that can only be done with at least one other human player joining in.

The multiplayer mode is basically an extension of the single player experience. Everything that is available in single player, can also be done with other players online or over LAN. The other players are also just dropped into the open world with the freedom to just do what they want on the server.</desc>

This definitive version includes content never before seen in North America. Reformatted to take advantage of the PSP hardware, this remake includes a new widescreen aspect ratio, redone music and sound, and all new animation, presenting the story better than ever before.

		<path>./Games/Sid Meier's Pirates! (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).iso</path>
		<name>Sid Meier's Pirates!</name>
		<desc>Sid Meier's Pirates! for the PSP is a mix between the PC and Xbox version that were released two and three years earlier, respectively. As a straight port, not much has changed except for three really notable elements.

First, the dancing sequences have been tweaked slightly. Now it is up to your twitch/reaction time to get the job done right, as opposed to being able to simply watch the govenor's daughter's hand motions and body language.

The second tweak is the addition of being able to physically hunt for treasure. In the previous versions, you would find a map, sail to the right spot and land. If you had the location right, you would have your booty. Not so in this version. Now you take four of your crewman ashore and have to find the red "X". All while avoiding booby-traps and vicious jaguars. If you lose your crew, it's back to the ship. If you make it to the "X", then it is time to start raking in the doubloons.

The third change has been made to the sneaking segments. If you want to sneak into a port, it is handled in the exact same way; creeping through the streets, slipping past guards, hiding behind fences and so on. However, your character now moves in a grid, as opposed to being able to move a bit more freely. This does not change the gameplay, but it is possible to accidentally step into a guard's line of sight because you cannot stop moving forward until your character reached the middle of the next tile.

Next to the original game content, the PSP version adds bonus treasure missions, with more plunder and new locations. The game has been tweaked for widescreen display. Multiplayer is supported for up to 4 players, through Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc.</desc>

		<desc>The Navy SEALs are invading the PSP for a second covert campaign, one that will take handheld owners through 14 non-linear missions with dynamically changing objectives. Commanders guide a two-man team across multiple terrain types as they strive to build "command equity" and "local influence" through successful stealth and tactical operations. By rescuing civilians, completing goals, and uncovering bonus objectives, players will earn points to spend on weapons or military support in the form of supply drops and air strikes. Black market equipment and intelligence can also be acquired from the local populace, improving the SEAL team's chances for success.

An entry in the SOCOM series wouldn't be complete without multiplayer options, and Fireteam Bravo 2 includes wireless support for up to 16 players in both Ad-hoc and Infrastructure modes. Three new game types are introduced in this sequel, including a capture-the-flag variant, and users are now able to create custom tournaments, ladders, and even clan challenges. Fireteam Bravo 2 also offers an improved friends list and instant messaging to help simplify the process of finding worthy teammates and opponents. As in the first PSP title, Fireteam Bravo 2 lets owners of the PS2 version link the two games to unlock special features in both SOCOM titles.</desc>

		<path>./Games/SOCOM - U.S. Navy SEALs - Tactical Strike (USA).iso</path>
		<name>SOCOM : U.S. Navy SEALs, Tactical Strike</name>
		<desc>Tactical Strike is the third hand-held game in the long-line of the SOCOM series. This one differs from its console cousins. Not only can the player choose to control a squad of US Navy Seals, but the player can alternatively decide to control one of several foreign units that have roles comparable to the SEALS, such as the Dutch KCT, German KSK, Australian SASR, the Italian 9th Parachute Assault Regiment, the Spanish UOE, the British SAS, the French GIGN or the South Korean 707th Special Mission Unit.

The story takes place in Panama, as the players national ambassador and the Panamanian ambassador are seized by a local group of rebel narcotrafficante kidnappers, referred to as "La Mano Los Gente" -- though it is worth noting that this is egregiously ungrammatical Spanish, since it would translate literally as "The Hand The People," because the "de" is missing! The fictional group of criminals, with their comical name, hold the pair for ransom and it is up to the player to conduct an increasingly complex and difficult operation in order to rescue the two diplomats.

The gameplay is different from other SOCOM games, in that there remains a squad of four men to control, but instead of bringing up a menu interface and then pointing the cursor to a certain location to give an order, this new game features a locator box that is moved along the surface of the ground. This lets the player choose a specific target location or rally point as the case may be, and then to use a certain button to instruct soldiers to take cover, establish crossfire, defend, ambush, etc. One can, of course, order them to use particular weapons such as close combat knives, rifles, satchel charges for demolition, pistols, a shot fired by the squad's sniper, or thrown grenades. When choosing an aimpoint to throw a grenade, a dynamically adjustable moving arc appears, to show what trajectory it will follow.

There are nine different non-linear missions to play, with the option of two instant action missions for each stage, and the story is told with pre-rendered cut-scenes.</desc>

You can choose from five characters: Sonic, Knuckles, Shadow, Silver, and Metal Sonic. There are six zones in the story mode, split into two acts with a boss at the end of the second act. Defeating bosses is not sufficient, players also need to do it before the opponent gets the job done. Next to the story mode, there is also a challenge mode and a cup mode. In the wireless play mode players can challenge other PSP owners. While racing, players can collect power-ups with special attacks. Opponents can also be pushed around during the race.

Players can also collect cards by completing certain tasks in the game and these cards can be traded in the wireless play mode.</desc>

Characters still obtain various power ups throughout the stage to attack their rival.  The Boss stages are also the same in that you have to defeat the boss before your rival does. Players still collect cards for completing various challenges.

The playable character roster includes all the characters from the previous game (Sonic, Knuckles, Shadow, Silver, and Metal Sonic) along with the addition of Tails, Espio the Chameleon, and Rouge the Bat. 

There is an added Freeplay mode so that you may play stages previously cleared without having to race against another character.  Some additions were made to the multiplayer challenges including Knockout, Ring Battle, Race, King of the Hill, Capture the Chao, and Tag play modes.</desc>

Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978 classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync with the onscreen action.

Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming fleet of invaders before they reach the ground.  The main objective is to get as many points as possible before running out of lives.

Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.

Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other.  The Nintendo DS version also has a feature for online ranking.</desc>

Unlike the first game, however, the sequel is much more open-ended (a la Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), allowing Spider-Man free reign to explore New York City, and doing everyday tasks from stopping muggers, bank robberies and car-jackers, to delivering pizzas and snapping photos for the Daily Bugle.  

However, the action becomes even more intense as not only does Spidey have to keep the streets safe in general for the citizens of Manhattan, he also has to face up against such super villains as Rhino, Shocker, Mysterio and Calypso, as well as a few entanglements with the Black Cat along the way to square off against Dr. Octopus and save New York in the process!</desc>

With a different front end interface to previous versions, which looks like a mix between MTV and a doodle book, you select the challenge you want to take part in rather than boarding your way to the event as previous versions.

With improved controls making "Monster Jumps" (Uber Tricks) easier to perform, everyone can look like a professional without learning button combos. As before, if you perform the same trick over and over, you won't get the points to take your skier/snowboarder from a novice to what they have a labeled "black-diamond-dominating rockstar".

The game promises big jumps, fast pace and lots of coloured, detailed slopes.

The GameCube version delivers Mario, Luigi and Peaches on the slopes as special characters. Each has their own moves and is accompanied by Mario-style music.</desc>

		<desc>Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes bridges the gap between season one and two of the animated TV series. In the game the player learns more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunts down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska in a gameplay style very similar to Lego Star Wars.

The game is fully built around drop in/drop out-coop for two players. This means each mission in this 3rd-person-action-adventure features two famous characters from the TV series including Obi-Wan Kenobi, the padawan Ahsoka and Captain Rex but separated by class. The players either control commandos or Jedi characters - never both mixed as they have totally different abilities and limitations. If no second player is available, the AI will automatically take over the second character and help overcome the many obstacles waiting ahead - mostly in form of several different kinds of separatist droids. While the players can use their lightsaber or blaster to fend them off, the Jedi characters also have the ability to ride the droids by jumping onto them from behind. This is not only useful to blast through enemy lines but is also used to solve specific riddles preventing the characters from moving on. In addition the droids can be forced to dance with every other droid on the screen following his lead making them defenseless. These dances are unique for each droid and need to be bought first in the shop. Also available there: funny masks and combat upgrades like stronger blasters or a more powerful force-push.

To buy these things, the players have to unlock them first and then need to invest points which are gained by killing enemies as well as by successfully completing missions or the mini-games. These mini-games are scattered around the levels and turn up once a specific section has been completed. They mostly involve killing as many enemies as possible in a short amount of time. Each kill in succession both during normal gameplay and the mini-games also ranks up the multiplier adding even more points to the account. Once a player dies, he will respawn at the nearest checkpoint either immediately if he plays alone or after the second player has reached one - both times without any penalties.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars Battlefront : Elite Squadron</name>
		<desc>Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron is a third-person shooter video game, part of the Star Wars: Battlefront series released November 3, 2009 on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable.

Gameplay
Elite Squadron allows players to participate in combat on foot, in ground vehicles or in space. Players are also able to enter capital ships and, once the shields are down, fight the enemy inside on foot. The ground-space transitions are accompanied by short cutscenes while the game loads the next area. The same is also true of entering or exiting a capital ship. This is the first Battlefront game to allow players to fly from ground to space battles. The consequences of each battle will depend on the players actions, meaning that each individual enemy killed can affect the outcome of a result. The battlefront will not be one giant, seamless map, but a compilation of inter-connected, smaller size areas, each one capable of affecting the other.

Elite Squadron features "Heroes and Villains" gameplay.
It includes playable characters such as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Darth Vader, Darth Maul, The Emperor and Kit Fisto, and the Heroes and Villains mode (Assault Mode) last featured in Star Wars: Battlefront II. Pre-release screenshots also show that General Rahm Kota, a character from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is playable, as well as other characters from Renegade Squadron, such as Col Serra. The Heroes and Villains mode is displayed quite conveniently after a demo had been released on the PlayStation Network. Other game modes have been implied, with a focus on multiplayer, such as a deathmatch mode. Also, the Galactic Conquest mode, has undergone an enhancement on the PSP. In Galactic Conquest, two players are able to share a single PSP, and compete against each other in a strategy based game mode. PSP Players are able to mix elements from the Star Wars saga and put them into locations and situations that never happened, allowing for full customization. The story mode has been called "a huge step up from previous story modes", and was praised for incorporating the controls into the mission. It was also revealed that making progress in the story, and completing objectives, was the way to unlock customization props.</desc>

Players take part in a futuristic racing league known as the FX300 Racing League and control a fast hovercrafts on tight, cornering tracks, vying for first place in one of many tournaments. There are ten anti-gravity vehicles available to use (two need to be unlocked), each with their own characteristics in speed, handling and acceleration. Vehicles are further divided into classes that are unlocked gradually. In later classes most of the vehicles become much faster and require more precise steering at fast speeds. In the same vein, players can unlock new tournaments.

There are a total of sixteen tracks to race on: twelve designed from the ground up for the PSP, as well as four classic Wipeout tracks. Each track has its own obstacles, as well as weapon pick-ups (both offensive and defensive) and speed boosters. The different game modes include single races, tournaments of sets of races, time trial and zone races. In the zone races the player goes through a number of increasingly difficult zones on his own without the ability to slow down until the vehicle explodes because of collision damage. New game elements are unlocked through the Tournament mode.

The game features wireless play over ad-hoc mode (PSP-to-PSP). It was also the first PSP game to support downloadable content with extra teams, tracks and PSP skins. Some of these packs are only available for specific regional versions. The European version of the game supports game sharing.</desc>

Featuring a roster of 37 characters, including 3 (Maki, Yun, Eagle) never seen outside of the GBA version, and 1 brand-new character (Ingrid) to the game, all with their own storyline, you can spend a very long time learning the intricacies of all the fighters.

To help avoid the typical repetitiveness of the game, all the modes available in the previous home versions of Alpha 3, such as Arcade Mode, Training Mode, Edit Mode, World Tour, Dramatic Battle and Survival modes are all available in this version, along with the brand-new 100-man kumite (survival) and tag-team battle modes.

The PSP version also has network games (Ad-Hoc only) for up to 8 players, with four additional modes: VS Mode, Team Mode, Variable Battle (take three players into battle of which you control two, and the computer one), and the Dramatic Battle with multiple fighters going at it simultaneously.</desc>

		<name>Super Monkey Ball Adventure</name>
		<desc>Our four heroes from Super Monkey Ball - Aiai, Meemee, Baby and Gongon - were enjoying a typical day, when they saw a flying machine crash down on a nearby island.  Soon, they discovered that the mysterious Naysayers have appeared, spreading discord and unhappiness all over the island.  And to top it all off, the prince and princess of the neighboring islands have gone missing on Jungle Island - if they aren't found and returned, there's sure to be trouble!  Can our heroes restore order to Monearth?

Super Monkey Ball Adventure takes the monkey rolling madness of the previous games and puts a story-based spin on it.  Choosing from one of the four monkeys, Players roll their way around the various islands of Monearth, talking to citizens and performing the tasks they request (such as delivering sandwiches, finding a missing baby, rescuing rare flowers, and more) to cheer them up.

Certain parts of the island are locked by 'Puzzle Gates' - these can only be unlocked by solving the puzzle stages which can be accessed in front of the gate.  Each pad transports you to a different Puzzle Realm.  The Puzzle Realm stages are the more familiar gameplay of Super Monkey Ball - simple looking stages where players must carefully (but quickly) roll their monkey to the finish line within the time limit.

Bananas can also be collected throughout the game - these are used as currency, and can be used to unlock new playable characters and puzzle stages.  They can also be given to particular unhappy citizens.  The monkeys will also learn magical chants as they progress through the game - these allow you to climb walls, set your monkey's ball on fire, use a boxing glove to attack, and more.

Also included in Super Monkey Ball Adventure are the famous Party Games - favorites like Monkey Race, Monkey Target and Monkey fight return.  There's also three new games: 'Monkey Cannon' - fire monkeys at enemy towers to steal their bricks for your own tower.  'Monkey Bounce' - bounce on a trampoline-like platform with your opponents, and try to claim as many squares as possible.  'Monkey Tag' - roll around a globe and try to collect as many balloons as possible.</desc>

Although the residents of the planet are unaware, this is actually a result of the actions of two entities named Widdershin and Aurora, the descenders of other worlds. As a last resort, the world's life-giving tree (the World Tree) uses the last of its power to create a defender - the player's own character. The hero, after being awakened by a strange creature named Mormo whose own world was destroyed by the same threat, learns of the danger to this world's World Tree. Upon hearing a scream, the player rushes to discover that a girl is being attacked by a soldier. After rescuing the girl, she introduces herself as Kannono, a member of an organization named Ad Libitum. This guild seeks to help the people of the world, fighting injustice and oppression. With no better leads, the player and Mormo set out to join Ad Libitum, hoping to learn more about the location of the devourer.</desc>

		<name>Test Drive Unlimited</name>
		<desc>Test Drive Unlimited lets the player choose one of several characters, both male and female, waiting at an airport to check in for their flight to the Caribbean dream island O'ahu located in Hawaii. The characters do not have different statistics, that only applies to the extravagant, licensed cars.

The whole island is accessible from the beginning and after the player has bought his first home and car, he can either drive around and look for events or load up the map and jump directly to a location of a race, a car salesman or other locations - similar to Need for Speed Underground. Every bought car has a built-in navigation system, guided by a woman's voice to get the player to his destination, either pre-programmed in the game or decided by the player.

There are over 125 different cars and motorcycles in different price ranges to choose from. From the Audi TT over the Jaguar XJ200 to the McLaren F1 and Kawasaki Z1000, there is everything the character needs as a young man or girl with too much money on their hands. Each car has its own, realistic set of characteristics such as speed or handling, but they all have a highly detailed exterior and interior in common.

The character starts with $200.000 dollars in his pocket, but there will not be anything left after buying a first car and home. Additional cash needs to be earned in different kinds of races from checkpoint challenges to time trials. The money cannot only be used to buy new homes and new cars (and a little tuning for those), but also to buy new outfits for the avatar.

The heart of Test Drive Unlimited is the online mode. Using a GameSpy account, players connect to the official TDU server immediately after loading the game. New options become available online, such as a meeting lounge where the statistics and looks of other players can be looked up. It also provides access to player-created matches shown on the map screen. Creating a race  here also works in the singleplayer modes. At any location, the start and finish can be defined, as well as the type of the race, which type/classes of cars or bikes are allowed and how many people can participate. If not all slots have been filled up by other players, the AI will take control of the rest.

The PSP and PS2 versions have a lower visual quality and lack a few features, such as manual transmission, avatar customization, certain cars and all motorcycles, dealership and tuning shop NPCs, the vehicle interior camera angle and certain missions. They do include Master Points and Auto GPS, and certain default vehicles only available for the 360 version through download packs.</desc>

Uncle Mortimer returns to aid you with his brand new Woah Coaster pieces which allow the player to build coasters with massive jumps, ring or fire and spinning blades into their coaster.

The main plot line is that Globo-Joy, the rival park owners and main antagonist from the first game, are trying to destroy the good name of Thrillville by putting saboteurs in your park.

The only way to solve the mystery is to help solve your guests' problems by building new rides and coasters or beat challengers to your games.</desc>

		<name>Thrillville : Off the Rails</name>
		<desc>The game is played in third person where the player is presented by an avatar chosen from a roster of young adults as well as children, each with their own voice and personality. Navigating your avatar through each of the five themeparks, you will have to complete various tasks represented through an in-game menu split into six categories, such as building coaster rides, hiring publicity and looking at the visitors needs. The game features a robust sim-like economy within the park, where the player has to manage prices, fund the research for new rides and make sure there is enough power to around for all the stalls and rides. The rollercoaster editor is similar to that of the Roller Coaster Tycoon series, but all coasters have to start in assigned areas. Progression is made by completing missions that either requires you to build themepark rides, befriend visitors, root out robot invaders, bribe journalists, train personale and play lots &amp; lots of minigames. As each collectable found and mission completed, the player gains experience, called Thrill Points that will allow him to increase in level, and open new themeparks to buy and build up as he pleases. In addition to the single-player there is a separate multiplayer mini-game section, as well as Main Menu section dedicated to coasters that can be created and saved to be used in the game.

There is over fourty minigames to be played in this version of Thrillville, and Off the Rails adds the ability for rollercoasters to crash, adding more minigames, more options and expands the interaction between the player and the visitors.</desc>

You blew through some of the fiercest opponents; taking down AJ Styles, devastating Robert Roode, and destroying Booker T., but then... everything changed. The politics behind the ring got heated, and not in your favor. When you finally claimed the title, someone came for you. And now you're here. You've woken up in what appears to be a rundown hospital in Mexico, and you can't remember a thing; your name, what you do, and certainly not why you're here. Lost in a land that is not your own, you need to get back to America. You hear talk of a local wrestling match where the winner goes on to wrestle at a nearby American Air Force base. This is the best shot you've got at getting home. But once you're in the ring, something strange happens. Your body seems to remember what your mind cannot. Punches, grapples, throws, and stomps all come naturally, as if you were a seasoned professional... This is where your journey begins. Find your way home, remember who you were, and claim what was rightfully yours.</desc>

The gameplay is similar to Pikmin for the Gamecube, the player controls the Tokobots by highlighting them and sending them to certain areas and complete certain tasks.  The game will start you out with six, but as the levels progress, more Tokobots will be available, the more that can be obtained, the more bigger and powerful machines that can be used.

		<desc>In Tony Hawk's Project 8, The Birdman is out looking for the top 8 skaters for his new Project and it happens that he has stopped in your city to search for the best top skaters. It is up to you to prove that you can make the cut among the 200 other people varying for the coveted 8 spots. You are start out ranked 200th with various goals set for you throughout the city including the return of classic mode from the early Tony Hawk games. 

Chances to rank up come in various different ways now. There are spray painted lines located throughout the city to mark a type of goal. Weather it is grinding a certain distance, completing Natas spins, keeping your balance while doing a manual for a certain time and distance, point combos, and trick combos. Also players can obtain missions via random strangers located throughout the city.

Players can also earn Stokens by performing tricks to impress the locals that can be found wandering around the city. Players can use these Stokens to buy additional clothing, haircut styles, shoes, tricks, and boards from the store.

New to this game is the slow motion "Nail the Trick" mode where the focus is placed on the skater's feet and the movement of the board can be controlled with both of the analog sticks to build up a huge combo score!

The PSP version includes 14 multiplayer modes and 8 classic levels including Hawaii, Alcatraz and The Mall. The PS2, PS3 and Xbox version do not support online multiplayer.</desc>

		<name>Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen</name>
		<desc>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power.

The game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron.

Though the game doesnâ€™t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.

For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a "Remote Weapon System", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.</desc>

		<desc>Transformers: The Game is the name of multiple versions of a video game based on the 2007 live action film Transformers, all of which were released in North America in June 2007. Home console and PC versions were developed by Traveller's Tales for the PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3 and PC. A different PlayStation Portable version was developed by Savage Entertainment.

Transformers Autobots and Transformers Decepticons are the Nintendo DS versions of Transfomers: The Game. Vicarious Visions, who was tasked with bringing the adaptation to the Nintendo DS, chose to adapt the DS version into two separate games.[1] Autobots follows the heroes' perspective while Decepticons follows the villains'. Unlike games with multiple SKUs such as PokÃ©mon which feature only minor differences between versions, these are two separate games, sharing some basic similarities, but with unique characters, missions and locations.[2]</desc>

Every so often new rows of blocks will push up the current ones. Not clearing enough within a set time limit will force the blocks to the top of the screen, where the player will lose. Blocks can be cleared if at least four blocks of the same color are touching. The speed of new rows will increase as the game is played longer. The blocks which get cleared will result in the blocks above falling down. The game offers several different modes including a multiplayer and arcade mode. Games in the franchise have been released for the arcade, PSP, and mobile phone (EZweb, Yahoo! Keitai (Yahoo!ã‚±ãƒ¼ã‚¿ã‚¤)). A second PSP Kollon game, titled Korokoro Kollon (ã‚³ãƒ­ã‚³ãƒ­ã“ã‚ã‚“) was released in Japan on June 22, 2006.</desc>

		<desc>Set in the middle ages, Undead Knights is a story about a puppet king, his mysterious queen, and a murderous betrayal.  The king ordered his men to slay the entire family of his loyal knight, Romulus, after Romulus questions the loyalty of the queen.

You play as one of three characters; the Knight Romulus, his younger brother Remus, or Sylvia, Remus' bride and daughter to the king.  As the three lay dying, they make a pact with an evil force, and return infused with unholy power, bent on revenge.

As they make their way to the king, players must convert foes into zombie slaves. These zombies may be ordered to attack or pin down your opponents, break down barrier/objects, and even form unliving bridges to circumvent obstacles.  Zombie minions may also be utilized as inhuman shields, objects to be thrown, and more.

The game features a metal soundtrack, third person viewpoint, and gameplay similar to that of Tecmo's 3D Ninja Gaiden games.  Players will collect "Dark Energy" along the way, which can be spent on character upgrades.  In addition to the single player story mode, Undead Knights has ad-hoc multiplayer support for up to four players.</desc>

		<desc>The game's story takes place two years following the conclusion of Valkyria Chronicles, in which Squad 7 defeats Maximillian in Gallia and destroys the Marmota, ending the Second Europan War. A rebel group of dissatisfied aristocrats and like-minded soldiers and citizens calling themselves the Gallian Revolutionary Army begins a civil war to wage an ethnic cleansing campaign against Gallians of Darcsen descent.[11] However, with the intense fight against the Empire having left Gallia's regular army in an exhausted state, there is initially little to stop the insurrection from gaining momentum. Laws preventing the formation of a national militia to fight fellow Gallians force the government to deploy military academy cadets to the front lines in order to combat and defeat the GRA forces.</desc>

With the end of the world approaching, Odin, Lord of Asgard, summons Lenneth Valkyrie to his side. Possessing the ability to hear the thoughts and feelings of men and women in their dying moments, he charges Valkyrie to search Midgard, the world of mortals, to recruit and train the souls of worthy warriors to join the ranks of the Aesir in the Sacred War.

		<name>Viewtiful Joe : Red Hot Rumble</name>
		<desc>This game is different from the previous incarnations, whereas this one takes its gameplay from the Super Smash Bros. series. The game features the main heroes, Joe, Capt. Blue and Silvia, along with many others as well as a group of villains fighting each other in a series of battles in multiple environments, such as a construction site, a warehouse and a wrestling ring to name a few.

The story has Captain Blue getting ready to shoot a new movie, but has trouble deciding who will be the lead character, so he sets up a tournament of the heroes to determine it. The player takes control of one of the three heroes, battling a set of enemies, each stage having their own set objectives to complete in order to advance. There is also a party mode that can support up to four-different players in an all out brawl. Players can collect "VFX Orbs" throughout the fight, collecting enough will allow the player to use a VFX power on the opponent(s).

The PSP port is virtually the same same, but with added content exclusive to it, a single player Trial Mode, where the player competes in a series of mini-games, the ability to play as Dante from the Devil May Cry series and a game sharing feature that lets players play wirelessly using Ad-Hoc and play certain stages using only one disc.</desc>

		<desc>Virtua Tennis 3 features 20 international tennis stars like Roger Federer, Lindsay Davenport or Maria Sharapova against which you need to compete in the heart of the game: The World Tour. You create your own character and play to reach the number one rank on the world ranking list.

Virtua Tennis 3 is not a simulation like Top Spin 2 and only needs three buttons to perform all possible shot. Still time needs to be invested in training the character through several mini-games in which need you to hit a circle on the other side of the net or defeat aliens by hitting them with returns.

You can also play as one of the professionals against the CPU or a friend (or two if you play a Double). True to the series of the home version, there are also 12 mini-games available to play against your friends. These include the ones from the World Tour training as well as different ones like Curling or Super-Bingo. The Tournament Mode and Exhibition Mode are also present in the arcade version, but the Challenge Mode has been replaced by the World Tour Mode and Party Mode.</desc>

A total of 79 playable characters from Dynasty Warriors 5, Samurai Warriors 2 and two new combatants are available to you.  The new Weapon Fusion technique allows you to combine a particular character's different weapons into a single stronger one.

Choose from four unrelated story campaigns, Shu, Wei, Wu, and Samurai Warriors Story, with different unlockable characters, weapons and items in each.  In the game's Free Mode, you can use any character in any stage you've already completed.

		<name>The Warriors</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1979 Paramount Pictures film of the same name and voiced by most of the original cast, The Warriors follows the career of a Coney Island street gang.  Starting months before the events of the film, The Warriors expand and defend their Coney Island turf, while proving that they are heavy enough players to join The Riffs’ network.  With a citywide rep, they can get invited to a major gang meeting where the future of New York street crime will be decided.  

The game follows the nine lead members of The Warriors (with flashback missions showing how they came to The Warriors): leader Cleon, Swan, Ajax, Cowboy, Cochise, Snow, Fox, Rembrandt, and Vermin.  During the game, the player will control each member, usually acting as a war chief and leading a squad of Warriors on a mission.  Missions vary from simply wrecking another crew to completing a series of objectives while avoiding arrest or worse. 

During missions, players can mug pedestrians, steal car radios, commit smash and grabs, tag walls or bomb other gangs’ burners, and load up on flash.  Between each story based mission, The Warriors return to their Coney Island hangout where they can train to improve their stats, go out on patrol, review their accomplishments, replay levels, or enter into a series of quick-play combat matches.  

The game plays like a squad-based brawler.  Each Warrior has his own fighting style and much of the game environment can be weaponized.  Fights are fast and often brutal, but stealth is also an option.  Players can perform stealthy finishing moves and distract police or other gang members with thrown bottles.  The game’s environments are fully 3D allowing Warriors to escape along the rooftops, hop over fences, or dash into shadowy areas.</desc>

		<desc>Become the God of Destruction! Build a thriving natural ecosystem, a twisting, tunneling dungeon underneath the earth, and fill it with hordes of terrible monsters to protect the evil overlord, Badman. Ensure that he is safe from armies of nasty humans, eager to ransack the place, steal your loot, and prevent Badman from taking over the world!

Holy Invasion of Privacy, Badman! is a strategy game in the vein of the Bullfrog game, Dungeon Keeper. Players use their pickaxe to dig deep into the earth to protect the villain, Badman, from harm. Their goal is to create monsters by digging up nutrient-filled blocks, which produce monsters. The more nutrients inside the block, the more powerful the monster is. By creating all sorts of powerful monsters, you'll increase your 'Battle Power', which indicates how powerful Badman's entire army is.

Players only have a limited amount of 'Dig Power' available. After this runs out, they cannot dig through the earth any more, and must rely on the monsters to take care of the dungeon. More Dig Power can be earned for each level by not using all the Dig Power you were given, or by earning bonus Dig Power at the end of the level.</desc>

		<name>WipEout Pulse</name>
		<desc>WipEout Pulse is the second game in the WipEout series to be released on the PSP. Just like the other titles in the series, it is a futuristic racing games where players control a hovercraft-like vehicle that hovers above the ground and can reach very high speeds. The game is set in 2207 where players take part in the FX400 Anti-Gravity Racing League with courses all over the world.

The vehicles are divided over different teams (twelve including downloads), each with their own characteristics based on handling, speed, acceleration and more. While racing, moving over pads provides boosts or both offensive and defensive power-ups such as shields, rockets, a wall of fire, autopilot, a gun or a turbo boost. Instead of using weapons, they can now also be absorbed to restore the energy levels. A single button is used to accelerate, with regular steering and also air brakes for sharp corners. The visuals are very fast and the soundtrack consists of mostly electronic tracks, a hallmark of the series.

The base game consists of twelve tracks, but these can be driven in both directions (designated by black or white in the title name). New to the track design are waterfall-like drops, loops and corkscrews. At certain section the vehicle is glued to the track to pass these. Entirely new to the series is the revamped progression system. As usual, new tracks and faster models need to be unlocked by winning races, but instead of a linear model these are now grouped as hexagon-clustered grids with different modes of play. When available, players can choose any of the sections to participate in a time trial, single race, head-to-head, eliminator games (returning from Wipeout 3) and Zone games (introduced in WipEout Fusion) where the vehicle constantly accelerates and transforms into faster models until all health is depleted. A certain amount of races need to be won to access a new grid, but using this system some difficult races can be avoided or ignored. In all races the vehicles are destroyed when all energy is depleted. Based on the performance a bronze, silver or gold medal is awarded and there are three difficulty settings.

Using the vehicle of a certain team regularly is awarded with a loyalty system. The game supports game sharing and multiplayer modes using both Ad Hoc and Infrastructure as access. Up to 30 mp3 files can be loaded on a memory stick to use as the in-game soundtrack, there is photo mode to take screenshots during replays and on the game's official website players can design their own car skins using a flash client to use in the game. As with the previous games, there are many expansion packs that introduce new teams and tracks.</desc>

		<desc>WipEout Pure is the first adaptation for the PSP of the long-running Wipeout series. Players take part in a futuristic racing league known as the FX300 Racing League and control a fast hovercrafts on tight, cornering tracks, vying for first place in one of many tournaments. There are ten anti-gravity vehicles available to use (two need to be unlocked), each with their own characteristics in speed, handling and acceleration. Vehicles are further divided into classes that are unlocked gradually. In later classes most of the vehicles become much faster and require more precise steering at fast speeds. In the same vein, players can unlock new tournaments.

There are a total of sixteen tracks to race on: twelve designed from the ground up for the PSP, as well as four classic Wipeout tracks. Each track has its own obstacles, as well as weapon pick-ups (both offensive and defensive) and speed boosters. The different game modes include single races, tournaments of sets of races, time trial and zone races. In the zone races the player goes through a number of increasingly difficult zones on his own without the ability to slow down until the vehicle explodes because of collision damage. New game elements are unlocked through the Tournament mode.

The game features wireless play over ad-hoc mode (PSP-to-PSP). It was also the first PSP game to support downloadable content with extra teams, tracks and PSP skins. Some of these packs are only available for specific regional versions. The European version of the game supports game sharing.</desc>

		<name>Worms : Open Warfare</name>
		<desc>Worms: Open Warfare is an artillery strategy game.[2] It was developed by Team17 and published by THQ for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS.[1] There are several other Worms video games in the Worms series. The game marked Team17's return to its 2D roots.[2] The game spawned a sequel, Worms: Open Warfare 2, which is also available on Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable.

In Worms: Open Warfare, the player takes control of an army of worms. The goal of the game is to defeat the opposing army through reducing the health points of enemy worms using various types of weaponry while avoiding friendly fire and other obstacles. The weapons and gadgets you use in battle include grenades, homing missiles, bazookas, cluster bombs, banana bombs (a Worms staple), dynamite, air strikes, shotguns, and many more. You can also choose from a variety of settings to battle in and make your own schemes and teams.
The game is played in rounds with each worm starting with 100 hit points. Each team takes turns controlling one of their worms. The player is usually allocated 60 seconds per turn to move their worm around the battlefield and attack the opponent worms, though this time limit is customisable when playing non-career games. Only one attack is allowed per turn.
In addition to timing individual player turns, each round has a 20-minute time limit. If the round timer runs down to 0:00 before a team claims victory, every worm's HP drops to 1, creating a sudden death scenario. During the course of a round, crates containing health or weapons will occasionally drop and the water level will rise.</desc>

		<name>Worms : Open Warfare 2</name>
		<desc>Worms: Open Warfare 2 is an artillery and strategy video game and the ninth installment in the Worms series. It was developed by Team17 and Two Tribes, and published by THQ for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS in 2007. It is the sequel to Worms: Open Warfare.

The gameplay of Open Warfare 2 is similar to that of previous games in the series. The game is viewed from a side-scrolling perspective. The player takes control of a team of several worms, and is pitted against other teams of worms under the control of AI (if in Singleplayer) or another Human (if in Multiplayer). Actions are performed in time-limited turns that cycle through each team. The winning team is that which can kill the opposing teams' worms; this can be achieved by using various types of weaponry and tools, availability of which depends on the game mode being played. Battles takes place on randomized, destructible terrain, which are visually distinguished by themes; "Forts" mode takes place on two forts, whose terrain depends on the theme. The player is able to select victory dances and color schemes for their worms, and to make custom race courses or fort maps using the level editor.

The PSP version allows players to select hats for their worms, while the DS version includes some exclusive minigames via the "Laboratory" mode. A demo of the game has been released by download for the PlayStation Portable, and for the Nintendo DS via DS Download Station Vol. 7.</desc>

		<name>WRC : FIA World Rally Championship</name>
		<desc>FIA licensed World Rally Championship game including the 2005 season teams, drivers, cars, and rally locations. The player controls the car on the track and tries to complete the stages in fastest possible time.  Since rally is driven so that the track is clear of other cars, competitors are shown as ghost cars.  Co-drivers notes are both spoken and shown on the screen to aid in navigating the often twisty stages.

Game can be played in Quick Rally, Time Trial, Single Rally, Championship, and Multiplayer modes. Quick Rally selects a random car and rally stage to race.  In Time Trial, a ghost car is shown on the track and the player's goal is to beat its time on that stage.  In Single Rally mode, player chooses the team and car to drive with and needs to complete all the stages in a single rally.  Other drivers are shown as ghost cars.

Championship mode extends the Single Rally mode into full season of 16 rallies.  Each rally has two to four stages and the player must reach certain position in order to advance to the next stage.  Difficulty level (novice, professional, expert, extreme) defines the number of stages per rally and the required finishing position.  Expert and extreme levels are unlocked by completing the preceding level.  After each rally, points are awarded to top 8 drivers and the championship is won by most points at the end of the season.  Completing championship modes also unlocks new car types and rally stages for other play modes.

Multiplayer modes include both offline (hot-seat) and online play.  The hot-seat rallies are for up to four players and allow the players to compete in Time Trial, Single Rally, and Championship modes.  Online wireless play allows up to eight players to race together on a single stage.  As in other modes, competitors are shown as ghost cars.

The game has an arcade-style control scheme (no manual gear changes for example) and a simple damage model.  Damaging the car has visual impact on the car and on expert and extreme levels, damage affects the car performance too.  PSP WRC supports downloadable content, like custom avatars for the player.</desc>

		<name>X-Men Legends II : Rise of Apocalypse</name>
		<desc>X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse is an action role-playing game developed primarily by Raven Software and published by Activision. It is the follow up to 2004's X-Men Legends. It was first released in September 2005 for the GameCube, Microsoft Windows, N-Gage, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Xbox video game platforms. It is set after the events of X-Men Legends and features the mutant supervillain Apocalypse as the primary antagonist.

The developers intended the game to have a greater sense of scale than its predecessor, and writers created a story where the villains known as the Brotherhood of Mutants would need to ally themselves with the heroic X-Men to defeat a greater threat. High quality cinematics were created by Blur Studio. Online multiplayer was also added.

The game was well received by gaming critics on all platforms. Critics felt that the inclusion of online play, additional mutant powers, and a larger cast made the game an improvement over its predecessor. Some reviewers were critical of the game's voice acting and felt that the gameplay was repetitive. It sold enough copies to be added to the budget line known as PlayStation 2's Greatest Hits.</desc>

		<name>Xiaolin Showdown</name>
		<desc>Xiaolin Showdown is a game based on the animated series of the same name from Warner. It is a fighting game where you play as the four main characters of the show (Kimiko, Omi, Raimundo and Clay). Even if you play alone (the game supports 4 simultaneous players in story mode), the other 3 are present, controlled by the computer. You can also unlock 2 additional characters: Jack Spicer and Chase Young.

The players must defeat waves of enemy robots to collect Shen Gong Wu artifacts to increase their power and defeat series of enemies, until they are able to face Mala Mala Jong and put an end on the plans of the evil boy genius, Jack Spicer. Each Shen Gong Wu provides a new power, like locking nearby characters or punching the ground for area damage. Additional Shen Gong Wu can be bought using coins collected during the game.

The gameplay is inspired by party fighting games, like Power Stone and Super Smash Bros. You can chain combos with button combinations, jump and give flying kicks.

Between the game levels, there are showdowns, where the characters have to bet a Shen Gong Wu. The one that wins the challenge chooses a Shen Gong Wu from the player who lost. You can also only play the showdowns, instead the full story mode.</desc>

		<desc>The game primarily uses the same gameplay mechanics from the original game albeit with several changes. Most notable of which is that the game now uses the D-pad (arrow buttons) and a "hold and release" function for the face buttons in addition to the normal gameplay. Similar to the symbols of the first game, the game now includes colored arrows for example a blue arrow pointing downwards, this indicates that the player has to press "down" on the D-Pad and the "Cross" face button at the same time. The game also add a fourth difficulty, Extreme, to songs that is more difficult than the hard difficulty in the first game. The game will also introduce duets, as compared to only having solo songs in the first game, thus allowing players to select two modules instead. This also carries on into the Edit Mode of the game allowing players to create PVs for duets with two modules in them.</desc>
