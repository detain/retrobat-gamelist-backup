		<desc>Aldynes: The Mission Code for Rage Crisis, is a Japanese horizontal scrolling shoot 'em up game developed by Produce for the SuperGrafx. The game has a unique option-based combat and features levels with large scaling and parallax scrolling effects. 

Nearing the year 2020, the societies of mankind fall into global depression just as an alien invasion suddenly descends on Earth. The aliens come from a large mechanical planetoid and attack Earth without reason or communication. With all defenses annihilated, the United Nations and NASA create a powerful space fighter known as The Ortega under project name Aldynes.

The player mans a space ship, including a radar which shows enemies, and the goal is to reach the end of each level where an end boss waits. As usually, the main occupation is to blast a lot of aliens which approach the player. The available weapons are bombs and a machine gun, both unlimited. Getting hit is a bad idea because it results in death. The player has three lives which can be raised by scoring 20000 points.</desc>

		<desc>Madouou Granzort is a platform/action game that consists of seven zones each guarded by a boss.
You will cross ruins, underground, a forest or any futuristic complex by laminating robots of various forms.
You will make your character jump by pressing the I button and hit him by pressing the II button. It is the Select button that pauses the game, as Run is used to switch heroes. At any time you can switch from the red knight to the green, then to the blue and so on.</desc>
