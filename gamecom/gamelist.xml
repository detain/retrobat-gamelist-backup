		<name>Centipede</name>
		<desc>Centipede for the Game.Com is an updated version of the classic arcade game. Besides an adaptation of the original game, the cartridge also includes an updated mode with higher resolution graphics and increased difficulty. Up to four players can play taking turns.

Gameplay is unchanged from the original. The player controls a figure at the bottom of the screen that has to shoot at insects, including spiders, fleas and scorpions, and most importantly, a centipede that moves horizontally and moves closer towards the bottom of the screen when hitting an obstacle. When hit by a shot, the centipede splits into two separate sections.

Game options include selectable difficulty, number of lives and movement speed. The start level can also be chosen. There is also an option to flip the screen so the game can be played with d-pad and buttons reversed from the standard.</desc>

		<name>Duke Nukem 3d</name>
		<desc>The Game.Com version of Duke Nukem 3D plays more like a dungeon crawler rather than an FPS due to Game.Com's hardware limitations. The player can only move Duke forward, backwards, strafe left or right, one screen at a time. By pressing B or C the player can turn Duke to shoot left or right, but can't turn him to face that direction and move.

The game is divided in three episodes (L.A. Meltdown, Lunar Apocalypse and Shrapnel City) comprised of a total of twelve missions loosely based on the original ones of the same name, which can be accessed via passwords (given after the player dies). There are four weapons available (boot, pistol, shotgun and RPG) and four different kinds of enemies: Assault Troops, Pig Cops, Enforcers and Octobrains. Items like armor and key cards can be collected, as well as med kits and ammunition. There are four difficulty levels and the game also features Duke's digitized one-liners and other speech.</desc>

		<desc>Poor Frog. He just wants to get home safe but must first cross a road and a river full of dangers.

The Game.com version of Frogger has two versions on the cartridge. The classic version is like the original arcade game: guide five frogs, one at a time, across a busy street and a river to the safety of his home. The second version is an updated version that contains newer levels. Some are nothing but two areas of river or road and others are one big area of road with no safe area in the middle. The Game.com also has up to four players, playing in turn.</desc>

		<desc>You are holding in your hands the most addictive,brain boggling puzzle ever created. The object of thepuzzle is simple...turn the LIGHTS OUT. It seems soeasy...at first. The problem is that every press of abutton has an effect on the puzzle. Lights that are onwill shut off, and “off” lights will turn on. (So, if youtouch a button that is lit, it will shut off. Conversely,touching an unlit button will cause it to light up).Moreover, when you touch a button, it not onlychanges that light, but it also changes the adjacentlights (those that are directly above, below, or next tothe  pressed  button).  Every  pre-programmed  puzzlehas a solution. Your goal is to solve each puzzle inthe  fewest  number  of  “moves”,  or  steps.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the electronic game that was made by Tiger, Quiz Wiz: Cyber Trivia challenges up to three players to answer a series of questions in five categories: Sports, Famous People, Film and TV, Potpourri, and General Knowledge. In addition to the five categories, the player can choose from five lengths of game, from five up to thirty questions, and can also choose to be timed when answering a question (from 5 up to 20 seconds). In the game, the player(s) uses the stylus to answer the questions, either by directly touching the answer or touching the letter corresponding to his/her choice. Each answer is met by a word from your Quiz Wiz host, the Wise Guy, whether correct or incorrect (which you can turn off in Options). After the chosen amount of questions have elapsed, the game is over and players' scores are displayed.</desc>

This version has the player control Leon by positioning him in the direction he needs to go and by having him move forward whilst engaging zombies. Leon can only be moved over three horizontal planes as in a 2D game with a side view, but with a pseudo 3D effect. Each non-scrolling location holds different zombies and once they are dead Leon moves to a new screen. He has access to an inventory to cycle between weapons. There is support for options such as touchscreen inventory menus, in addition to the game keeping track of the time the player has spent with the game.</desc>

		<desc>Scrabble for the Game.Com is an adaptation of the popular word construction board game.

The game can be played by two to four players, either on the same handheld, via compete.com cable, or against CPU opponents (with three difficulty settings available). Options include the toggling of the tournament timer and penalty timer and sort order of tiles on the rack.

During a game, the board is seen from the top with player scores at the right and the tile rack at the bottom. The game starts with the full board in view, but two zoom settings are available to check out the details and to place tiles via touch interface. When playing against human opponents, it is possible to challenge their constructed words. This is not possible against CPU opponents, who check their words against a built-in dictionary.</desc>

		<name>Centipede</name>
		<desc>Centipede for the Game.Com is an updated version of the classic arcade game. Besides an adaptation of the original game, the cartridge also includes an updated mode with higher resolution graphics and increased difficulty. Up to four players can play taking turns.

Gameplay is unchanged from the original. The player controls a figure at the bottom of the screen that has to shoot at insects, including spiders, fleas and scorpions, and most importantly, a centipede that moves horizontally and moves closer towards the bottom of the screen when hitting an obstacle. When hit by a shot, the centipede splits into two separate sections.

Game options include selectable difficulty, number of lives and movement speed. The start level can also be chosen. There is also an option to flip the screen so the game can be played with d-pad and buttons reversed from the standard.</desc>

		<name>Duke Nukem 3d</name>
		<desc>The Game.Com version of Duke Nukem 3D plays more like a dungeon crawler rather than an FPS due to Game.Com's hardware limitations. The player can only move Duke forward, backwards, strafe left or right, one screen at a time. By pressing B or C the player can turn Duke to shoot left or right, but can't turn him to face that direction and move.

The game is divided in three episodes (L.A. Meltdown, Lunar Apocalypse and Shrapnel City) comprised of a total of twelve missions loosely based on the original ones of the same name, which can be accessed via passwords (given after the player dies). There are four weapons available (boot, pistol, shotgun and RPG) and four different kinds of enemies: Assault Troops, Pig Cops, Enforcers and Octobrains. Items like armor and key cards can be collected, as well as med kits and ammunition. There are four difficulty levels and the game also features Duke's digitized one-liners and other speech.</desc>

The Game.com version of Frogger has two versions on the cartridge. The classic version is like the original arcade game: guide five frogs, one at a time, across a busy street and a river to the safety of his home. The second version is an updated version that contains newer levels. Some are nothing but two areas of river or road and others are one big area of road with no safe area in the middle.

The problem is that every press of abutton has an effect on the puzzle. Lights that are onwill shut off, and “off” lights will turn on. (So, if youtouch a button that is lit, it will shut off. Conversely,touching an unlit button will cause it to light up).Moreover, when you touch a button, it not onlychanges that light, but it also changes the adjacentlights (those that are directly above, below, or next tothe  pressed  button).  Every  pre-programmed  puzzlehas a solution. Your goal is to solve each puzzle inthe  fewest  number  of  “moves”,  or  steps.</desc>

The game can be played by two to four players, either on the same handheld, via compete.com cable, or against CPU opponents (with three difficulty settings available). Options include the toggling of the tournament timer and penalty timer and sort order of tiles on the rack.

During a game, the board is seen from the top with player scores at the right and the tile rack at the bottom. The game starts with the full board in view, but two zoom settings are available to check out the details and to place tiles via touch interface. When playing against human opponents, it is possible to challenge their constructed words. This is not possible against CPU opponents, who check their words against a built-in dictionary.</desc>

		<name>Wheel Of Fortune</name>
		<desc>Wheel of Fortune for Game.Com is an adaptation of the popular TV game show where contestants spin the wheel to win money and have to guess letters in a puzzle.

The game can be played by up to three players. If only one human player is available, they play against an AI opponent. Before the start of the game, the players can choose their appearance from a number of male and female portraits. The game is played entirely using a touch interface. The game screen displays the word puzzle at the top, the current player and their score in the center and the input panel (with the possible actions and a virtual keyboard for letter input) at the bottom. When the wheel is spinning, it and a close-up of the wheel values are superimposed over the game screen. The game follows the rules of the TV show, with three regular rounds and a final bonus round for the contestant who won the most money.

The game includes 750 word puzzles in more than a dozen categories.</desc>
