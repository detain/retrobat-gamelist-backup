		<path>./No-Intro/Balloon Fight (USA, Europe).sv</path>
		<name>Balloon Fight</name>
		<desc>Balloon Fight is a simple platform action game very similar to the better known NES title of the same name. The player controls a creature suspended by a pair of balloons who floats around a room, and must pop the balloons of enemy creatures by landing on top of them. If an enemy touches the player's balloons, they will pop, causing the player to fall and lose a life.

There are several different stages, each with a different layout and various objects such as platforms, deadly spike pits, and fans that push the balloons around. The playfield also loops horizontally, and both the player and the enemies can leave one side of the screen and return through the other. When all enemies on a stage are defeated, the player is awarded a bonus for time remaining and moves on to the next stage.</desc>

		<name>Block Buster</name>
		<desc>Block Buster is a simple Tetris clone for one player. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in the playfield, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

The most notable difference from regular Tetris is that the game features a 12-by-16-block playfield, compared with the 10-by-20 field found in licensed Tetris titles. There is only one game mode (endless), though the starting level (speed) and amount of garbage can be chosen before starting the game.</desc>

		<name>Brain Power</name>
		<desc>Brain Power is a collection of four primarily logic-and-puzzle minigames:

Mine Detector, a clone of Minesweeper. The player is presented with a board filled with mines, and must find all of the open squares without clicking on any of the mines. Open squares contain a number, which indicates how many of the adjacent squares contains a mine. There are easy (55 mines), medium (66 mines), and hard (77 mines) modes.

Fortune Four, a version of the board game Qubic, also known as 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe. The player takes turn with the computer placing stones on a 4x4x4 grid, the goal being to create a chain of four stones in any direction.

Caterpillar, a clone of Snake. The player controls a snake that must avoid obstacles and eat food placed around the level. When the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, but if it runs into an obstacle or its own body, it dies.

Hopper, a version of the board game Peg Solitaire. The player is given a grid with marbles arranged on it, and can remove marbles by "jumping" over them with an adjacent marble. The goal is to only have a single marble remaining. There are seven different layouts to choose from.</desc>

		<name>Chimera</name>
		<desc>A strange alien spacecraft has been discovered orbiting the Earth, it its weaponry primed and ready to destroy the planet. Your mission: To infiltrate the craft, disable the weapons, initiate the self-destruct sequence, and escape with your life.

Chimera is an isometric adventure game set on an uninhabited space ship. The player must explore the ship, which is divided into a grid of rooms. There are various items scattered around the maze-like craft, which will be either a help or a hindrance. For example, food and water will keep the player alive, while radiators will quickly deplete water reserves while standing in the same room.

The only actions the player can perform are to move and to interact with objects. Many objects ? such as electric fences, or the aforementioned radiators ? are deadly to the touch unless the player has the correct item in their possession. The ultimate goal is to prime and activate the four-stage self destruct sequence in the correct order by using items found on the ship. A scrolling message indicator at the bottom of the screen provides useful status information.</desc>

		<desc>Dream World is a side-scrolling platform game starring a girl with psychic powers. She begins with only a regular energy shot, but additional weapons can be found throughout the game. Curiously, using the girl's ESP powers does not consume energy; rather, switching between shot types does, meaning she can only switch a certain number of times on each stage. Different enemies are weak to different weapons, and each stage ends with a large boss that must be defeated to continue.</desc>

		<desc>Kitchen War is an arcade platform game with a food theme. The player controls a tomato chef whose kitchen has become overrun by insects and other vermin. Using weapons such as plates, forks, and ladles -- found in rooms through out the kitchen -- the player must defeat enough of a certain type of pest, such as a snail, spider, or mouse, to proceed to the next stage. Touching enemies will hurt the chef, though he can recover by finding bottles of ketchup which are also hidden within the rooms. Each weapon can only be used a certain number of times before another must be found.</desc>

After defeating the stage boss, the player moves on to the next stage. There are three stages total.</desc>

		<name>Space Fighter</name>
		<desc>Space Fighter is an action shooting game starring a team of three robot soldiers, who must defend their cities from an enemy robot army. Each stage consists of a small scrolling top-down map filled with enemy robots. The player must shoot and destroy a certain number of enemies on each stage in order to move on to the next.

There are three different robots to choose from, each with their own different abilities. HUNT is the quickest, but can only shoot straight forward; DALE is the slowest but has a powerful spread shot; and OWEN is average pm speed, but can fire in four directions simultaneously. On each stage, there is also a base that can be used to switch robots and refill their energy.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/SSSnake (USA, Europe).sv</path>
		<name>Sssnake</name>
		<desc>Sssnake is a basic Snake game. The player controls a snake in a small room filled with food and obstacles. The goal is to eat all the food while avoiding the obstacles, but whenever the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making it more difficult to maneuver. The snake moves forward at a constant speed and can be turned in the four cardinal directions. Holding a button will make the snake move faster, making it harder to control, but increasing the potential for a time bonus.

In this particular version, there are a number of apples on each stage. When an apple is eaten, it disappears, and an apple core appears elsewhere on the stage, and when the apple core is eaten, a deadly skull appears somewhere else. The player must eat all of the apples and apple cores in one run; they will all be reset if the snake touches an obstacle. The player will also earn bonus points if all the normal apples are eaten before any apple core is eaten.</desc>

		<desc>Super Block is a collection of three block puzzle games:
Play Block is a clone of Flipull. The objective is to launch blocks at other blocks with matching patterns to clear them from the field. Clear enough blocks without running out of moves to move to the next stage.
Fill Block is a clone of Quarth. Groups of blocks fall from the top of the screen, and the objective is to shoot additional blocks at them to create rectangles, causing the blocks to clear. If a block passes the line at the bottom of the screen, the game is over.
Hit Block is a mixture of the two other games. Blocks of varying types fall from the top of the screen, and the player must launch a matching block at it to remove it from play. Launching the wrong type will add it to the stack. If a block passes the line at the bottom of the screen, the game is over.</desc>

		<name>Super Kong</name>
		<desc>Super Kong is a simple action game that plays like a cross between Pooyan and Donkey Kong 3. The titular Super Kong slowly climbs a vine on the left edge of the screen, while the player controls a young child on a vine at the right edge. The object is to throw balls at Kong to knock him down the vine, ultimately knocking him out at the bottom. However, many obstructions fall from the top of the screen, and Kong himself can throw a large projectile that can knock the child out, losing a life. There are a handful of power-ups to assist the player, and it is also possible to jump off the vine to avoid Kong's attacks. The game includes three stages of increasing difficulty.</desc>

However, it's not that simple; when shot, the balloons will split into two smaller balloons, and only the smallest size will be destroyed when hit. There are several power-ups that will randomly appear to aid the player, including long-lasting shots, quick-fire shots, and scrolls that instantly reduce all balloons on the screen to the smallest size. Pop enough balloons to move onto the next stage.</desc>
