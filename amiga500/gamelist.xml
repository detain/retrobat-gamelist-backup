		<desc>Viewed from above and set in space, Blastar is a multi-directionally scrolling shoot 'em up. Each of the 12 levels have aliens coming at you in all directions, and you must use the scanner to see where they are, and fly around taking them out. The ship has heavy inertia, so you can't brake and steer instantly. Contact with aliens weakens your ship, and eventually costs you one of your 3 lives. The game features a full techno soundtrack, with 1 Megabyte of sound and 3 Megabytes of graphics - both high figures for an OCS game. The playing area totals 400 screens, with animated backgrounds</desc>

The ship has heavy inertia, so you can't brake and steer instantly. Contact with aliens weakens your ship, and eventually costs you one of your 3 lives. The game features a full techno soundtrack, with 1 Megabyte of sound and 3 Megabytes of graphics - both high figures for an OCS game. The playing area totals 400 screens, with animated backgrounds</desc>

		<desc>As the name suggests, this arcade conversion updates the basic Asteroids gameplay. That means to say that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear. In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising Corp's control.</desc>

		<desc>The main character in this old fashioned no frills shoot 'em up is a Rambo doppelganger, which the developers may have been lucky not to be sued over. The main player is surrounded by a large tank which moves around as if you are walking it Flintstones style.

Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.</desc>

		<desc>The first of Blinky the ghost's three outings, the ghost with the most has to progress through a series of levels and remove the hazards left by ghost-busters (who aren't called Peter, Egon, Winston or Ray for licensing reasons). He does this by collecting the right objects to cast the all important spells.

The levels themselves scroll sideways and are layered with platforms. Making the task difficult are spiders, mice and the like - watch out in particular for the jumping frogs. Once the appropriate spells have been cast (involving lots of back-tracking to collect objects and bring them to the cauldron) the objects to make an underwater diving suit must be obtained.</desc>

		<desc>This was the Ottfried Schmidt's first and last commercial game. If you were a fan of Andrew Braybrook's classic Uridium, but were disappointed with the Amiga conversion, then Blizzard may well be for you. Although not quite as technically stunning as Uridium 2, Blizzard is a no-thrills shoot 'em up based very closely on Braybrook's C64 classic.

The basic idea is to fly a small spacecraft across the surface of a large starcruiser, shooting alien ships as they fly by with guns blazing. Most fly in formation, making them very easy to kill, but look out for space mines and vertical sections of the starcruiser that just out into space Ã¢â‚¬â€œ get hit by any of these obstructions and you are space dust (not to be confused with banned sweet).</desc>

		<name>Blob</name>
		<desc>This 3D puzzle game stars an amorphous blue creature, and presents you with a top-viewed world in which the character is closer to you when it's near the top of the level. A number of blocks are suspended in space, and you bounce around these trying to reach the exit, having first completed the level's objectives. These include painting certain blocks à la Q*Bert, collecting objects and rescuing other blobs by guiding them to the exit. 

Additional types of block includes ones which shoot at you, cracked tiles which don't last long, sticky tiles you can't get much leverage from, and switches to make other blocks become visible or accessible. The 3D is an integral aspect of the game, with falling off ledges into oblivion causing the loss of a life.</desc>

		<desc>This 3D puzzle game stars an amorphous blue creature, and presents you with a top-viewed world in which the character is closer to you when it's near the top of the level. A number of blocks are suspended in space, and you bounce around these trying to reach the exit, having first completed the level's objectives. These include painting certain blocks à la Q*Bert, collecting objects and rescuing other blobs by guiding them to the exit. 

Additional types of block includes ones which shoot at you, cracked tiles which don't last long, sticky tiles you can't get much leverage from, and switches to make other blocks become visible or accessible. The 3D is an integral aspect of the game, with falling off ledges into oblivion causing the loss of a life.</desc>

		<name>Blobz</name>
		<desc>Not the most inspiring name for a game, but then look at Worms and how successful that title was. Blobz steals its gameplay style directly from Lemmings, replacing the suicidal rodents with green nondescript things decked out with tiny eyes.

While Lemmings' motivation for suicide is biological, blobs just don't know any better. If they walk into spikes or water they die, but there's no stopping them. A walking they will go, straight into trouble. The puzzles themselves are satisfying, if frustrating and they have been well thought out using the various 'skills' which you can assign each Blob. Smooth horizontal scrolling and the neat moving water effects and special touches are very nice. While the platforms themselves might look basic, there is a good reason for this: a level designer has been included so you can make as many as you like, and it's simple to use. The game is based on six worlds each mapped out like a maze and there are 60 levels in total.

The amount of levels and the increasing difficulty means that this is not a fast game to finish. Add the possibility of infinite custom levels and you have a lot of game. A well recommended download.</desc>

		<name>Blobz</name>
		<desc>Not the most inspiring name for a game, but then look at Worms and how successful that title was. Blobz steals its gameplay style directly from Lemmings, replacing the suicidal rodents with green nondescript things decked out with tiny eyes.

While Lemmings' motivation for suicide is biological, blobs just don't know any better. If they walk into spikes or water they die, but there's no stopping them. A walking they will go, straight into trouble. The puzzles themselves are satisfying, if frustrating and they have been well thought out using the various 'skills' which you can assign each Blob. Smooth horizontal scrolling and the neat moving water effects and special touches are very nice. While the platforms themselves might look basic, there is a good reason for this: a level designer has been included so you can make as many as you like, and it's simple to use. The game is based on six worlds each mapped out like a maze and there are 60 levels in total.

The amount of levels and the increasing difficulty means that this is not a fast game to finish. Add the possibility of infinite custom levels and you have a lot of game. A well recommended download.</desc>

		<desc>Blockout is a Tetris clone with an added twist: it's in 3D. You can rotate the blocks in 3D in order to fit them into the pit they are being guided into. Advanced users can play this game with odd three-dimensional pieces, or change the size of the pit, for depth of between 6 and 18 piles, and width and length of between 3 and 7.</desc>

The playing field is filled with different blocks and your aim is to fill them in so they form complete rectangles or squares.

		<desc>A bat. And a ball. That bounces. It is a simple premise. And as some clever bloke found out at the dawn of computer gaming, it is really good fun. Simple, yes, but fun in the extreme.
But things do not stay still in the fast moving world of games, oh no. And so a simple bat and ball game gets loads of power-ups, wacky level designs and if you are really lucky even some decent collision detection. In fact, you could say, it is a whole new ball game.

It is all good stuff so far, but there is something not quite right when you get down to playing the game. Some of the levels are downright boring and others are just stupid, but it is not just level design. Playing just is not enough fun. Everything works fine, even if the mouse control is a little over sensitive, but you always get the sense that when you lose a ball, it was not the fact that you were not in the right place and at right time, but that the game had already decided you were going to lose a life.

Yes, I know that makes me sound like a paranoid madman, but that is the only way I can describe it. It is cheap, playable and intriguing to start with, but eventually becomes slow, repetitive and slightly annoying. But it scores points for the user-friendly level editor.</desc>

When you have collected all the ingredients you must move the pot into the exit which opens to complete the level. You will be awarded points for how long you took to complete the level (shown as a yellow clock), your remaining energy supply (a red heart) and how many secret gems you found (shown as a blue diamond).</desc>

		<desc>Blockhead is an Puzzle game, developed by Applaud and published by Islona, which was released in Europe in 1997.

Blockhead is a puzzle game similar to Sokoban. The player controls a character called Bertie from a top down perspective who has to push and pull boxes into their holes. Once all boxes have been placed correctly an exit opens that Bertie has to reach to end the level and move on to the next. The game is timed.

On the right side of the screen is a character called Petrified Pete who above him has a falling 16 ton weight. The player has to complete the level before the weight crushes Pete. If failing to so a life is lost and the current level has to be restarted. As the weight falls it changes from gold to silver to bronze. The higher value it has when the level is completed the more points will be earned. Another way to earn extra points is to collect the fruit (bananas, apples, oranges) and hidden jewels that are scattered around the levels. Blocks can have different colors and they then has to be pushed to holes with the same color. Some levels have dynamite that is needed to blow up certain walls.</desc>

		<name>Blood Money</name>
		<desc>The speech in the introductory sequence probably sums things up best - "the biggest unanswered question is 'where is the money?"

The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage.

The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck through gaps in scenery.</desc>

		<desc>The speech in the introductory sequence probably sums things up best - "the biggest unanswered question is 'where is the money?"

The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage.

The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck through gaps in scenery.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Ransom Stark, a computer hacker, scrounger or mercenary (depending on how the player answers the opening questions when they start a new game) who finds himself caught up in a sinister affair involving an evil global megacorporation, TransTechnicals, Manhattan, a fight for Cyberspace and vampires!

Ransom Stark became stricken with Hopkins-Brie Ontology Syndrome whilst working at TransTechnicals, due to his forced extended exposure to Cyberspace while he worked there. As soon as he was diagnosed he was dismissed from TransTech and found himself homeless and hopeless. Thankfully an ingenious woman, with a personal vendetta against TransTech, named Deirdre Tackett saved his life by inserting a prototype brain implant of her own design and this restoring his grip on reality.

Over the following year Ransom became known as a reliable freelance until one day he got a job worth much more than he bargained for! His employers turned out to be vampires and as part of his 'payment', Ransom was turned into a follower of the evil head-vampire, Abraham Van Helsing -- except his brain implant kicked in allowing him to keep temporary control of his humanity.

Now Ransom must put a stop to Van Helsing's plans to take over Manhattan and control Cyberspace and hopefully save himself from being a vampire before its too late!

Thankfully an ingenious woman, with a personal vendetta against TransTech, named Deirdre Tackett saved his life by inserting a prototype brain implant of her own design and this restoring his grip on reality.

Over the following year Ransom became known as a reliable freelance until one day he got a job worth much more than he bargained for! His employers turned out to be vampires and as part of his 'payment', Ransom was turned into a follower of the evil head-vampire, Abraham Van Helsing -- except his brain implant kicked in allowing him to keep temporary control of his humanity.

Now Ransom must put a stop to Van Helsing's plans to take over Manhattan and control Cyberspace and hopefully save himself from being a vampire before its too late!

You play as Ransom Stark, a computer hacker, scrounger or mercenary (depending on how the player answers the opening questions when they start a new game) who finds himself caught up in a sinister affair involving an evil global megacorporation, TransTechnicals, Manhattan, a fight for Cyberspace and vampires!

Ransom Stark became stricken with Hopkins-Brie Ontology Syndrome whilst working at TransTechnicals, due to his forced extended exposure to Cyberspace while he worked there. As soon as he was diagnosed he was dismissed from TransTech and found himself homeless and hopeless. Thankfully an ingenious woman, with a personal vendetta against TransTech, named Deirdre Tackett saved his life by inserting a prototype brain implant of her own design and this restoring his grip on reality.

Over the following year Ransom became known as a reliable freelance until one day he got a job worth much more than he bargained for! His employers turned out to be vampires and as part of his 'payment', Ransom was turned into a follower of the evil head-vampire, Abraham Van Helsing -- except his brain implant kicked in allowing him to keep temporary control of his humanity.

Now Ransom must put a stop to Van Helsing's plans to take over Manhattan and control Cyberspace and hopefully save himself from being a vampire before its too late!</desc>

		<desc>The land of Trazere was once ruled by the powerful and benevolent organisation of mages known as the Bloodwych. Governed by the Great Dragon, the Bloodwych kept the country in balance, protecting it from evil and leading it to prosperity. However, the second-in-command of the Bloodwych, named Zendick, turned against his group, banished his opponents to the astral plane, and began working on a mad plan to summon the Lord of Entropy. The player controls the champion of Trazere, whose goal is to stop Zendick and restore peace to the land.
Bloodwych is a 3D maze game in first person. The special feature of this game is the two-player split screen support.
Each player controls a group of four characters. The four basic classes are warrior, mage, adventurer and thief.</desc>

		<desc>Bloody Afternoon is a horror-themed arcade shooter controlled with the mouse. Skeletons and other monsters have taken over a spooky castle, and they have a number of hostages. It is your job to shoot your way through a series of static scenes where enemies and hostages will appear in various places on the screen, popping up over walls and through windows. You will sometimes need to shoot at the right point on the targets, for example aiming for the head if an enemy is wearing chest armor, or aiming at a hostage's arm restraints to free them without harming them. There are three difficulty settings.</desc>

		<desc>Blue And the Gray is a Strategy game, developed by Edward Grabowski Communications Ltd and published by Impressions Games, which was released in Europe in 1994.

A game based on the American Civil War, eh?  I'll tell you this for nothing, it won't catch over here. Jumping straight into the Gone With The Wind era isn't the most engaging of subjects for us 'limeys' to bother with, preferring as we do to mess with our own history rather than someone else's. Edward Grabowski may not be the most familiar name on this 'side of the pond', but Stateside he's renowned from Baltimore to Yazzo County for his Micro Miniatures wargame system.

The initial stages of forming armies and planning strategies on the big ol' American map, checking on resources and second-guessing the enemy is both engrossing and friendly to use. So why is it bad? Userunfriendliness is the plain and simple answer. Graphically it is not so hot either but that's never really been a problem as far as wargames are concerned.

Graphics aside, the Micro Miniatures system is one that seems to have been designed with the artificial intelligence factor at the top of its list of priorities Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while decent control has taken a back seat. Issuing orders, strategic battle methods and realism aren't this game's strong points: You can tell everyone, a particular group or a single unit to go to a set position on screen and then engage the enemy, but little else.

The Blue And The Gray needs a more usable battle interface. One that allows for all sorts of situations and events. Without it, it's a hollow fight.</desc>

Instead of shooting downs MIGs or make bomb runs as in other flight sims, here you perform over 25 actual air show maneuvers with your famed acrobatic squadron the Blue Angels. Unfortunately the flight dynamics were almost non existent

Overall, a fun game for flight sim beginners who aren't too concerned with realism in their games-- definitely not for ace pilots.</desc>

		<desc>Blue Max is a World War I fighter plane simulator, where the player may fly fighter planes such as Fokker, Sopwith, Spad, and many other ones. 

The game allows split screen gaming for two players, cooperatively or competitively, with multiple 3D camera angle features. Missions involve shooting down enemy planes, while others focus on specific targets. The game includes a very unique feature for those who chose to use it: the ability to convert the dogfights to turn-based battles fought on a hexagonal map but still maintaining the 3D view in a frozen window</desc>

		<desc>Blue Max is a World War I fighter plane simulator, where the player may fly fighter planes such as Fokker, Sopwith, Spad, and many other ones. 

The game allows split screen gaming for two players, cooperatively or competitively, with multiple 3D camera angle features. Missions involve shooting down enemy planes, while others focus on specific targets. The game includes a very unique feature for those who chose to use it: the ability to convert the dogfights to turn-based battles fought on a hexagonal map but still maintaining the 3D view in a frozen window</desc>

		<desc>This is an overhead-viewed racing game similar in style to Super Sprint. There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score.

There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.</desc>

		<name>Bob's Bad Day</name>
		<desc>The reason why Bob's having a bad day is that his head has become detached from his body, and they've been hurtled off into different places. To retrieve his body, he must progress through 50 levels, then a further 50 to escape before he can be put back together.

Gameplay involves the character being on a rotating landscape with a set number of coins placed all over it. By rotating the joystick, the player moves the landscape so that Bob moves over the coins and finds the exit. 

The levels include many spikes, contact with which causes the loss of coins; if the player has no coins when contact is made, it's game over. Some level designs are fiendish, with lots of corridors and alleyways, teleports, and bricks to break through (by building up enough momentum).

There are a host of special 'power-ups' across the level as well. The simplest ones (and the first ones the player will meet) change the direction of gravity, causing the player's character to automatically 'fall' to the left when not in motion. Others include a sticky mode where Bob stops bouncing (unless the player presses the fire button), a heavier-bounce mode, and a very useful one allowing the player to 'thrust' Bob around, ideal for reaching precariously-placed coins.

Once the player reaches level 51 a further twist is added - Bob's body starts in a separate point of the level, and this must also be coaxed to the exit. The view always centers on Bob's head, even once this is in the exit, so the player will have to use the scanner alone to guide the body across - knowing that a move which benefits one can drag the other off course.</desc>

		<desc>The reason why Bob's having a bad day is that his head has become detached from his body, and they've been hurtled off into different places. To retrieve his body, he must progress through 50 levels, then a further 50 to escape before he can be put back together.

Gameplay involves the character being on a rotating landscape with a set number of coins placed all over it. By rotating the joystick, the player moves the landscape so that Bob moves over the coins and finds the exit. 

The levels include many spikes, contact with which causes the loss of coins; if the player has no coins when contact is made, it's game over. Some level designs are fiendish, with lots of corridors and alleyways, teleports, and bricks to break through (by building up enough momentum).

There are a host of special 'power-ups' across the level as well. The simplest ones (and the first ones the player will meet) change the direction of gravity, causing the player's character to automatically 'fall' to the left when not in motion. Others include a sticky mode where Bob stops bouncing (unless the player presses the fire button), a heavier-bounce mode, and a very useful one allowing the player to 'thrust' Bob around, ideal for reaching precariously-placed coins.

Once the player reaches level 51 a further twist is added - Bob's body starts in a separate point of the level, and this must also be coaxed to the exit. The view always centers on Bob's head, even once this is in the exit, so the player will have to use the scanner alone to guide the body across - knowing that a move which benefits one can drag the other off course.</desc>

It was followed by Body Blows Galactic and Ultimate Body Blows. A version for DOS was also released. The game has a lot of similarities to Street Fighter II, for example, both had two characters with projectile, rising uppercut and spinning kick special moves and played identically (as with Ryu and Ken).

		<desc>Body Blows is an Amiga versus fighting game. It was released in 1993 by Team17. The game is compatible with all Amiga systems, including the CDTV system with joystick support. It was followed by Body Blows Galactic and Ultimate Body Blows. A version for DOS was also released. The game has a lot of similarities to Street Fighter II, for example, both had two characters with projectile, rising uppercut and spinning kick special moves and played identically (as with Ryu and Ken).

		<desc>In the follow-up to Body Blows, Dan and Junior (two characters from the original, based around programmers Danny Burke and Cedric McMillan Jr.) are representing Earth in an intergalactic fight competition. Five other planets are involved, each submitting 2 brav fighters - the advanced Titanica, the divided Eclipse, the prehistoric Gellorn-5, the morphed Misma, and the matriachal Feminion.

Combat works in a similar way to the original, with moves designed around a one-button controller, with special moves activated either by a particular joystick movement while jumping, or by holding the fire button to charge the move up. The one-player game sees you progress through fighting the other characters in turn. Multiplayer options include character V character and a 4/8-player tournament.</desc>

		<desc>In the follow-up to Body Blows, Dan and Junior (two characters from the original, based around programmers Danny Burke and Cedric McMillan Jr.) are representing Earth in an intergalactic fight competition. Five other planets are involved, each submitting 2 brav fighters - the advanced Titanica, the divided Eclipse, the prehistoric Gellorn-5, the morphed Misma, and the matriachal Feminion.

Combat works in a similar way to the original, with moves designed around a one-button controller, with special moves activated either by a particular joystick movement while jumping, or by holding the fire button to charge the move up. The one-player game sees you progress through fighting the other characters in turn. Multiplayer options include character V character and a 4/8-player tournament.</desc>

		<name>Bograts - The Puzzling Misadventure</name>
		<desc>Bograts, The Puzzling Misadventure is a Puzzle game, developed and published by Vulcan Software, which was released in Europe in 1996.

"It isn't easy being a parent, as any Bograt will tell you", begins the blurb for Bograts, Vulcan Software's latest MiniSeries game.

Anyway, easy or not, you're a Bograt, and you've been left in charge of your two offspring (affectionately known as "Red" and "Blue") for an evening. Right on cue, they go off and decide it's time to go hunting for the magical eggs at the big bad Mystical Castle of Bog. Right, that's the plot out of the way. Yes, it's another save'em'up - get dumb creatures from A to B without being killed along the way.

The first real criticism is that the graphics just aren't clear enough and what really annoyed me, however, was the restart level facility - or the lack of it. You cannot start a level again from scratch - you either start from the very beginning of level 1 again, or you load a saved game.

Pros: Level designs show thought, and the puzzle fan will enjoy working through of the 60 stages - plenty to be going on with. Cons: Confusing graphics, and poor restart facilities. Not for those without a brain.</desc>

There are two Ã¢â‚¬Å“crittersÃ¢â‚¬Â in his world: the good, red-and-white-checkered Boing! balls, which he is to collect for points, and the evil, black-and-green-checkered balls, which for some reason not explained by modern science, are ravenously hungry. For Seymour, his only defense is to find a large needle and poke a bad ball with it, after which the needle is ruined.</desc>

		<name>Bomb Busters</name>
		<desc>Bomb Busters is a variant of the arcade game Bomb Jack. It's a single screen platform game where the player has to collect a number of bombs. At any time one of the bombs will blink meaning that it is active and will soon explode. These active bombs are worth more points when collected but the risk is higher since the player will die if caught within the blast radius. In this version the player character doesn't fly but has a jetpack allowing him to move vertically. In addition to exploding bombs there are also various enemies moving around that are lethal to touch. Various bonus items can be collected: B's for extra points, P's for Pac-Man-like invulnerability and L's for extra lives.

The game also has an unusual two player mode where both players cooperate in controlling a single character. How this should work can be set up before starting the game. Each player can be handled different parts of the control. For example one player moves left and the other right. It's also possible to set it up so that both player has to do the same thing at the same time. So to jump both player has to press the their jump buttons at the same time.</desc>

		<desc>Bomb Busters is a variant of the arcade game Bomb Jack. It's a single screen platform game where the player has to collect a number of bombs. At any time one of the bombs will blink meaning that it is active and will soon explode. These active bombs are worth more points when collected but the risk is higher since the player will die if caught within the blast radius. In this version the player character doesn't fly but has a jetpack allowing him to move vertically. In addition to exploding bombs there are also various enemies moving around that are lethal to touch. Various bonus items can be collected: B's for extra points, P's for Pac-Man-like invulnerability and L's for extra lives.

The game also has an unusual two player mode where both players cooperate in controlling a single character. How this should work can be set up before starting the game. Each player can be handled different parts of the control. For example one player moves left and the other right. It's also possible to set it up so that both player has to do the same thing at the same time. So to jump both player has to press the their jump buttons at the same time.</desc>

		<desc>Terrorists have planted bombs all over the Sellerscale Nuclear Processing Plant and will destroy the Northern Hemisphere if they aren't defused. You play the hero selected for this dangerous mission in this single screen platform game spread over various levels. On each level is a various amount of bombs and when one is nine seconds from exploding then you have to reach it and touch it to reset it before it explodes. If it explodes it will increase a radiation meter on the left of the screen and when it is full you lose one of three lives.

As you defuse the bombs, fuel capsules are sprayed out by a pipe and a certain number also need collecting and put in a box and you can carry as many capsules as you want. To reach higher platforms you can either use pipes that make you bounce higher or you can fall of the bottom of the screen to appear at the top. Moving about the screen is a ball and if you touch it carrying capsules then you lose them and you also increase the radiation meter. Once you have collected enough capsules and defused a certain amount of bombs then you move to the next level.</desc>

		<desc>Bomb Jack is an arcade platform game that was released in 1984 by Tehkan (known today as Tecmo). It was followed by two official sequels, the console and computer title Mighty Bomb Jack, and the arcade game Bomb Jack Twin and Bomb Jack II, which was licensed for home computers only. The highest known score was by Mr G Jones from London: 6 746 800.

Bomb Jack is a hero who can perform high jumps and float in the air. His goal is to collect all red bombs on the screen. The game's antagonists are enemies such as birds and mummies which, once they drop in the bottom of the screen, can morph into things like flying saucers and orbs that float around the screen, making Jack lose a life if he touches them. Collecting bombs will increase the bonus meter at the top of the screen (collecting lit bombs increases it more). When the meter is completely filled up, a circular bouncing "P" appears, and when collected, it will turn all the enemies into bonus coins for a short period during which Jack may collect them. Other similar bonuses are the B (Bonus) which increases the score multiplier (up to 5x), the E (Extra) which gives an extra life, and the rare S (Special), which awards a free game. There are five different screens in the game, each featuring a distinct scheme of platforms (the fifth has no platforms at all). There is a special bonus for collecting 21 or more lit bombs in a row, out of the 24 bombs of each round.</desc>

		<desc>Bomber Bob is a vertically scrolling shooter by Italian studio Idea. The player controls a dog flying a World War 1 plane, able to shoot both other aircrafts in the air (controlled by humorous caricatures of dogs, pigs wearing WW1 helmets and other animals) and bomb targets on the ground for coins, via a fixed crosshairs like in Xevious or Twinbee. These coins can be spent in between levels to purchase weapon upgrade and extra lives from a vending machine. Also in between levels the game offers a few false-3D flying stages where we see the plane from behind and have to fly through a tunnel while trying to avoid the walls. There also are a few end level bosses, mostly farm animals. The game is imbued with humor: destroyed enemies plummet to the ground like Wile E. Coyote from the Road Runner cartoons, accompanied by funny voices and sound effects, matching the cartoony feel of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Bomber Bob is a vertically scrolling shooter by Italian studio Idea. The player controls a dog flying a World War 1 plane, able to shoot both other aircrafts in the air (controlled by humorous caricatures of dogs, pigs wearing WW1 helmets and other animals) and bomb targets on the ground for coins, via a fixed crosshairs like in Xevious or Twinbee. These coins can be spent in between levels to purchase weapon upgrade and extra lives from a vending machine. Also in between levels the game offers a few false-3D flying stages where we see the plane from behind and have to fly through a tunnel while trying to avoid the walls. There also are a few end level bosses, mostly farm animals. The game is imbued with humor: destroyed enemies plummet to the ground like Wile E. Coyote from the Road Runner cartoons, accompanied by funny voices and sound effects, matching the cartoony feel of the game.</desc>

		<name>Bombmania</name>
		<desc>Bombmania is a Bomberman variant. The player, without a specific background story, has to solve 80 levels which are divided between four scenarios. The basic principle: there are many enemies in the levels which should be killed by using the unlimited amount of bombs. Every time a bomb is placed on the ground, the player has a few moments to get out of range to avoid being killed by the blast, which evolves horizontally and vertically from the bomb point. The basic range of a bomb is one field. Besides the enemies, most level obstacles can also be bombed away.

However, there are various power-ups which slightly change the gameplay when picked up, e.g. greater speed, bombs with a higher range, mines (explode when someone walks over it), or remote controlled bombs. The scenarios differ in environments and enemies, e.g. the labyrinth scenario has turtles which require multiple hits or the desert has droids which replicate over time. Each level has a time limit and the two-player duels can be either played turn-based or simultaneously.</desc>

Bigger ones have such a huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode smaller bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned.

Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.</desc>

		<desc>Little Bombuzal has to blow up bombs on little islands in this puzzle game. In order to advance to the next level, all bombs need to detonate. There are various sizes of bombs. Bigger ones have such a huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode smaller bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned.

Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.</desc>

		<desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</desc>

		<name>Bonanza Bros.</name>
		<desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</desc>

		<name>Bonecruncher</name>
		<desc>Bone Cruncher is an Action game, developed and published by Superior Software, which was released in Europe in 1987.

The player controls a dragon called Bono, who operates a soap business. He collects bones from around the chambers of his castle and uses them to make soap in a cauldron. He then delivers the soap to sea-monsters, situated at various exits from the castle. It takes five skeletons to make a bar of soap and five bars of soap must be created, and delivered to the sea-monsters, in each chamber. There are 22 chambers in the castle. There are two other deadly creatures in the castle: monsters and spiders.</desc>

You play some crocodile Dundee clone, killing evildoers (like hairy people, homeless people or pot smokers) and saving threatened grannies. No, I don't have the background story in mind, but it's probably stupendous. Anyway, the idea is that you have to type equations (or click on their parameters) that get plotted on the screen, and that will become your boomerang's trajectory. You eventually get better boomerangs, that allow you to use more complex equations, allowing your boomerang to follow a more complex path. And this is cool. Seeing that you totally don't believe me, I suggest you try it.</desc>

		<name>Boondar</name>
		<desc>Boondar is actually based on an old CBM64 and Spectrum smash-hit game called Bounder. The aim of the game is a simple one, yet a brilliant one; you are a ball, and must get to the end of a huge scrolling course. See? Excellent!

There are number of stepping stones along the way, some of which allow you to bounce on them as many times as you like, while others will dissolve away, leaving you to fall to your death. Other obstacles to be avoided include the many hedges that block your way, along with the odd nasty thing that plops in front of you and jumps up and down. To help you along the way, there are number of bonus tiles (shown with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“?Ã¢â‚¬Â) which, once bounced on, will award varying effects.

Anyway, the joystick controls everything, and other than getting used to the bounce delay and the way the ball reacts to various tiles, it's all pretty damn simple! Have fun, courtesy of The One.</desc>

		<name>Boot, Das</name>
		<desc>Based on the classic German film of the same name this is a submarine simulation set during WW2. Despite being made in 1990 and therefore primarily designed for the A500 I was surprised to find that the game not only detects and makes use of faster (020+) processors but also promotes to run on VGA monitors.

Control is via the mouse and keyboard and as with all such games there are many keys to learn if you want to become proficient in the game. That said the game is quite accessible without a deep knowledge of these keys. The game menu offers 8 training modes; 4 above and 4 below the surface.

The 6 included scenarios follow the film plot and range from the fjord patrol through operations in the North Atlantic to Gibraltar and the Mediterranean. Difficulty levels are available with the selection of such parameters as torpedo reliability, spares availability and repair states.

On the down side the game suffers from the same problem that inflicts all sub sims, namely lack of action. However, since this is a generic problem and not just akin to this game it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it any worse than itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peers.

As a game, whilst it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become a member of my "top tier" it certainly has earned a place on my hard drive and the right to remain there. This is a game which has changed my views on sub sims due to its playability and nice graphics. So if like me youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried sub sims before but never really liked them, try this game out  If you give it a chance it may just change your opinion of the genre too.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the classic German film of the same name this is a submarine simulation set during WW2. Despite being made in 1990 and therefore primarily designed for the A500 I was surprised to find that the game not only detects and makes use of faster (020+) processors but also promotes to run on VGA monitors.

Control is via the mouse and keyboard and as with all such games there are many keys to learn if you want to become proficient in the game. That said the game is quite accessible without a deep knowledge of these keys. The game menu offers 8 training modes; 4 above and 4 below the surface.

The 6 included scenarios follow the film plot and range from the fjord patrol through operations in the North Atlantic to Gibraltar and the Mediterranean. Difficulty levels are available with the selection of such parameters as torpedo reliability, spares availability and repair states.

On the down side the game suffers from the same problem that inflicts all sub sims, namely lack of action. However, since this is a generic problem and not just akin to this game it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it any worse than itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peers.

As a game, whilst it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become a member of my "top tier" it certainly has earned a place on my hard drive and the right to remain there. This is a game which has changed my views on sub sims due to its playability and nice graphics. So if like me youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried sub sims before but never really liked them, try this game out  If you give it a chance it may just change your opinion of the genre too.</desc>

On the down side the game suffers from the same problem that inflicts all sub sims, namely lack of action. However, since this is a generic problem and not just akin to this game it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it any worse than itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peers.

As a game, whilst it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become a member of my "top tier" it certainly has earned a place on my hard drive and the right to remain there. This is a game which has changed my views on sub sims due to its playability and nice graphics. So if like me youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried sub sims before but never really liked them, try this game out  If you give it a chance it may just change your opinion of the genre too.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the classic German film of the same name this is a submarine simulation set during WW2. Despite being made in 1990 and therefore primarily designed for the A500 I was surprised to find that the game not only detects and makes use of faster (020+) processors but also promotes to run on VGA monitors.

Control is via the mouse and keyboard and as with all such games there are many keys to learn if you want to become proficient in the game. That said the game is quite accessible without a deep knowledge of these keys. The game menu offers 8 training modes; 4 above and 4 below the surface.

The 6 included scenarios follow the film plot and range from the fjord patrol through operations in the North Atlantic to Gibraltar and the Mediterranean. Difficulty levels are available with the selection of such parameters as torpedo reliability, spares availability and repair states.

On the down side the game suffers from the same problem that inflicts all sub sims, namely lack of action. However, since this is a generic problem and not just akin to this game it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it any worse than itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peers.

As a game, whilst it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become a member of my "top tier" it certainly has earned a place on my hard drive and the right to remain there. This is a game which has changed my views on sub sims due to its playability and nice graphics. So if like me youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried sub sims before but never really liked them, try this game out  If you give it a chance it may just change your opinion of the genre too.</desc>

		<desc>Boppin' is a puzzle-oriented video game created by Jennifer Diane Reitz in 1991, developed under the company name Accursed Toys and published by KarmaSoft for the Amiga computer with only 32 colors on screen. Around that time KarmaSoft held a level design contest. The game sold poorly with 284 copies, so Jennifer got it republished by Apogee Software (now known as 3D Realms) with up to 256 colors on screen. Due to mature content containing blood and Seppuku, the game was rated for players aged 25.

The game takes place in a multiverse where fictional universes exist mostly by the minds and dreams of people. One such universe called Arcapaedia is inhabited by video game characters, especially the two stick-figured, triangle-headed Yeet and Boik. However all the arcade games have been diminished due to the lack of bad guys and villains taken away by the puristic Hunnybunz Family. Since heroes and good guys are not able to rescue the missing characters, Yeet and Boik having a neutral alignment, set off to thwart Hunnybunz, his wife and his lovechild's intentions.</desc>

		<name>Borobodur - The Planet of Doom</name>
		<desc>Borobodur: The Planet of Doom is an Action game, developed by Softeyes and published by Thalamus, which was released in Europe in 1992.

As a platform and blast adventure, you must progress through all levels by collecting the various icons scattered at the most inconvenient of places. Who put the required object on a platform that demands a super-hyper jump from a dangerously high-up ledge?

It's not all run, jump and shoot, though. Sub-levels include a puzzle game against the computer where you shuffle square blocks about a board in an attempt to recreate the original pattern. There's also a turbo bike section, featuring an Outrun/Lotus perspective. Final words: Frustratingly slow and tedious with minimal action.</desc>

		<name>Time to Die</name>
		<desc>Borrowed Time is set in mid-1930's. The player assumes the role of a private investigator named Sam Harlow, who has to solve the kidnapping of his ex-wife Rita Sweeney. At the beginning, he runs away from two thugs, who want to kill him for an unknown reason. They fail, and he begins to search the town for clues, asking its inhabitants for information. But if the player makes a wrong move, Sam dies - killers come from nowhere and murder him...

The player has to type in combinations of verbs and nouns to make an action. Locations are described in text form and presented by pictures, the latter often providing additional information not contained in the text description.</desc>

		<name>Botics</name>
		<desc>Botics is a Pong variant set in the future. It is disguised as futuristic sports event in which the player fights against five opponents. The basic idea is that each playfield has a large opening on two sides which are guarded by remote-controlled robots. Each of the opponents controls a robot with the goal to reflect a bouncing ball so it enters the opposite opening. If that happens, the screen switches to the next of five areas, e.g. if the players were in the second chamber, they either switch to area one or three depending on who scored. A player needs to score a certain amount of times to win a match.

Variations to the areas (which are the same for each opponent) consist of obstacles covering the middle of the room. There is also the possibility to charge up the robot which results in a more powerful and fast returning of the ball, but when overdone it causes the robot to explode.</desc>

		<desc>Rockford the Ant returns in another Boulder Dash adventure contains 15 new levels, in addition to the easy-to-use game editor. Players can build, save, and play their own levels. The software includes a feature to sequence your levels on a separate game disk.

All of the elements and hazards from the previous Boulder Dash outings are back: The fireflies, butterflies, growing amoebas, enchanted walls, and of course, the boulders. New features include titanium (indestructible) walls, growing walls, and slime that allows boulders and diamonds to drop through it at a varying rate.</desc>

		<desc>Bouncing Bill is a non-scrolling platformer in which the player controls a ball which moves through four scenarios (house, jungle, forest and space). The ball can roll or jump which is necessary to leap over gaps, collect items (e.g. keys) and avoid enemies which move through the screens on fixed paths. The screens are interconnected with exits and can be explored in a non-linear fashion. Running out of time, jumping too far down or touching an enemy results results in the loss of a life.</desc>

		<desc>Bowls is a game based on the sport with the same name. You start by rolling a small white ball (known as the jack). Once it has come to rest the players roll bigger and heavier bowls towards the jack. After each competitor has used up their allocated number of bowls,one player is awarded points for the number of his bowls are closer to the jack than his opponent's closest bowl.

The game screen is divided in three parts. Half of it is the lane viewed from a top down perspective, with two markers one for the position of the player and the other for the direction. The upper right part of the screen is where you change you position, direction and spin. The lower right part of the screen shows the player from the sideline. It can be played on different lanes (inside, outside and beach) and can be played against the computer or another player.</desc>

After each competitor has used up their allocated number of bowls,one player is awarded points for the number of his bowls are closer to the jack than his opponent's closest bowl.

The game screen is divided in three parts. Half of it is the lane viewed from a top down perspective, with two markers one for the position of the player and the other for the direction. The upper right part of the screen is where you change you position, direction and spin. The lower right part of the screen shows the player from the sideline. It can be played on different lanes (inside, outside and beach) and can be played against the computer or another player.</desc>

		<name>Brain Blasters</name>
		<desc>The wizards are revolting (and it's not just their personal habits). Whichever one passes the test of IOZU will become the grand master and dominate the rest. To pass this test the wizard has to defeat the dark side of his spirit by completing a series of memory puzzles. A pattern is displayed at the start of each level, which then has to reproduced by you. Unlike most games you don't control the pieces. Instead you operate a little wizard who has to scurry around collecting the pieces of the pattern as they fall from the heavens and then place them on board. The presentation is very slick. There's a good intro with sampled sound and a snazzy picture. The menu screen has a couple of finely animated dragons and there's an option that lets you trade gold (points) for tips which is another nice touch. 

Brain Blasters is fun to begin with, but after the fifth level, or so, the novelty value begins to pale. There's a two-player mode where a couple of wizards can battle it out for the pieces but even this becomes boring. Devotees of memory puzzles in The Express will probably like this, otherwise you'd be well-advised to try before you buy.</desc>

		<desc>BrainMan is a top-down puzzle game. The player takes control over a blob who has two tasks in each level: collecting enough stars and finally finding the exit. However, there are obstacles, including blocks (which can, similar to Soko-Ban, only pushed but not pulled), closed doors, a time limit or other blobs which should not be touched. Keys, which act like the blocks mentioned before, can be used to open the closed doors. If is possible to get a level into an unwinnable state, e.g. by pushing a key into a corner.</desc>

		<desc>This puzzle game has 101 levels, in which you have to guide a varying number of Brainies of four different colors onto a spot that matches their color. You control a cross-hair, and press fire while over a Brainy to take or give up control of its motion. Running out of time costs you a life.

The challenge lies in the fact that you can only control the direction in which a Brainy will walk. Once this is set, he will continue to walk until he hits a wall, an obstacle or another Brainy. 

To make things a bit more complicated, there are various obstacles like arrows that change the direction a Brainy is walking in and items than can optionally be picked up.</desc>

		<name>Bram Stoker's Dracula</name>
		<desc>One of several adaptations of the 1992 film version of the classic vampire tale, the Amiga version is a side-scrolling action game.

The player controls Jonathan Harker, who, on his quest to destroy the Transylvanian vampire, must make his way through nine levels, starting at a tavern near Dracula's castle and then the castle itself. Back in England, Dracula and his minions must be driven out of a convent, an abbey and the house of Jonathan's fiancée Mina, among others. A primary task in each level is to find and destroy several coffins of Transylvanian earth. Hindering Jonathan on his way are henchmen as well as critters under the vampire's control: bats, rats, snakes and more. The last coffin in each location is usually guarded by one of Dracula's stronger minions, which include his three brides, the madman Renfield, and Mina's friend Lucy, now turned undead.

To defeat the enemies, Jonathan uses punches and kicks. Lost health can be regained by finding potions; extra lives are also available. In addition, Dr. Van Helsing has left holy crosses lying about - once picked up, they enable a powerful ranged holy attack, which only lasts for a short time, however. Staircases and doors connect the different parts of the levels - to open doors, keys must first be found.</desc>

		<name>Bram Stoker's Dracula</name>
		<desc>One of several adaptations of the 1992 film version of the classic vampire tale, the Amiga version is a side-scrolling action game.

The player controls Jonathan Harker, who, on his quest to destroy the Transylvanian vampire, must make his way through nine levels, starting at a tavern near Dracula's castle and then the castle itself. Back in England, Dracula and his minions must be driven out of a convent, an abbey and the house of Jonathan's fiancée Mina, among others. A primary task in each level is to find and destroy several coffins of Transylvanian earth. Hindering Jonathan on his way are henchmen as well as critters under the vampire's control: bats, rats, snakes and more. The last coffin in each location is usually guarded by one of Dracula's stronger minions, which include his three brides, the madman Renfield, and Mina's friend Lucy, now turned undead.

To defeat the enemies, Jonathan uses punches and kicks. Lost health can be regained by finding potions; extra lives are also available. In addition, Dr. Van Helsing has left holy crosses lying about - once picked up, they enable a powerful ranged holy attack, which only lasts for a short time, however. Staircases and doors connect the different parts of the levels - to open doors, keys must first be found.</desc>

		<desc>In Brat you must guide a baby, Nathan, through levels with features such as dynamite, bridges and holes. You do this indirectly, by specifying which direction he goes in, in a manner vaguely similar to Lemmings. You also tell him when to use objects in a simplistic manner similar to the Dizzy games.

The game combines reactions and planning in quite an original way. The character himself isn't at all cutesy, as the title implies, and that may affect your perception of the game.</desc>

You do this indirectly, by specifying which direction he goes in, in a manner vaguely similar to Lemmings. You also tell him when to use objects in a simplistic manner similar to the Dizzy games.

The game combines reactions and planning in quite an original way. The character himself isn't at all cutesy, as the title implies, and that may affect your perception of the game.</desc>

You play a character named Kyne, a man who has a price on his head. You must search the mining asteroid, Brattacus, to gather proof of a government plot against you and to try to stay alive. Surveillance cameras are watching you, so take any chance to disable them.

Brataccas is a place where greed and corruption rule the day.  The residents are treacherous, and while they can be bribed they are not above murder, so be careful out there.</desc>

		<name>Bravo Romeo Delta</name>
		<desc>Bravo Romeo Delta is a single player game that allows you to control either the United States' or the USSR's nuclear arsenal during an escalating exchange. Its interface is very basic, with only four screens for reports and input. The game plays in real time and can be set faster. There are dozens of different weapon systems at the player's command, including: air dropped gravity bombs, sub-launched ballistic missiles, ICBM silos, and mobile launchers. Data for each weapon and vehicle is accessible. Locations are displayed as geographic coordinates. Success at destroying a chosen target relies on several factors such as weather or hardness penetration of an attacking missile.

The game begins as a Soviet submarine has launched a salvo of three missiles at the United States. The player takes control of one nation and must slowly "out-nullify" the computer player's ability to command, communicate, and attack with his payloads. The computer player reacts to a slow escalation in kind, but if population centers are attacked will realistically mutually assure destruction. Game objectives are very hard to achieve. The player must capitulate the computer through destruction of its arsenal and command while maintaining a superior threat level preserved from the computer player's strikes.</desc>

The player must capitulate the computer through destruction of its arsenal and command while maintaining a superior threat level preserved from the computer player's strikes.</desc>

		<desc>Bravo Romeo Delta is a single player game that allows you to control either the United States' or the USSR's nuclear arsenal during an escalating exchange. Its interface is very basic, with only four screens for reports and input. The game plays in real time and can be set faster. There are dozens of different weapon systems at the player's command, including: air dropped gravity bombs, sub-launched ballistic missiles, ICBM silos, and mobile launchers. Data for each weapon and vehicle is accessible. Locations are displayed as geographic coordinates. Success at destroying a chosen target relies on several factors such as weather or hardness penetration of an attacking missile.

The game begins as a Soviet submarine has launched a salvo of three missiles at the United States. The player takes control of one nation and must slowly "out-nullify" the computer player's ability to command, communicate, and attack with his payloads. The computer player reacts to a slow escalation in kind, but if population centers are attacked will realistically mutually assure destruction. Game objectives are very hard to achieve.

		<name>Breach 2</name>
		<desc>An early squad-level tactical combat game, much like the X-Com series of games and the more contemporary Laser Squad. Breach 2 features turn-based combat from an isometric point of view set in the far future. As one of the more unique aspects the squad leaders gain experience from successful missions should they survive.

Breach 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe as Omnitrend's Universe and Rules of Engagement series and shares the same backstory with those games. Breach 2 is a part of the IGS (Interlocking Game System) and compatible with the two Rules of Engagement games. This means you can use Breach 2 to resolve the tactical combat situations, boarding an enemy ship for example, you run into in the starship command simulation, which is the heart and soul of the Rules of Engagement series.

A scenario builder is included with the game, making it possible to create your own missions and trade them.</desc>

		<name>Breach 2</name>
		<desc>An early squad-level tactical combat game, much like the X-Com series of games and the more contemporary Laser Squad. Breach 2 features turn-based combat from an isometric point of view set in the far future. As one of the more unique aspects the squad leaders gain experience from successful missions should they survive.

Breach 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe as Omnitrend's Universe and Rules of Engagement series and shares the same backstory with those games. Breach 2 is a part of the IGS (Interlocking Game System) and compatible with the two Rules of Engagement games. This means you can use Breach 2 to resolve the tactical combat situations, boarding an enemy ship for example, you run into in the starship command simulation, which is the heart and soul of the Rules of Engagement series.

A scenario builder is included with the game, making it possible to create your own missions and trade them.</desc>

		<desc>Breach is a turn-based tactical squad combat game. It introduces the team-oriented missions, RPG-style squad leader development and excellent scenario builder that would grow to be trademarks and would be refined in the sequels Breach 2 and Breach 3.

In the ten missions supplied with the retail version (and potentially infinitely more created with the included scenario builder), a squad of usually five space marines under the command of a squad leader embarks on sci-fi missions that involve hostage rescue, data retrieval or simply elimination of opponents. Squad members advance and act in turn on basis of a movement point system. 

The multi-level maps consist of outside terrain and structures with several stories, connected by lifts, filled with enemies and objects. Squad members can find and use weapons such as grenades, rockets or detonation packs and tools such as Medikits, scanners or shields.

In an unique twist, the squad leader advances from mission to mission (while the rest of the team is always new), improving his basic stats with each successfully completed assignment, based on his performance. Only experienced leaders may attempt STAR-rated scenarios. If the squad leader gets killed, he is lost forever: the game deletes the corresponding leader file.</desc>

		<desc>A straight Breakout clone this, but unfortunately it is a straight Breakout clone that has been irrefutably out-Breakout-cloned by every other Breakout clone on the market. The only two notable changes from the original bat Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ brick game reads thus: your bat can be a.) altered before play to seven marginally (and pointlessly) different sizes and is b.) armed with a laser to shoot Pac-Men and cold roast turkeys (?) who try to rebuild the wall whilst you're busy demolishing It.

So what's wrong with it? Well, unfortunately, without ArkanoidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bonus canisters available tor exploration and exploitation, clearing each screen becomes a methodical and tiring process of moving the bat back and fourth to hit the ball. And besides, all the screens are the same (give or take the irrelevant scrolling backgrounds which change from screen to screen) so the game has no hook or addictiveness to it at all.

		<name>Breathless</name>
		<desc>In Breathless, the human race has been enslaved by evil alien overlords. But some rebel groups haven't given up hope yet and fight against the oppressors. When one of them gets caught, they are being transformed into cyborgs and stuck in complicated mazes that function as arenas, where they have to fight for their honour and maybe their freedom.

Breathless is a first-person-shooter, where the player has to navigate various stages infested with enemies out to get them. The player has a status display at the bottom of the screen. It contains the current score, the remaining health and shield as well as energy and credits. Energy functions as a universal ammo stock, with each of the weapon depleting a certain amount. By picking up credits, the player can buy or upgrade weapons at computer terminals.

The player's goal is to reach the exit of each of the 20 levels. However, there are usually doors in the way that have to be opened by finding the right switches, or obtaining certain key cards to progress further into the maze.</desc>

		<desc>In Breathless, the human race has been enslaved by evil alien overlords. But some rebel groups haven't given up hope yet and fight against the oppressors. When one of them gets caught, they are being transformed into cyborgs and stuck in complicated mazes that function as arenas, where they have to fight for their honour and maybe their freedom.

Breathless is a first-person-shooter, where the player has to navigate various stages infested with enemies out to get them. The player has a status display at the bottom of the screen. It contains the current score, the remaining health and shield as well as energy and credits. Energy functions as a universal ammo stock, with each of the weapon depleting a certain amount. By picking up credits, the player can buy or upgrade weapons at computer terminals.

The player's goal is to reach the exit of each of the 20 levels. However, there are usually doors in the way that have to be opened by finding the right switches, or obtaining certain key cards to progress further into the maze.</desc>

		<name>Hugo</name>
		<desc>The evil witch Hexana kidnapped Hugo's family and he has to rescue them. This game contains five ported levels from the popular TV show:

1. Level 1/1: Hugo is driving on a draisine and has to dodge oncoming trains and dead ends by changing the tracks. On the right side of the screen is a map of the route.
2. Level 1/2: Hugo has to cross a forest and has to dodge several obstacles by jumping over them.
3. Level 2/1: Hugo is climbing a mountain and has to dodge oncoming stones by jumping over them.
4. Level 2/2: Hugo is flying a airplane and has to dodge oncoming balloons.
5. Level 3: You have to choose between three ropes. If you choose the right one your points get doubled.

In every playthrough you have to beat three levels which you choose beforehand. You have to select either 1/1 or 1/2 and either 2/1 or 2/2. Because the levels were created for a TV show were you had to control Hugo with your phone buttons, the controls are simple: Depending on the level there are just two or three buttons to press at the right time.

The levels contained in Hugo were originally released as Hugo - Pa Nye Eventyr and Hugo - Pa Nye Eventyr II.</desc>
