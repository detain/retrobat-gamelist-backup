		<desc>A powerful earthquake in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo released waves of horrifying monsters that had been hiding within the depths of Earth. The city was destroyed, and only a few humans survived. A team of fighters was assembled in an underground complex and sent to fight the monsters on the surface. One of these fighters was imbued with special psionic powers and was entrusted with a mission of utmost importance.

Ashe is a side-view shooter with some platforming elements. The player can explore several interconnected areas, though certain locations can only be accessed in a specific order, after having fulfilled other objectives or acquired the necessary items. The player character uses his psionic ability to shoot energy balls at enemies, which causes his ESP level to be gradually depleted. Certain areas require jumping or climbing on structures to bypass.</desc>

In A.E. the earth is under attack by swarms of aliens who drop bomb after bomb and it's your job to defend planet Earth.

You control a laser cannon that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen. To earn point you should shoot all the alien forces before they shoot you!
The game becomes more challenging when you progress in the game as the alien swarm splits up and attack you from several sides.</desc>

		<desc>The Quasar Empire needed to expand in order to provide enough living space for its inhabitants. They sent a scout to the neighboring Beta Galaxy, with whom they had signed a peace treaty before. However, Beta authorities treated the scout with suspicion, fearing that Quasar Empire would break the treaty and assault them to further their goals. On the way back the scout was killed. A member of a special team known as the Anti-Intruder Rangers is sent to space with a clear objective: find the scout's remains and retrieve the vital information he carried.
AIR is primarily an action game with exploration and light role-playing elements. The player controls a tank-like space vehicle, moving from first-person perspective on planet surfaces. Several planets can be accessed and explored in any order. Contact with an enemy takes the player to a separate overhead screen where the battle takes place. The player must navigate the tank, shooting at the enemy and avoiding its attacks.</desc>

		<desc>Kazumi Kinoshita and Sanae Kanazawa are two high school girls who go on a school trip together with their classmates. Shortly after their arrival at the camp dormitory, various girls become targeted by unknown assailants. In order to solve the mystery the two heroines must talk to their classmates, collect clues, and eventually find the culprits.

Abunai Tengu Densetsu is an adventure game with menu-based navigation and input. Most screens offer a fairly long list of verb commands, some of which must be combined with objects or persons selected from a sub-menu in order to interact with the environment. The game allows the player to visit many different rooms and other locations in any order; however, certain events must be triggered in order to advance, sometimes by repeatedly selecting commands. Certain situations require the player to find items and use them in a different location. The game contains scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.</desc>

		<desc>Kazumi Kinoshita and Sanae Kanazawa are two high school girls who go on a school trip together with their classmates. Shortly after their arrival at the camp dormitory, various girls become targeted by unknown assailants. In order to solve the mystery the two heroines must talk to their classmates, collect clues, and eventually find the culprits.

Abunai Tengu Densetsu is an adventure game with menu-based navigation and input. Most screens offer a fairly long list of verb commands, some of which must be combined with objects or persons selected from a sub-menu in order to interact with the environment. The game allows the player to visit many different rooms and other locations in any order; however, certain events must be triggered in order to advance, sometimes by repeatedly selecting commands. Certain situations require the player to find items and use them in a different location. The game contains scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Fantasian - Quest for Lost Sanctuary</name>
		<desc>Long ago, humans and other creatures lived peacefully in a magical paradise. However, one day a new star appeared nearby. A meteorite fell onto the Earth, turning it into a realm of perpetual darkness and misery. Humans managed to restore the land to its original state. But orcs, trolls, and other hostile races refused to give up their territory. Thus, the second age of peace quickly turned into an age of a new battle...

Advanced Fantasian is a follow-up to Fantasian. Like its predecessor, it is a Western-style (despite its Japanese origins) role-playing game most closely resembling Wizardry games. Compared to the first game, it has enhanced visuals - graphical locations in the town as well as in the dungeon, as opposed to menus and vector graphics of the original. Gameplay system is more refined: the player can customize the characters' weapon proficiencies and a few skills.</desc>

A meteorite fell onto the Earth, turning it into a realm of perpetual darkness and misery. Humans managed to restore the land to its original state. But orcs, trolls, and other hostile races refused to give up their territory. Thus, the second age of peace quickly turned into an age of a new battle...

Advanced Fantasian is a follow-up to Fantasian. Like its predecessor, it is a Western-style (despite its Japanese origins) role-playing game most closely resembling Wizardry games. Compared to the first game, it has enhanced visuals - graphical locations in the town as well as in the dungeon, as opposed to menus and vector graphics of the original. Gameplay system is more refined: the player can customize the characters' weapon proficiencies and a few skills.</desc>

		<desc>Again is an interactive crime novel about FBI special agent Jonathan Weaver, nicknamed "J". He has a special power allowing him to look into the past. He is the lone survivor of an unsolved string of murders that happened 19 years ago in Clockford, Pennsylvania, wiping out most of his family. The killer left the piece of a dollar bill that is known as the "Eye of Providence" at each scene of crime, and when very similar events start to happen again J has to use his power to unravel the mystery. 

As with the other Cing games Hotel Dusk: Room 215 and Last Window: The Secret of Cape West the Nintendo DS is held sideways, like a book, during gameplay. Again uses realistic character depictions and full-motion video sequences. During conversations, one screen shows the character the player is talking to while the other is used to display clues and conversation topics. During investigations, J walks around 3-dimensional locations, controlled with the D-pad. On either screen is one version of the location, as it was in the past and as it is now. By pointing out the differences with the stylus, J gets flashbacks that show how that particular change took place, giving the player clues to what happened. This uses up psychic energy, displayed in a "psyche gauge" on screen. When the energy is depleted, the game is lost, so the player has to be careful when to use the special power. The energy automatically renews at the start of each day.</desc>

		<desc>The plot of this game is very simple: there is a big Expo in Japan, and the protagonist - working as a journalist for a company called "Oh!" (suspiciously similar to the company that designed this game) - must enter each pavilion and take pictures of the female models there. The trick is that the company is interested in erotic pictures of semi- or completely nude models, so the hero must use all his charm in order to convince the models to do so...

Alice-tachi no Gogo can be considered an adventure game with RPG angle. The main challenge of the game is to explore the huge, complex Expo area, finding people and items needed to gain access to new locations. However, there is also an RPG system in the game, even though many typical RPG elements (combat, equipment, etc.) are absent. The hero has a health bar, which is depleted whenever he tries to convince a girl to undress. In a sense, encounters with girls in the pavilions are equivalent to battles in other RPGs: some girls are too "strong", and the hero has to level up before he can "fight" them. Levels are gained by successfully undressing girls, which corresponds to the cornerstone of RPG gameplay: become stronger through experience.</desc>

		<desc>Alpha is an early game by  Square, that had started its existence as a developer of Japanese-only text adventures before it became famous for its  Final Fantasy series. Alpha describes the adventures of a female pilot whose space ship, the Daedalos, has crash-landed on an unknown planet. The interface is entirely text-based. Both the text messages displayed and the text input are in katakana (Japanese syllabic writing system). Several special commands can be accessed by pressing shortcut keys (Latin letters on the keyboard). The locations are displayed as still pictures above the text, same way as in Western interactive fiction games with graphics.</desc>

		<desc>Alphos is a basic vertically-scrolling shooter patterned after the 1982 Namco coin-op Xevious. Piloting the fighter craft Mnemonic, the player must fight back against the invading alien Alphos. Much like Namco's game, the player can shoot both air and ground targets separately, and there are many types of enemies and stationary targets in both planes. The game gives the player three lives and no continues, and can save high scores to disk.</desc>

		<name>Amazon Gakujutsu Tanken</name>
		<desc>Expedition Amazon puts you in control of a team of 4 explorers on an expedition to map and study (i.e.: plunder) the ruins of the Incan civilization. Your team consists of a Medic, a Field Assistant, a Radio Operator, and a Guard. After equipping your team with all the necessary supplies (don't forget the mosquito netting!) you travel to your base camp at the edge of the jungle where you will begin your journey.

You will quickly meet up with many of the hazards of the jungle as you explore, including hostile natives (hope your Guard is a good shot!), mosquitoes, disease, covered pits, wildlife, and more. Each of your team members has an "EL" rating which indicates how close he is to dying. Death comes quickly for new team members, but as your team gains experience by mapping more and more of the Amazon and Incan ruins, your EL rating goes up and your team members become quite a bit more effective at avoiding hazards.</desc>

		<desc>In a certain girls' high school, students have begun to mysteriously disappear. Authorities suggest that a secret society is at work. A spy needs to be sent in order to solve the mystery, and this mission falls into the hands of this game's hero. His boss explains to him that the quest is dangerous, indeed: many students associated with the mysterious cult have gone rampant and will attack any trespasser on sight!..nnThis simple story is the background for an simple RPG. The gameplay resembles that of "dungeon crawlers", meaning that there are no friendly areas; though the view for exploration is top-down rather than first-person (which is reserved for the turn-based battles). The gameplay mechanics are mostly confined to fighting random enemies and earning enough experience points to go up a level and standing a chance against the next "boss" enemy. There is no equipment system, and battle commands are restricted to "Attack", "Escape", and "Item".</desc>

His boss explains to him that the quest is dangerous, indeed: many students associated with the mysterious cult have gone rampant and will attack any trespasser on sight!..nnThis simple story is the background for an simple RPG. The gameplay resembles that of "dungeon crawlers", meaning that there are no friendly areas; though the view for exploration is top-down rather than first-person (which is reserved for the turn-based battles). The gameplay mechanics are mostly confined to fighting random enemies and earning enough experience points to go up a level and standing a chance against the next "boss" enemy. There is no equipment system, and battle commands are restricted to "Attack", "Escape", and "Item".</desc>

		<desc>Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as "active rail playing". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.</desc>

		<desc>The people of the kingdom Arkases have mastered the ways of magic, thanks to their connection to the world of spirits. However, the humans used their magical powers to wage war on each other and to disrupt the harmony. Finally, the Golden Dragon told the king of Arkases that his country will be punished for the deeds of the humans. Enter Jedah Chaf, a young man who has left his home village to fulfill his dream of becoming a knight. Will Jedah be able to save his country and to restore peace in the world?

Arcus is a RPG that is played entirely from first-person perspective. You navigate your hero by choosing a location from a menu. Once in dungeons, you have a separate menu whenever you encounter enemies. You fight them in turn-based combat, attacking physically or casting magic. The game is more close to Western RPG style than to Japanese one, and utilizes AD&amp;D terminology for character stats.</desc>

		<desc>The people of the kingdom Arkases have mastered the ways of magic, thanks to their connection to the world of spirits. However, the humans used their magical powers to wage war on each other and to disrupt the harmony. Finally, the Golden Dragon told the king of Arkases that his country will be punished for the deeds of the humans. Enter Jedah Chaf, a young man who has left his home village to fulfill his dream of becoming a knight. Will Jedah be able to save his country and to restore peace in the world?

Arcus is a RPG that is played entirely from first-person perspective. You navigate your hero by choosing a location from a menu. Once in dungeons, you have a separate menu whenever you encounter enemies. You fight them in turn-based combat, attacking physically or casting magic. The game is more close to Western RPG style than to Japanese one, and utilizes AD&amp;D terminology for character stats.</desc>

		<name>Argo</name>
		<desc>Loosely based on the Greek myth of the Argonauts, Argo focuses on its central protagonist Iason (Jason), narrating a simple story that does not quite correspond to the known myth: Iason's father has been poisoned, and his native city Iolkos overrun by monsters known as Pontos. Iason must single-handedly eliminate them and save his homeland.

Argo is a role-playing game set in a pseudo-3D continuous world. The player explores the environments from a first-person view. It is possible to try to talk to any encountered character, as well as attack anyone. Most battles take place within the exploration area and involve a fairly simple turn-based exchange of attacks. However, occasional fights against larger monsters take place on a separate screen, have an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective, and require the player to move and attack in real time. Experience points and gold are awarded for defeating enemies. It is necessary to feed the protagonist; when his condition is "hungry" food also restores a portion of his hit points.</desc>

		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<desc>Asteka might be a misspelling of Azteca, but it deals with the legacy of the Maya culture rather than the Aztecs. The player takes control of a nameless adventurer who travels to the town of Palenque in South Mexico. There, he has to visit various locations and talk to the local inhabitants in order to gain entrance to the ruins of an ancient Mayan temple, which supposedly harbors the deepest secrets of their civilization.

The game is a text adventure with graphics. The player switches between locations by typing words for "North", "South", etc., or simply by using the numeric arrow keys. The interaction with the environment is performed entirely by typing verb-object (or, rather, as the rules of Japanese grammar dictate, object-verb) command combinations. Text input and output are both in katakana only.</desc>

		<desc>The story of Taiyō no Shinden: Asteka II is dedicated to the Maya people, indigenous inhabitants of Southern Mexico and Central America, rather than the Aztecs. The player controls a nameless adventurer who searches for the Sun Key, a mysterious ancient artifact which can unlock the secrets of the Mayan civilization. Asteka II is an adventure game which takes place in the ruins of the ancient city Chichen Itza on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. There is a top-down overworld on which the player can physically navigate the protagonist, entering temples and other locations. In such locations, the view switches to first-person perspective. The player interacts with the environment by selecting various verb commands, represented by icons, from a menu, and combining them with objects on the screen. In spite of its Japanese origins, the game features inventory item usage and puzzle-solving, which are more typical of Western-style adventures.</desc>

Asteka II is an adventure game which takes place in the ruins of the ancient city Chichen Itza on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. There is a top-down overworld on which the player can physically navigate the protagonist, entering temples and other locations. In such locations, the view switches to first-person perspective. The player interacts with the environment by selecting various verb commands, represented by icons, from a menu, and combining them with objects on the screen. In spite of its Japanese origins, the game features inventory item usage and puzzle-solving, which are more typical of Western-style adventures.</desc>

		<desc>Aya-chan World is a simple top-down arcade-style racing game. The player controls a car, steering it through twisted, maze-like passages, adjusting the view so that the car always faces north. All the races are against time; if the player runs out of time allotted for the stage the game is over. Successfully making it to the finish line within the time limit, however, leads to erotic pictures of a young woman undressing and assuming sexual poses.</desc>

		<name>Ayumi</name>
		<desc>Ayumi had been an ordinary Japanese teenage girl - until one day, when summer vacation was just about to begin, a strange creature appeared and told her that a parallel world is in danger. Only Ayumi can stop the evil warlock Baram and his monster minions, since the inhabitants of the other world consider her a goddess incarnate.

Ayumi is an adventure game with comical and slight erotic undertones. Interaction with the environment is performed by selecting commands (such as Examine, Ask, Take etc.) from a menu. However, unlike most Japanese adventures, navigation is done in a RPG-like fashion on a top-down world map, with individual locations represented as icons. The game allows a considerable degree of exploration, though some areas are inaccessible until certain conditions are met. As opposed to most Japanese adventures, the story progresses by solving problems (which usually involves procuring items and using them in another context) rather then simply by triggering events. There are also a few puzzles in the game.</desc>

		<name>Ayumi</name>
		<desc>Ayumi had been an ordinary Japanese teenage girl - until one day, when summer vacation was just about to begin, a strange creature appeared and told her that a parallel world is in danger. Only Ayumi can stop the evil warlock Baram and his monster minions, since the inhabitants of the other world consider her a goddess incarnate.

Ayumi is an adventure game with comical and slight erotic undertones. Interaction with the environment is performed by selecting commands (such as Examine, Ask, Take etc.) from a menu. However, unlike most Japanese adventures, navigation is done in a RPG-like fashion on a top-down world map, with individual locations represented as icons. The game allows a considerable degree of exploration, though some areas are inaccessible until certain conditions are met. As opposed to most Japanese adventures, the story progresses by solving problems (which usually involves procuring items and using them in another context) rather then simply by triggering events. There are also a few puzzles in the game.</desc>

		<name>Back To The Future</name>
		<desc>In Back to the Future, 80s teen Marty McFly is mistakenly send 30 years into the past where he disrupts his own parents from meeting. Faced with extinction at the hands of a temporal paradox, Marty must find a way to reunite his future parents and make it back to his own time.

LJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.

Street running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).</desc>

		<name>Balance Of Power</name>
		<desc>The year is 1986. You take on the role of the US President or the Russian General Secretary. You have the full industrial capacity, covert forces, and military might of your country at your command. Your job? To make your country the world's most powerful and prestigious over the course of your eight years in office. Sounds easy, doesn't it? It would be if the other guy didn't have his finger poised over a red button that could wipe out the world!
You must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct military intervention to prop up third world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and his reaction.</desc>

		<name>Batten Tanuki No Daibouken</name>
		<desc>The story takes place in a forest, where the evil Count Wolf has kidnapped all of the creatures, save for an elderly rabbit. A tanuki warrior from outside the land, trained in kung-fu just happens to be passing through, so the rabbit granny begs him to use his strength to find Wolf Castle and rescue all of the villagers.

The game presents itself as a standard chop-socky side-scroller, as you pummel apes and flamingos and other woodland creatures. It's not immediately apparent, but the game world is quite large and complex, reportedly containing over 400 screens. The entire world is laid out on a grid, with several horizontal paths that are positioned parallel to each other. As you run across the levels, you'll find arrows that represent places where you can hop onto other areas.</desc>

		<desc>In Bishōjo shashinkan , your task is to photograph pretty girls in various situations. You are given a choice of point-and-shoot, single lens reflex and a pro camera. In order to get a real photograph, you must evaluate the lighting situation and subject and choose the correct shutter speed, film speed, aperture and whether to use flash or not. The choice of camera is also a choice of difficulty level. With a point-and-shoot, you need only get one variable right, whereas the pro camera requires you to set both aperture, shutter and film speed correctly. You are only given a few chances per shoot to get the right exposure, or you will just see a miscoloured picture flash briefly. Judging the exposure correctly grants you a picture of the girl, often in a surprising state of undressing, whereafter you progress to even more erotic poses. Later stages raise the difficulty level, forcing you to use the SLR, and later the meter-less pro camera.</desc>

		<desc>Rumor says that the legendary Black Onyx, an artifact that grants eternal youth and happiness to those who can find it, lies within the Black Tower near the town of Utsuro. You assemble a party of brave adventurers and venture into the tower, defeating monsters on your way to the great treasure.

The Black Onyx is one of the first traditional role-playing games made by a Japanese company. It is similar in gameplay to early Wizardry and Ultima games with killing monsters and exploring dungeons, with dark, realistic visuals. The player creates a party (up to five members) and explores a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on the way. The heroes also meet adventurers who can be convinced to join the party. The combat engine is turn-based.</desc>

		<desc>The Blade of Blackpoole is an illustrated text adventure with a medieval fantasy setting. Starting with only a pocket full of gold coins, the player's task is to recover the magical sword Myraglym, last seen near the lake at Blackpoole. On the way to the goal, there will be large forests, tricky swamps, a dangerous maze and high cliffs. Deadly creatures also abound, including a talking carnivorous plant, an aggressive lizardman and a hungry water beast. Some helpful characters may also be in the area. The game consists of around 60 locations, each with its own picture. Many of the characters in the game will pose riddles whose answer gives the clue on what they require so they help the player. The parser understands complex commands. There is an inventory limit, forcing the player to consider which items to take and which to leave or to drop once they are no longer needed. The game tracks the score up to a maximum of 500 points.</desc>

Starting with only a pocket full of gold coins, the player's task is to recover the magical sword Myraglym, last seen near the lake at Blackpoole. On the way to the goal, there will be large forests, tricky swamps, a dangerous maze and high cliffs. Deadly creatures also abound, including a talking carnivorous plant, an aggressive lizardman and a hungry water beast. Some helpful characters may also be in the area. The game consists of around 60 locations, each with its own picture. Many of the characters in the game will pose riddles whose answer gives the clue on what they require so they help the player. The parser understands complex commands. There is an inventory limit, forcing the player to consider which items to take and which to leave or to drop once they are no longer needed. The game tracks the score up to a maximum of 500 points.</desc>

		<desc>King Ogreth of the Basam Empire has invaded your country and either captured or turned into rocks and trees all your soldiers. You, king Suren, are left completely alone. In a desperate attempt, you decide to walk to king Ogreth's castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your soldiers back to you...

In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple – just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand.</desc>

		<desc>In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the current round and go onto the next one. This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.

In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.

The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</desc>

		<desc>The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. 

In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders.  There are 20 areas to be completed.

On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. The game also allows a second player to take control of Yamo.

There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.</desc>

		<name>Bug Attack</name>
		<desc>Bug Attack is a colorful shoot-em-up where you are assaulted by dagger-throwing millipedes, ants, and med flies. The game looks similar to the arcade game Centipede, but plays quite differently.

In the first waves, you are a spider in a desert surround by cacti. First the ants come at you, wandering back and forth randomly between the cacti and chucking daggers at you if you get under them. If you dispatch the ants, you get to fight the millipede, which advances row by row, not stopping for anything including the plants (or your spider). It also throws daggers from time to time as it advances. The third wave pits you against the deadly med flies, which dance in a line around the screen. If you don't shoot them fast enough, they start to break off from the group, dancing wildly and raining daggers down upon you.</desc>

		<desc>The evil god Daar was defeated long time ago. The difference races of Kypros could co-exist in peace. But Daar had followers, among them a powerful warrior named Bido. He intends to resurrect Daar and attack the king of Kypros. His minions attack three strongest knights who serve the king. But before he died, one of the knights released eight magical pearls. Each pearl can choose a hero, and eight heroes together would be able to stop Bido. Those heroes live in different places and belong to different races - humans, dragons, lizard-men, dog-like wosshus. Among them there are simple fighters, a thief, a powerful sorcerer. But they all know - the future of Kypros lies in their hands...</desc>

		<name>Burning Point</name>
		<desc>A young private detective named Mike Steel has opened a new office in Santa Chris, California. One day, a distinguished-looking elderly couple arranges an interview with him. It appears that their granddaughter is presumed dead, but the body has never been found. The couple hires Mike to search for the missing body; but as the detective begins to investigate the matter, he realizes that there is a much bigger conspiracy behind that.

Burning Point is a mystery-themed adventure game. The game does not have the usual set of simple verb commands with object lists, which is common for Japanese adventures. Instead, it offers specific options at each screen (though most of them repeat themselves as Mike goes about his investigation). The player has to interview suspects, unlock new locations (which, in their turn, deliver new suspects), as well as gather and examine evidence in order to advance the story and solve the case.</desc>

		<desc>The story of this game is simple. The protagonist is a lonely guy who constantly dreams about having a girlfriend but doesn't do anything to actually get one. One night, a fairy with bunny ears named Ariko appears in front of him and says she will fulfill one wish for him. Afterwards she simply guesses what the guy needs most badly: a girlfriend. So she gives him a magic book, which will give him information about five beautiful girls living somewhere in the city. With this book the hero's chances are increased. The quest for love begins!
The game plays like a standard Japanese adventure (still shots of locations, menu-based interface), with some additions. The hero can buy items and give them to girls as presents to impress them. The conversations with the girls involve going through several topics to find out what the girl likes. Once a girl seems to be "ready", it's possible to directly use commands such as "kiss the girl", "touch the girl" and more</desc>

		<desc>The second game in the Can Can Bunny series follows the story of a young Japanese boy named Takeshi. One fine night he looks out of the window and notices a sexy girl undressing in the opposite building. "Oh, if only I could get her", sighs Takeshi. Immediately, the kind bunny-eared fairy Ariko from the Magic Land appears and... grants Takeshi's wish! He now possesses a Magic Book that will teach him ho to conquer the hearts of pretty girls... and not just the hearts!
Compared to the first game, Can Can Bunny Superior plays more like a stereotypical Japanese adventure, without the complications of buying items and alike, and with simpler menu commands like "Look", "Move", etc. In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between different initial statistics for Takeshi, which will influence the difficulty of conquering a particular girl. The game itself is divided into three separate scenarios, with up to four different girls in each.</desc>

		<desc>The second game in the Can Can Bunny series follows the story of a young Japanese boy named Takeshi. One fine night he looks out of the window and notices a sexy girl undressing in the opposite building. "Oh, if only I could get her", sighs Takeshi. Immediately, the kind bunny-eared fairy Ariko from the Magic Land appears and... grants Takeshi's wish! He now possesses a Magic Book that will teach him ho to conquer the hearts of pretty girls... and not just the hearts!
Compared to the first game, Can Can Bunny Superior plays more like a stereotypical Japanese adventure, without the complications of buying items and alike, and with simpler menu commands like "Look", "Move", etc. In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between different initial statistics for Takeshi, which will influence the difficulty of conquering a particular girl. The game itself is divided into three separate scenarios, with up to four different girls in each.</desc>

		<name>Chack'n Pop</name>
		<desc>Chack'n Pop is considered  a predecessor of  Bubble Bobble. It is a platform game where a roundish yellow creature, named Chack'n, must fight against Monstas and Mightas in order to reclaim hearts that were stolen during a romantic encounter with Miss Chack'n.

The Monstas themselves hatch from eggs hanging from the ceilings and the Mightas push a rock that is used as the game's timer. The Monsta eggs have three phases:  if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an egg turns red it will pop almost immediately.

Chack'n uses bombs to blow up the Monstas and their eggs and he also uses them to release the captured hearts from their cages. When the heart is released, it will fly up and destroy the separator block and reveal the exit to the level.

Most versions of the game contain 14 levels to play through, however the Famicom version only includes 9.</desc>

		<name>Chack'n Pop</name>
		<desc>Chack'n Pop is considered  a predecessor of  Bubble Bobble. It is a platform game where a roundish yellow creature, named Chack'n, must fight against Monstas and Mightas in order to reclaim hearts that were stolen during a romantic encounter with Miss Chack'n.

The Monstas themselves hatch from eggs hanging from the ceilings and the Mightas push a rock that is used as the game's timer. The Monsta eggs have three phases:  if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an egg turns red it will pop almost immediately.

Chack'n uses bombs to blow up the Monstas and their eggs and he also uses them to release the captured hearts from their cages. When the heart is released, it will fly up and destroy the separator block and reveal the exit to the level.

Most versions of the game contain 14 levels to play through, however the Famicom version only includes 9.</desc>

		<desc>One day, a lone traveler came from the desert to a small camp. There, he sat down, weary from his long travel, enjoying a short rest. "Have you heard of the Tower of Ouroboros"? - asked him a bearded old man who was sitting nearby. - "A legend says that if fulfills all your wishes. Many heroes tried their luck there. None has returned. Dangers lure at every corner in the tower, deadly enchantresses who will bring demise on anyone daring to set his foot there". Without answering, the young traveler left the camp, and soon he was standing at the tower gate...nnChaos Angels is a semi-erotic RPG similar to the first two Dragon Knight games. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. You gradually explore the huge 3D dungeon, the Tower of Ouroboros, fighting enemies and gaining experience points.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2300, mankind has finally united, creating a federation government on the Earth and dedicating efforts and resources to space travel. Humans have spread to distant planets, only to face the gravest danger of all: a mysterious alien race that utilizes the newest robotic technology to destroy humanity. The special team Rayieza was stationed on Mars; after an alien assault, only one member, Blue, has survived. The protagonist's orders are to team up with Blue and safely return to Earth, which sounds much easier than it is in reality... One of Enix's early RPGs, Chikyū Senshi Rayieza has several distinguishing features. Unlike most RPGs, where the heroes explore the world on foot, in this game the player is mostly confined to the space ship; movement between planets is performed by selecting the appropriate menu command. Each flight between planets takes time; enemies would pop out randomly and attack the crew.</desc>

		<desc>Choplifter! is a side-scrolling action/arcade game that puts you in command of an attack chopper. Your mission: Go behind enemy lines and rescue up to 16 hostages per level. Be careful, though, because tanks and enemy aircraft will try to stop you - and they won't stop shooting while you are rescuing those hostages!

Originally released for Apple II home computers, Choplifter! was later ported to the arcades and a number of video game consoles. Many imitators and homages would follow.</desc>

		<desc>A young girl was enjoying a happy life with her boyfriend when suddenly, a powerful spell was cast and the poor boy was turned into stone. A sorceress named Christine appears and says that another sorceress called Jane was the culprit. The young heroine must find a way to defeat Jane and revert her boyfriend to normal.
Christine is a Japanese-style adventure taking place in a fantasy world. Screen-by-screen navigation is done with arrow keys. Every screen offers a few commands, mostly allowing to talk to the character present or sometimes perform other actions . The player has to complete certain task and acquire specific items to be able to defeat Jane. It is also possible to attempt this at an earlier moment, but the result in that case is Game Over.
With the exception of her boyfriend, all the characters in the game are female. The game features scenes with explicit sexual situations as well as torture and violence.</desc>

		<name>Columns</name>
		<desc>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</desc>

		<name>Combat</name>
		<desc>Loosely based on the tank portion of the Atari 2600 cart that originally came packed with the console, Combat brings tank warfare into 3D.  There is both a single player mode, in which the player must advance through 30 levels, and multi-player mode, which allows deathmatch style play.

Just as in the Atari 2600 game, the tanks' turrets do not turn.  However, the tanks turn quicker and hover, rather than relying on treads.  This allows them to slide left and right, as well as forward and back.

In single player mode, the player must find the exit in each level to advance.  The levels range from the simple "shoot and destroy until the exit appears" to the complicated "journey back and forth destroying the enemies required to open gates."  There are also levels in which a "boss" must be defeated to advance.

Multiplayer mode supports play over a LAN or the Internet.  The CD-ROM also includes the GameSpy Arcade software if you wish to use it for Internet play.

The CD-ROM also includes a map editor, although it is officially unsupported.</desc>

		<name>Cosmic Soldier</name>
		<desc>The year is 3530 AD. The KGD (an obvious nod to the developer  Kogado) Star System has fallen into the clutches of the evil Quila Empire. The hero of the game is a soldier of the Galactic Alliance who receives a mission to infiltrate a Quila base with his companion, a beautiful female android, and eventually defeat the enemy. 

Cosmic Soldier is an early Japan-made RPG, which still mostly follows the  Wizardry template, being a dungeon crawler with first-person navigation. Random enemy encounters lead to simple turn-based battles, graphically displayed at the top of the screen. The player cannot assign individual commands to the party members, but is able to choose various types of elemental attacks, which have different effects on different enemies.

An original gameplay element is the ability to have short conversation with some enemies. It is possible to convince the enemy to join the party; this feature predates the famous demon conversations from  Megaten games.</desc>

		<name>Crimson</name>
		<desc>Crimson is a medieval-themed role-playing game similar to Dragon Quest. The player controls a lone character, a young man whose father sent him on a mission to defeat the evil monster Crimson before passing away. Exploration is done in an overhead fashion, and is divided into world map and hostile areas, which are usually maze-like and contain one or more dungeons each. In towns the hero can buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as rest in inns.

Enemies appear randomly, and the battles are turn-based. The player character can either attack, defend, or use an item. Combat is viewed from a first-person perspective. Unlike Dragon Quest, there are no random encounters on the world map. Exploration is non-linear, i.e. the player has access to many areas of the map from the beginning of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Crimson is a medieval-themed role-playing game similar to Dragon Quest. The player controls a lone character, a young man whose father sent him on a mission to defeat the evil monster Crimson before passing away. Exploration is done in an overhead fashion, and is divided into world map and hostile areas, which are usually maze-like and contain one or more dungeons each. In towns the hero can buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as rest in inns.

Enemies appear randomly, and the battles are turn-based. The player character can either attack, defend, or use an item. Combat is viewed from a first-person perspective. Unlike Dragon Quest, there are no random encounters on the world map. Exploration is non-linear, i.e. the player has access to many areas of the map from the beginning of the game.</desc>

The sequel to Crimson retains the basic gameplay of its predecessor and is a medieval-themed role-playing game with aerial exploration and first-person turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies. The first part of the game is divided into chapters, each dedicated to one of the five heroes, after which they are reunited as a group and continue the quest together, as in Dragon Quest IV.</desc>

		<desc>Angelo is a young man who had to leave his homeland and is now wandering the world, looking for adventure. One day he arrives in a town populated only by women. Brutal assassins attack the town, but Angelo swiftly deals with them. The head priestess of the town thanks him and explains that peace can be restored only if the two goddesses who protect the land will return. It appears that the goddesses were captured, so our hero decides to find them and bring them back.
Crystal Dream is a solo turn-based RPG with a very basic combat system. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. Navigation is performed by pressing directional arrow keys, which takes the player character from one still screen to another. At every screen, it is possible to "camp" (which opens inventory and equipment menu), as well as look around and talk to people - or attack if an enemy appears. There is also the possibility to directly have sex at any moment.</desc>

		<name>Crystal Dream 2 - Maou no Gen'ei</name>
		<desc>Once upon a time, there was harmony and balance in the beautiful land of Yugrena. Sky, earth, sea, and man co-existed in peace. But human beings began to exploit the nature for their own needs. The balance was broken. Dark clouds covered the sky; the earth quaked in anger; the sea began to send waves of destruction. Only one man can restore the balance in the world - the legendary hero Grey. Blessed by his wise master, Grey ventures to Yugrena to correct the wrongs.</desc>

		<name>Crystal Prison</name>
		<desc>Crystal Prison is an adventure game utilizing a text parser that takes place on an isolated island. Mike Morrow woke up surrounded by 6 people with no memories except for one: being beaten up by a criminal that was looking for a crystal. Before being able to answer any questions, he was injected by a doctor and fell asleep. Having lost all his memories, is there anyone whom Mike can really trust?

Players control Mike after waking up and find themselves in a villa. Any action is done by inputting text in Japanese or English. Mike can pick up and use objects and search his surroundings to find more items. Being an early adventure game, the game gives players too much freedom and is considered difficult due to the large amount of items the players can pick up and find no use for. There are numerous ways for the protagonist to die, such as being shot, stabbed, strangled, bitten by a dog, eaten by a shark, falling from the second floor.</desc>

		<name>Cygnus</name>
		<desc>Cygnus is a game where the player needs to navigate mazes, with a look inspired by Gravitar and Thrust. Players guide a space ship drawn as a triangle through minimalistic levels that usually only consist of lines to mark the borders. The ship cannot touch any of the lines or it explodes. The ship can be rotated in any direction and as most levels have no gravity, thrust is used to gain speed or slow down (facing the opposing direction). When the ship is blown up, it immediately respawns.

The game also introduces fuel. Each thrust depletes the amount of fuel and it needs to be refilled by flying close to tanks. When out of fuel the ship eventually crashes into a border. When it respawns it starts off with a new amount. The game is divided into different planets, each with a distinct look. Hazards include obstacles and moving objects. The ship cannot shoot. Later environments also have teleporters and minor puzzles where the ship needs to fly through a certain section to remove a barrier.</desc>

		<name>D'</name>
		<desc>The story begins in 1997. It's the dead of night in the city of Los Angeles, and there has been a mass murder at a general hospital on the outskirts of downtown. The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.

D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</desc>

		<desc>Daisenryaku 88 is a PC-88-exclusive installment of the turn-based war strategy series. The core mechanics are similar to those of Gendai Daisenryaku: there are two belligerents in every scenario, "blue" and "red" (though they can be renamed by the player). The game includes a dozen maps with varied types of locations and terrains (islands, deserts, mountains, etc.). Many of these maps based on real-world locations (e.g. Europe, China and Korea, etc.), though without any specific dates or pre-history given, and always with contemporary weapons and vehicles. A map editor is also included.

Like in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Production costs money, and fuel has to be delivered to the units regularly with supply trucks. Participants then navigate their units on a hex-based grid, trying to occupy cities and airports on the way for strategic advantage.</desc>

		<desc>David's Midnight Magic is a simple pinball game designed for 1-4 players. The game was modeled on the popular Black Knight pinball table released by Williams. Unlike Black Knight, however, David's Midnight Magic contains a mixture of bright colors. Featuring dual flipper controls, upper and lower playing fields, tilt mechanism, multiple ball play, electromagnetic deflectors, and many special effects, the game represents the first generation of home computer pinball simulations available with relatively realistic pinball features.</desc>

		<desc>Once upon a time, a demon called Sharudo came to Fairy's land, creating havoc. He built a monster town on a mountain top and dwelled there, ruling over the land below.
One day, Sharudo came and took princess Chris to his monster lair. Now it's up to Ares, a brave soldier in the service of the Fairies, to save Chris.

Demon Crystal is an action puzzle game. Scattered around the stage are numerous keys which help open locked areas. The goal is to find the big key which is needed to open the exit and advance to the next stage. Ares' only weapon is a limited number of bombs, which explode in a flame and can kill multiple enemies at once. The game consists of 30 stages (houses).</desc>

		<desc>Dezeni Land is a text adventure with graphics. The game's nameless protagonist must visit six attractions parodying well-known areas of Tokyo Disneyland of the early 1980's, find the treasures within and escape. The title itself is a pun involving Disney and a Japanese expression referring showing off one's wealth. The gameplay largely follows the standards of interactive fiction, including simple verb-noun combinations as well as directions (forward, back, left, and right) for navigation. The areas are accessed in a linear fashion; items needed to advance to the next attraction can only be founded in an earlier explored location.</desc>

		<desc>Dezeni World is a sequel to Dezeni Land. Like its predecessor, it is set in a theme park, this time with a broader range of parodies. Featuring a warning "For Crazy People Only" on the cover, the game casts the player into the role of one Dezeni-Man, a rather unremarkably-looking character who nevertheless must defeat the nefarious supercomputer HAL3. On his way he encounters various eccentric people, including popular comic book characters such as Superman, a robot bearing a strong resemblance to C-3PO from Star Wars, etc. 

Gameplay-wise, it is very similar to the previous title. The player moves from screen to screen with key abbreviations representing the four directions, and interacts with the environment by typing combinations of verbs and nouns. The game is fairly simple and develops in a comparatively linear fashion, with only a few items needed to access the next area, and puzzles mostly involving talking to people or using the right item at the right place.</desc>

		<name>Diablo</name>
		<desc>Long ago a secret war raged between Heaven and Hell, each using humanity as its pawns. While the Prime Evils of Hell were engaged in war their lesser lieutenants conspired to overthrow them. They mutinied suddenly with the combined forces of Hell, overwhelming the three Primes. Stripped of their power, they were banished to the mortal realm. Human agents of Heaven, upon discovering this, found the three Primes and sealed them within gemstone prisons, each of them sent to a different corner of the earth and kept under guard to prevent them from escaping.

As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven's agents waned, until eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of the land's good king, driving him to attack his neighbors. The nation of Khanduras fought wars with no intention of winning, desiring only slaughter and suffering. Now the lands lay scorched, home only to monsters and the dead. Rumors spread of a way to stop the demons, as well as rumors of great wealth, and both draw adventurers from far to the small town of Tristram.

Players start by choosing their avatar's class: either Warrior, Rogue, or Sorcerer. Warriors have the highest maximum strength and can repair weapons and armor inside the dungeon, but this will lower the item's maximum durability. The Rogue has the highest maximum dexterity and can both see and disarm traps on treasure chests. The Sorcerer has the highest maximum magic attribute and can recharge the charges on a spellcasting staff at the cost of his own mana.

Characters can equip armor, weapons, and accessories found in the chapel's shifting dungeons, but strong equipment will have minimum attribute requirements to be worn. Most equipment will have randomized stats, but some strong monsters will drop Unique weapons with set stats. Magic can be learned by finding magic tomes, and leveled up by finding multiples of the same spell tome, but advanced spell levels can not be learned if the character's magic stat is too low. Upon destroying enough monsters to level up the player is rewarded with additional attribute points to distribute to whichever attributes they wish. Occasionally the few people left in town will inform the player of a job they would like done, either an exceptionally strong monster that must be slain or a unique item found deep in the dungeon, and will reward the player in kind upon completion of the quest.

Diablo can be played cooperatively with 1 to 3 other players over LAN or BattleNet with the PC versions, or with 1 player locally on the PlayStation. Players can team up to survive the depths of the dungeons, or turn on each other to steal one another's items from their corpse. The quest unique zones are removed from the online version of a dungeon, and instead quest monsters will be found wandering the level that would normally lead to their unique area.</desc>

		<desc>Long ago a secret war raged between Heaven and Hell, each using humanity as its pawns. While the Prime Evils of Hell were engaged in war their lesser lieutenants conspired to overthrow them. They mutinied suddenly with the combined forces of Hell, overwhelming the three Primes. Stripped of their power, they were banished to the mortal realm. Human agents of Heaven, upon discovering this, found the three Primes and sealed them within gemstone prisons, each of them sent to a different corner of the earth and kept under guard to prevent them from escaping.

As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven's agents waned, until eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of the land's good king, driving him to attack his neighbors. The nation of Khanduras fought wars with no intention of winning, desiring only slaughter and suffering. Now the lands lay scorched, home only to monsters and the dead. Rumors spread of a way to stop the demons, as well as rumors of great wealth, and both draw adventurers from far to the small town of Tristram.

Players start by choosing their avatar's class: either Warrior, Rogue, or Sorcerer. Warriors have the highest maximum strength and can repair weapons and armor inside the dungeon, but this will lower the item's maximum durability. The Rogue has the highest maximum dexterity and can both see and disarm traps on treasure chests. The Sorcerer has the highest maximum magic attribute and can recharge the charges on a spellcasting staff at the cost of his own mana.

Characters can equip armor, weapons, and accessories found in the chapel's shifting dungeons, but strong equipment will have minimum attribute requirements to be worn. Most equipment will have randomized stats, but some strong monsters will drop Unique weapons with set stats. Magic can be learned by finding magic tomes, and leveled up by finding multiples of the same spell tome, but advanced spell levels can not be learned if the character's magic stat is too low. Upon destroying enough monsters to level up the player is rewarded with additional attribute points to distribute to whichever attributes they wish. Occasionally the few people left in town will inform the player of a job they would like done, either an exceptionally strong monster that must be slain or a unique item found deep in the dungeon, and will reward the player in kind upon completion of the quest.

Diablo can be played cooperatively with 1 to 3 other players over LAN or BattleNet with the PC versions, or with 1 player locally on the PlayStation. Players can team up to survive the depths of the dungeons, or turn on each other to steal one another's items from their corpse. The quest unique zones are removed from the online version of a dungeon, and instead quest monsters will be found wandering the level that would normally lead to their unique area.</desc>

		<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>

		<name>Digital Devil Story Megami Tensei</name>
		<desc>A high-school student and skillful computer programmer named Akemi Nakajima created a software called "Devil Summoning Program". At first Nakajima intended to use the software to gain revenge on a classmate who bullied him. However, things went out of control, and the malicious demon Loki was unleashed into the world. Soon, a demonic invasion of the Earth began. Aided by the lovely Yumiko Shirasagi, a transfer student who seems to be interested in him, Nakajima decides to undo his wrongs and defeat the demons. In order to do that, the young couple will need to learn how to use the program for good purposes, and uncover the truth about their own previous incarnations. 

Based on a series of horror novels by the Japanese author Aya Nishitani (the first of which is named Digital Devil Story), Megami Tensei (translated as "Goddess Reincarnation") marks the birth of the eponymous role-playing franchise. The game is a first-person RPG with turn-based combat, set entirely in large, maze-like dungeon areas. Unlike in most Japanese-style RPGs, the player can manually increase combat parameters of Nakajima and Yumiko when they gain a level. 

The game introduces the demon summoning feature that has since become the distinguishing gameplay element of the series. The player is able to communicate with randomly encountered demons through Nakajima's computer software, summon them, and make them fight as members of the controlled party. Communications with randomly encountered demons usually involve offering them money or magnetite (energy they consume); the outcome of the communication depends on the demon's race, alignment, and the phase of the moon. Demons can also be "fused" with each other in special facilities, creating more powerful species.</desc>

At first Nakajima intended to use the software to gain revenge on a classmate who bullied him. However, things went out of control, and the malicious demon Loki was unleashed into the world. Soon, a demonic invasion of the Earth began. Aided by the lovely Yumiko Shirasagi, a transfer student who seems to be interested in him, Nakajima decides to undo his wrongs and defeat the demons. In order to do that, the young couple will need to learn how to use the program for good purposes, and uncover the truth about their own previous incarnations. 

Based on a series of horror novels by the Japanese author Aya Nishitani (the first of which is named Digital Devil Story), Megami Tensei (translated as "Goddess Reincarnation") marks the birth of the eponymous role-playing franchise. The game is a first-person RPG with turn-based combat, set entirely in large, maze-like dungeon areas. Unlike in most Japanese-style RPGs, the player can manually increase combat parameters of Nakajima and Yumiko when they gain a level. 

The game introduces the demon summoning feature that has since become the distinguishing gameplay element of the series. The player is able to communicate with randomly encountered demons through Nakajima's computer software, summon them, and make them fight as members of the controlled party. Communications with randomly encountered demons usually involve offering them money or magnetite (energy they consume); the outcome of the communication depends on the demon's race, alignment, and the phase of the moon. Demons can also be "fused" with each other in special facilities, creating more powerful species.</desc>

		<desc>Ash is a young mercenary who emerges victorious in every battle. But he doesn't know why luck is always with him; he also doesn't know why he is sometimes haunted by ghosts who call him "Death God Ash", and why mysterious butterflies appear in front of him and guide him to his next destination. The latest "butterfly assignment" was to go to the kingdom of Zamhan and to follow the mayor's order. Will Ash finally find out the true answers to his mysterious destiny?

Dinosaur combines characteristic features of both Western and Japanese RPGs. Typically for the latter genre, the player is unable to create a party of adventurers; characters with their own backgrounds join Ash as dictated by the plot. However, the fully 3D first-person navigation is reminiscent of Western RPGs such as the  Wizardry series. The enemies appear randomly and are fought in turn-based combat. The party can rest at any time, restoring health and technique points. There is no auto-map feature; only the compass aids the player when navigating the maze-like dungeons of the game.</desc>

However, the fully 3D first-person navigation is reminiscent of Western RPGs such as the  Wizardry series. The enemies appear randomly and are fought in turn-based combat. The party can rest at any time, restoring health and technique points. There is no auto-map feature; only the compass aids the player when navigating the maze-like dungeons of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Ash is a young mercenary who emerges victorious in every battle. But he doesn't know why luck is always with him; he also doesn't know why he is sometimes haunted by ghosts who call him "Death God Ash", and why mysterious butterflies appear in front of him and guide him to his next destination. The latest "butterfly assignment" was to go to the kingdom of Zamhan and to follow the mayor's order. Will Ash finally find out the true answers to his mysterious destiny?

		<name>Dome</name>
		<desc>DOME is based on Shizuko Natsuki's novel of the same name. The original work as well as the game's plot focus on the construction of a nuclear shelter called "The Dome", capable of protecting humans from an impending atomic war. The player takes the role of an employee in an advertisement company, whose job is to raise people's awareness of the shelter's importance, and donate money to the project.

The game opens System Sacom's Novel Ware series, demonstrating its concept. Though its basic gameplay is that of a puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure, the game has extended dialogue and text descriptions that either do not contain any interaction or occasionally prompt the player to make a choice. Despite this visual novel-like feature, the game still retains considerable portions of interactivity, with verb-object commands, reviewing information concerning recent events and characters in the game, and even the possibility to take and examine objects. The game's graphics consist of digitized photos of people and objects, and are rather sparse.</desc>

		<name>Don Juan</name>
		<desc>Don Juan challenges the player to reach the fame of the legendary seducer of women. There are five girls to seduce:
a dynamic redhead;
a mysterious brunette;
a night-loving brunette;
a volcanic brunette;
a voluptuous blonde.
The player starts with 1200 pounds (or 9000 francs) of wealth and 0 points on the lovometer. To increase the lovometer's score, the player must enter single keywords (verbs in infinitive). Each word represents an idea, enabling player to tell the lady about himself, pay her compliments, or make suggestions. Which words are successful depends on the girl's character. Several keywords lead to menus to specify the idea more precisely (for example, 5 menu items representing locations with different prices are shown on the word TRIP). The girl's reaction to a keyword is shown through her facial expression (smile, wink, kiss, etc.). 

But seducing is not easy, because certain rules are in effect and unforeseen events can occur. The same word cannot be entered more than 3 times if it was used successfully, nor can the player see the sub-menus more than 3 times. An unsuccessful word may become successful later, however. Entering HELP or WORDS gives hints and a list of the game's vocabulary, but a fee must be paid for their use.
 
Among the possible events are the appearance of a rival who steals the player's beloved. In addition, some tragic event may occur with the girl, such as her dog being eaten by bigger one, an acne attack, a toothache, losing her job, etc. In this case, the player should cheer her up with the right keyword.

There are 3 difficulty levels. The player wins if he obtains a score of 500 for level 1, 700 for level 2, and 800 for level 3.</desc>

Among the possible events are the appearance of a rival who steals the player's beloved. In addition, some tragic event may occur with the girl, such as her dog being eaten by bigger one, an acne attack, a toothache, losing her job, etc. In this case, the player should cheer her up with the right keyword.

There are 3 difficulty levels. The player wins if he obtains a score of 500 for level 1, 700 for level 2, and 800 for level 3.</desc>

		<desc>Dojin Kaizokuban is an unofficial text-mode remake of Truxton. It includes many recognizable elements from the original game, including the three types of weapons, enemy patterns, and even the large bosses that can be destroyed piece-by-piece, all rendered in chunky blue-and-white text. Just as the original game, there are three weapon types, each of them upgradable, as well as screen-clearing bombs (which look like flashing skulls), and multiple stages each with a boss at the end. The game also features a bizarre running commentary on the side of the screen by a square-headed face.</desc>

		<name>Dragon</name>
		<desc>Dragon is an action-puzzle game with an Oriental theme, based on the Ballistic concept. A dragon, made of a chain of colored marbles is moving along a curved track towards a temple. You must shoot colored marbles from your cannon at the bottom of the screen (which can move left and right) to prevent the dragon from reaching the temple (if it does, you lose a life); when you shoot a marble into the dragon, it becomes a part of it (replacing the marble that was there before), and if at least three same-colored marbles are next to each other, they disappear, possibly also causing neighboring marble groups to vanish. As you keep destroying the marbles, a bar at the top of the screen slowly fills itself; once it is filled completely, the level is finished. 

Power-ups, coins and bonuses fall occasionally from the destroyed marbles. Coins give you additional lives when you collect enough. Power-ups have a lot of various effects - slowing the dragon down, allowing you to shoot a destructive lightning beam, and more. Bonuses simply give you score. 

By achieving some difficult feats (like completing several levels without losing a life) you earn trophies which you can later view in your trophy room.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Buster</name>
		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Dragon Buster is an action platform game composed out of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. The player's goal in every level is to reach the final stage where the protagonist faces the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, the player character moves through platform stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since it is impossible to heal between the stages. The hero's life meter (called "vitality" in the game) is the first introduction of such a feature to action games.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Eyes - The Space Opera Dragon Eyes</name>
		<desc>Dragon Eyes is a "space opera" kind of story, focusing on a young girl named Ines, who lives on the planet Miu of the Phi Sun. She grew up together with a space agent named Klind, to whom she refers as "brother". One day, her superior from the planet Garudoria informs her that Klind has disappeared during one of his missions and might be in danger. Ines travels to Garudoria to find additional information, and soon becomes involved in a vast space conflict...

Dragon Eyes plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, with commands such as Examine, Talk, Think, and Move appearing on every screen. Choosing one of those commands usually leads into a sub-menu of objects. There is also limited usage of items, which is sometimes required in order to advance in the game.

There are a few scenes with graphical nudity, but no explicit sex scenes.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Eyes - The Space Opera Dragon Eyes</name>
		<desc>Dragon Eyes is a "space opera" kind of story, focusing on a young girl named Ines, who lives on the planet Miu of the Phi Sun. She grew up together with a space agent named Klind, to whom she refers as "brother". One day, her superior from the planet Garudoria informs her that Klind has disappeared during one of his missions and might be in danger. Ines travels to Garudoria to find additional information, and soon becomes involved in a vast space conflict...

Dragon Eyes plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, with commands such as Examine, Talk, Think, and Move appearing on every screen. Choosing one of those commands usually leads into a sub-menu of objects. There is also limited usage of items, which is sometimes required in order to advance in the game.

There are a few scenes with graphical nudity, but no explicit sex scenes.</desc>

		<desc>Strawberry Fields was once a peaceful land. Ruled by the lovely queen Luna and populated only by women, the country knew no trouble. The Goddess Tower protected the inhabitants of Strawberry Fields. But recently, something happened in the tower. It is said that a dragon descended upon it, spawning an army of dragon knights who were threatening the peaceful land. The queen Luna summons you, a wandering adventurer, to descend into the depth of the Goddess Tower and to purge the evil from the land.

Dragon Knight marked the beginning of Elf's erotic RPG series. The game is played entirely from a first-person perspective. In the town, you move around by selecting destinations from a menu. Once you enter the tower, you navigate your character through 3D mazes, fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. Enemies in the game are scantily clad, attractive young women; there are also several scenes with explicit nudity.</desc>

		<desc>Strawberry Fields - a magic country populated almost exclusively by beautiful young girls (that is, if we don't count the Wise Old Man and a couple of other male exceptions). All went well in this peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might know as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful!</desc>

		<name>Dragon Slayer</name>
		<desc>Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG genre. The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and "bump" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.
The player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive.</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes tells the story of a young prince named Selios. One day, his old teacher Raiyas sends him to a nearby cave to retrieve a magical weapon. When the prince returns, he finds the house under attack by monsters. Raiyas tells him to seek help in the castle of a baron, whose country has long been allied with theirs. However, the baron betrays Selios' trust and imprisons him. The young prince manages to escape, but with no way back, he has no choice but to wander around the country, trying to find trustworthy companions who would help him save his country.nnnnThis is a traditional Japanese RPG, with turn-based combat, viewed from the first person perspective. Enemies are semi-random: they appear out of nowhere, but they are visible on the screen, and if you run away from a battle, they will chase you.</desc>

Dragoon Armor for Adult is a very basic first-person dungeon crawler, with vector graphics (like in early  Wizardry games), but without party members; Landis explores the similarly-looking mazes (no auto-map feature) all by himself, fighting randomly appearing enemies in simple turn-based combat. It is possible to buy weapons, armor, and items outside, but there are no other locations to access beside the tower. Event cut-scenes may feature nudity, but no "hardcore" sexual situations.</desc>

It is possible to buy weapons, armor, and items outside, but there are no other locations to access beside the tower. Event cut-scenes may feature nudity, but no "hardcore" sexual situations.</desc>

		<desc>Duel! is a two-player board game. Each player has a number of pieces, one of which is a king. The goal is to either remove the other player's king from play or move your own king into the other king's starting position. Pieces have numbers that indicate the number of tiles they can move each turn. Unlike chess, all pieces can move in any direction and even change direction during a turn, but they can only change direction once. It's only possible to capture other pieces on the last move of a sequence.</desc>

		<desc>Duet is a fast-paced game about avoiding shapes through rotation similar in concept to a title like Super Hexagon. You control two circles at the bottom of the screen (red and blue) bound by a ring. Touching left or right rotates the ring accordingly. This technique is used to avoid shapes that appear from the top of the screen, quickly rotating left and right to make sure the red and blue circles do no touch them. Levels are fairly short, but a single hit means you start again from the beginning.

The game is split up in nine sets of levels named after the Kübler-Ross stages of grief and a few other themes. Levels are unlocked gradually and a green icon appears when a level is completed in one go without dying. By completing sets of levels additional modes can be unlocked, such as an endless mode with multiple lives, a daily challenge with different waves, and 48 new stages grouped together as an epilogue chapter. Between levels messages often appear as well as voiced lines.</desc>

		<desc>A bunch of university kids at MIT (soon to be the guiding lights behind Infocom) played the pioneering cave-crawling treasure-hunting text adventure ADVENTURE and thought "Hey, we can improve on that!"  Around June of 1977 they pooled their collected creative juices and cranked out a sassy successor in MDL on a PDP-10.  It didn't have a name, so they just used a hacker nonsense word in place of one temporarily -- "Zork."

This game presented the next in a long line of treasure-hunting protagonists with a vast Great Underground Empire to explore -- provided their lantern didn't run out of juice -- and whimsical obstacles among the Flatheadian ruins forced players to employ lateral thinking to collect wondrous treasures worth thousands of zorkmids... and deposit them in the trophy case back aboveground.  If this sounds familiar, it's no coincidence -- Zork/Dungeon is the primordial clay from which the first three games of the Zork series were fashioned, following some extensive refitting of set pieces -- due to the game's enormous size of one megabyte, making it commercially available for home microcomputers, with their limited memory and storage capabilities, was not considered a viable plan in 1979... until they came up with the idea of segmenting the giant dungeon up.

(Ports of this game also exist for VMS, the Acorn Archimedes, and the Z-code, TADS and GLK software platforms.)</desc>

		<name>Eggy</name>
		<desc>EGGY is an action game that won the Excellence Award at Bothtec's first programming contest and was inspired by Choplifter. In this game players take the role of Ena, a robot which has to collect goods that are dropped from the sky with parachutes.

The robot has a limited fuel supply that decreases with time and every time the robot takes damage from the enemies. The fuel supply can be replenished by saving humans that were transformed into killer cyborgs.

The robot can only shoot diagonally after jumping and the location of the enemies, as well as the goods are indicated on a small map in the bottom.

To complete each level, players need to collect a set amount of goods indicated at the top-right part of the screen.</desc>

		<desc>A young Japanese man receives an unexpected call from his friend Akira in the middle of the night. He hurries to Akira's house, only to find him dead under unclear circumstances. Checking out his computer files reveals information about his sister, who was allegedly kidnapped. The trail leads to the mysterious land of El Dorado in South America, populated by tribes of Amazonekos ("Amazon cats"), who look like young attractive human females with cat tails. In order to solve the mystery, the hero must find a way to view tattoos adorning various body parts of the young ladies.

El Dorado Denki is a first-person Japanese-style adventure with several distinguishing features. Like most games of the genre, it contains only a few inventory-based tasks, and relies mostly on advancing a linear plot by selecting a verb from a menu and using it on an on-screen object or character.</desc>

		<desc>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.

Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them: shooting them with his gun, kicking them by jumping onto them, shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them and crushing them with an elevator.

Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.</desc>

		<desc>On the continent of Gaia, Böser, the King of the East, is raising an army of dark creatures. King Sieghart of Elthlead, champion of light, must muster his own troops in order to stop him from ruling the world.
After booting up the game, you are given the option to load a previous save. If you don't, you are immediately faced with the world map, where Böser starts moving his troops from his castle to any adjacent province. Once he is done, it is your turn. You first get to buy a unit or two that you can place on your castle. You then move any unit you want to a neighbouring province. After that comes the magic phase, where you can cast spells to give your troops an advantage, like summoning a mighty white dragon that will participate in one fight before disappearing, or hinder those of your AI opponent, even forcibly moving one of his units to another province. The number of magic points available to you depends on the number of ruins you control.</desc>

		<desc>Somewhere in the galaxy, there is a planet named Sera. It is protected by a wall of energy which its inhabitants call "Force". The Force is sustained by magical crystals known as seeds. When demons begin to invade the planet, the task of the nameless hero is to gather the seeds, which are scattered all over Sera's surface, to restore the Force of the planet, and to save it from demonic invasion.
The entire exploration in Emerald Densetsu is done from a side-scrolling perspective, but it is not an action game; it is a solo turn-based RPG. Enemies appear randomly, their pictures super-imposed on the exploration screen. The fighting is performed by selecting menu commands. The hero has force points and uses force techniques, which work like magic spells . Defeated enemies give the hero experience points, allowing him to level up and become stronger. There is no money in the game :items, weapons, and armor can only be found by exploring the world, or dropped by enemies.</desc>

		<name>Emerald Densetsu</name>
		<desc>Somewhere in the galaxy, there is a planet named Sera. It is protected by a wall of energy which its inhabitants call "Force". The Force is sustained by magical crystals known as seeds. When demons begin to invade the planet, the task of the nameless hero is to gather the seeds, which are scattered all over Sera's surface, to restore the Force of the planet, and to save it from demonic invasion.
The entire exploration in Emerald Densetsu is done from a side-scrolling perspective, but it is not an action game; it is a solo turn-based RPG. Enemies appear randomly, their pictures super-imposed on the exploration screen. The fighting is performed by selecting menu commands. The hero has force points and uses force techniques, which work like magic spells . Defeated enemies give the hero experience points, allowing him to level up and become stronger. There is no money in the game :items, weapons, and armor can only be found by exploring the world, or dropped by enemies.</desc>

The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...</desc>

		<desc>The plot of Exterlien is very simple: a beauty contest is held in an amusement park. Suddenly, monsters invade the park in an attempt to kidnap the girls. The protagonist, a young man named Masato, decides to venture into the dangerous zone and rescue the beauties.

Exterlien has turn-based battles against monsters, but it cannot be qualified as an RPG due to the extreme simplicity of the combat. The player should simply figure out which attack damages the monster most. There are no experience points, physical exploration, money, equipment, or any other essential RPG elements. The core gameplay is that of a Japanese menu-driven adventure: choose which location to go to, select the best attacks against a monster, be rewarded with erotic (very "softcore") images of the rescued girls.</desc>

		<desc>The plot of Exterlien is very simple: a beauty contest is held in an amusement park. Suddenly, monsters invade the park in an attempt to kidnap the girls. The protagonist, a young man named Masato, decides to venture into the dangerous zone and rescue the beauties.

Exterlien has turn-based battles against monsters, but it cannot be qualified as an RPG due to the extreme simplicity of the combat. The player should simply figure out which attack damages the monster most. There are no experience points, physical exploration, money, equipment, or any other essential RPG elements. The core gameplay is that of a Japanese menu-driven adventure: choose which location to go to, select the best attacks against a monster, be rewarded with erotic (very "softcore") images of the rescued girls.</desc>

		<name>Fantasian</name>
		<desc>The magical country of Luizard has been recently terrorized by the minions of the demon king Billades. The king of the country recruits a party of brave warriors, asking them to do the impossible: venture into the depths of Billades' lair, defeat the demon king, and release the Elven Seed that would restore the country to its glory.

Fantasian is a role-playing game that mostly relies on the Wizardry template. The player creates characters (up to five in the active party), choosing between traditional fantasy races (elf, half-orc, etc.) and classes. The latter are divided into four disciplines (thief, fighter, monk, and magician), each containing two classes, of which the less powerful one may evolve into a stronger form by meeting certain conditions during  gameplay.

The player then takes these characters to explore an abstract maze, fighting randomly appearing enemies. Combat takes place on a top-down screen and is similar in concept to that of Ultima games.</desc>

		<name>Final Crisis</name>
		<desc>In the year 2991 AD, the Galactic Federal Government agreed to a full-scale disarmament treaty with the Andromeda nation and it looked like the galaxy would finally be at peace. However, just before the signing of the treaty, members of the military-industrial complex, who were opposed to the treaty, carried out a coup d'etat to prevent this. Colonel Iritsa Renina, commander of the Beta Unit of the Galactic Federation, refused to help the coup and ordered the rebellion to be suppressed. The object of the game is that you, the Beta Unit ace pilot, Ensign Rova Trotskyna must destroy the federal facility that was occupied in the coup.
Final Crisis: Terrestrial Defense Police is a side-scrolling shoot'em up. You start with a standard firepower, but by shooting certain enemies it may leave items that can give you different weapons like the standard shot, homing shots or the laser. Throughout the game you have the option to choose which one you want to use as main weapon.</desc>

The object of the game is that you, the Beta Unit ace pilot, Ensign Rova Trotskyna must destroy the federal facility that was occupied in the coup.
Final Crisis: Terrestrial Defense Police is a side-scrolling shoot'em up. You start with a standard firepower, but by shooting certain enemies it may leave items that can give you different weapons like the standard shot, homing shots or the laser. Throughout the game you have the option to choose which one you want to use as main weapon.</desc>

		<desc>Final Lolita has little to do with PSK's previous similarly-named titles gameplay-wise; however, it shares with them the macabre premise of sex with underage girls, and is the most explicit and violent of the three. The game's genre is closest to RPG format, since it focuses on a character's attributes and allows the player to increase them. These attributes are Power, Arm Level, Defence, and Technique, each playing a role in upcoming battles. The player can choose to distribute a hundred points among these parameters in the beginning of the game. Navigation takes place on a top-down map, the player character represented as a simple square. Many spots on the map contain various objects, which will increase or decrease the protagonist's attributes. The goal is to power up the character sufficiently for combat. Battles occur when the player navigates the main character to a spot occupied by a girl and chooses to attack her.</desc>

		<desc>It is 100 years into the future. Nuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction are banned, but a new piece of military hardware is about to shape the future. The N.A.P. (New Age Power-Suit), is the newest weapon, a mechanical tank, able to destroy anything in its path. You play as a soldier of the El Shiria Military's "Undead" unit named Howie Bowie (no joke) as you are about to go on a urgent mission to destroy your enemies, The Bloody Axis, before they can strike at your nation.

Using the newest N.A.P., the K-19 Phantom, you are dispatched to destroy them before it is too late. You can equip your N.A.P. with up to 14 different weapons including flamethrowers and landmines and has seven stages, fighting your way on the streets, through deserts and up to the Axis HQ and finally a mech-to-mech battle with the enemy.</desc>

		<desc>It is 100 years into the future. Nuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction are banned, but a new piece of military hardware is about to shape the future. The N.A.P. (New Age Power-Suit), is the newest weapon, a mechanical tank, able to destroy anything in its path. You play as a soldier of the El Shiria Military's "Undead" unit named Howie Bowie (no joke) as you are about to go on a urgent mission to destroy your enemies, The Bloody Axis, before they can strike at your nation.

Using the newest N.A.P., the K-19 Phantom, you are dispatched to destroy them before it is too late. You can equip your N.A.P. with up to 14 different weapons including flamethrowers and landmines and has seven stages, fighting your way on the streets, through deserts and up to the Axis HQ and finally a mech-to-mech battle with the enemy.</desc>

Levels are divided into sub-levels, with each fourth one featuring a boss fight.

Red Stones are placed in key locations across the levels.  They can be pushed, stacked on top of each other, and even destroyed.  Flappy must strategically take advantage of the gravity and the Red Stones in order to clear the path for pushing the Blue Stone.  Three different types of enemies will try to prevent Flappy from clearing the level, so you must either avoid the enemies, crush them from above with the Stones, or pick up Sleeping Mushrooms to knock them out temporarily.</desc>

		<name>Flicky</name>
		<desc>The premise of Flicky is dramatically simple: the chick has to face a succession of fixed boards (which form an infinite loop around themselves) full of platforms. The other inhabitants of the board are a variable number of tiny chicks, a kitten called Tiger and an iguana called Iggy. The objective is of course to collect all the chicks and get them to the exit while avoiding Tiger and Iggy. Once taken under your wing, the chicks will follow you in single file. If Tiger or Iggy manage to hit one of the chicks, it will stop following you and you will have to retrieve it. If the two predators catch Flicky, they eat him, simple as that. The only way Flicky can get rid of his feline and reptilian pursuers is by picking up certain items lying around the levels and sending them into Tiger's vibrissae or Iggy's scales.</desc>

		<desc>The premise of Flicky is dramatically simple: the chick has to face a succession of fixed boards (which form an infinite loop around themselves) full of platforms. The other inhabitants of the board are a variable number of tiny chicks, a kitten called Tiger and an iguana called Iggy. The objective is of course to collect all the chicks and get them to the exit while avoiding Tiger and Iggy. Once taken under your wing, the chicks will follow you in single file. If Tiger or Iggy manage to hit one of the chicks, it will stop following you and you will have to retrieve it. If the two predators catch Flicky, they eat him, simple as that. The only way Flicky can get rid of his feline and reptilian pursuers is by picking up certain items lying around the levels and sending them into Tiger's vibrissae or Iggy's scales.</desc>

You must keep some on guard duties, balancing this against how many you send off to attack other territories, in which case you must wait and see the outcome. You get more men as the game goes on, ultimately increasing the status of your bases, and this isn?t dependent on how many are kept back, unlike Megalomania?s breeding effect.</desc>

		<name>Foxy</name>
		<desc>The story of Foxy is rather basic: a hostile army from a country known simply as "Red" attacks the capital city of the "Blue" nation. Not only the enemy tries to invade the most important strategic points of the city - enemy generals also try to capture and enslave the "Blue" girls! Naturally, they must be stopped! As the commander of the Blue army, it's the player's task to face enemy forces in battles, rescue the girls, and drive the Reds out of the city.

Foxy is a pure strategy game, without any RPG elements. The player is taken from one battle to another; there is no gameplay outside of battles. The battles take place in various city districts. The player navigates his/her units in turn-based fashion. In the beginning, the battles are relatively small-scale, with infantry and tank units; as the game progresses, more unit types are introduced, including massive rocket-launching tanks, jet planes, catapults, etc.

Each unit has distinct advantages and disadvantages, different mobility, attack range, etc. For example, infantry units that carry rocket launchers can only attack diagonally, but cannot be hurt when they attack tanks from that position; being attacked frontally, however, makes them very vulnerable. Terrain also plays a role; certain terrain types may slow down certain unit types, or be completely impassable to others. Each next battle features more complex layouts and larger amounts of units.

Between the battles there are cut-scenes, most of which are dedicated to rescuing the girls, and feature nudity and mild sexual situations.</desc>

Not only the enemy tries to invade the most important strategic points of the city - enemy generals also try to capture and enslave the "Blue" girls! Naturally, they must be stopped! As the commander of the Blue army, it's the player's task to face enemy forces in battles, rescue the girls, and drive the Reds out of the city.

Foxy is a pure strategy game, without any RPG elements. The player is taken from one battle to another; there is no gameplay outside of battles. The battles take place in various city districts. The player navigates his/her units in turn-based fashion. In the beginning, the battles are relatively small-scale, with infantry and tank units; as the game progresses, more unit types are introduced, including massive rocket-launching tanks, jet planes, catapults, etc.

Each unit has distinct advantages and disadvantages, different mobility, attack range, etc. For example, infantry units that carry rocket launchers can only attack diagonally, but cannot be hurt when they attack tanks from that position; being attacked frontally, however, makes them very vulnerable. Terrain also plays a role; certain terrain types may slow down certain unit types, or be completely impassable to others. Each next battle features more complex layouts and larger amounts of units.

Between the battles there are cut-scenes, most of which are dedicated to rescuing the girls, and feature nudity and mild sexual situations.</desc>

		<name>Fruit Panic</name>
		<desc>Fruit Panic is a platform game with some similarities to Mappy, albeit single-screen like Bomb Jack. Controlling Walky, a yellow ball with legs, you must pick up all fruit strewn across the platforms, while hunted by the Nyankys. Walky can't jump between platforms, so the only way to reach another platform, and more fruit, is to walk off the platform and go to one of the trampolines placed on the left and right of the screen. During his walk, Walky is a prone target for the Nyankys, who will hunt him from all directions. Walky's only defence is to drop on the head of a Nyanky, and his ability to lay bombs, of which he has a limited supply. Only one bomb may be laid at any time, preventing you from covering the screen in bombs. Jumping too many times on the trampoline will make it burst, costing Walky one life. When all fruit are picked, the game proceeds to the next level, with new platforms and another kind of fruit.

Fruit Panic has been remade in 1990 as the Game Boy game Tasmania Story.</desc>

		<desc>Gameplay involves moving from location to location, picking up any objects found there, and using them somewhere else to unlock puzzles. Commands took the form of verb and noun, e.g. "Take Wrench". Movement from location to location was limited to North, South, East, West, Up and Down.

The player of this game must navigate through a maze and a shooting gallery, charm a mermaid, and turn off a steam calliope that is so loud the player's instructions are misunderstood – a reference to the "Loud Room" in Zork I.In one room is a trampoline that the player can enter, deposit items in, and then exit. The player can then carry the trampoline around, regardless of how much it is holding, thus extending one's carrying capacity indefinitely. Violent solutions to puzzles are discouraged by a gameplay feature which sees the player character ejected from the fun house by a bouncer whenever certain commands are typed.</desc>

		<desc>Gai Flame is a fairly straightforward military strategy game starring giant robots and futuristic jets and tanks. This one is playable without knowledge of Japanese, given a little trial and error to figure out which menu items do what; there's no real story presented, other than the obvious something-is-at-stake-so-let's-fight-it-out-with-mechs scenario.
The game starts with a macro-level view of the world, with multiple six-square battlefields defined, each containing space for 3 player units and 3 enemy units. The player and CPU each deploy 9 units (from a larger inventory) at the start of the game.
Units can be moved from battlefield to battlefield -- when a battlefield contains player AND enemy units, the game shifts into a close-up of the local terrain, where individual units enter into combat.</desc>

		<desc>Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</desc>

		<name>Gandhara</name>
		<desc>Gandhara refers to the capital of the Kushan Empire, founded in 1st century BC, whose rulers were Buddhists; it was one of the most flourishing Buddhist states in history. The story of the game, however, is based on pure mythology, featuring Buddhist deities in their distinctly Japanese incarnations. The protagonist is contacted by the bodhisattva Akasagarbha, who tells him that the world is in danger: the king of demons is trying to locate and neutralize the holy Ashes of Buddha, whose power protects the eight worlds. The hero's task is to find the ashes and defeat whomever the king of demons might send to stop him.
The player navigates the hero through hostile top-down areas, fighting constantly respawning enemies with sword or magical spells. Rations must be bought in order to keep the hero alive. Defeated enemies grant the protagonist experience points; once a certain amount of those is accumulated, the hero levels up and grows stronger.</desc>

		<name>Gaudi - Barcelona No Kaze</name>
		<desc>Gaudi: Barcelona no Kaze was the first adventure developed by Wolf Team. It takes place in the Spanish city of Barcelona, which just the year before the release of the game was chosen for the celebration of the 25th Olympic Games. This is important to mention as the game takes place in the summer of 1992, the time at which the Olympic Games were being held in Barcelona. The game is a classic graphical adventure with static images and text, with the occasional appearance of small menus that ask you which action you want to execute next. Hard-boiled stories will be touching each corner of the most emblematic spaces of the city (which had been digitalized for the occasion, with special mention to the monuments designed by Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí). The stories have all the elements of a thriller, including terrorist attacks, characters with a dark past, romance, crime, etc. all this accompanied by elegant Latin jazz throughout the adventure.</desc>

		<name>Gaudi - Barcelona No Kaze</name>
		<desc>Gaudi: Barcelona no Kaze was the first adventure developed by Wolf Team. It takes place in the Spanish city of Barcelona, which just the year before the release of the game was chosen for the celebration of the 25th Olympic Games. This is important to mention as the game takes place in the summer of 1992, the time at which the Olympic Games were being held in Barcelona. The game is a classic graphical adventure with static images and text, with the occasional appearance of small menus that ask you which action you want to execute next. Hard-boiled stories will be touching each corner of the most emblematic spaces of the city (which had been digitalized for the occasion, with special mention to the monuments designed by Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí). The stories have all the elements of a thriller, including terrorist attacks, characters with a dark past, romance, crime, etc. all this accompanied by elegant Latin jazz throughout the adventure.</desc>

		<name>Gemstone Warrior</name>
		<desc>Gemstone Warrior is an action game with adventure elements. Players work their way through an underground catacomb, doing three things at once. First they need to find five pieces of a gemstone, spread throughout the maze. Second they need to avoid getting killed by the guardians of the catacomb. Finally they need to map the game, because the place is so large that it is easy to get lost. Once the Gemstone Warrior has collected the five gemstone pieces, he needs to move back to the point where he began the game.

The hero has to go underground because of demons. They stole the gemstone from humans, because they were jealous of the good magic it brought to humankind. They broke it up and spread it throughout their dungeon, to hide it.

This game is not just a "shoot-em-up"; it has many of the features of that style of game, but also gives players time to think. It includes a pause which helps one map and also to freeze a room, to see what is running toward the Gemstone Warrior.</desc>

		<desc>This is the first in Bothtec's series of games based on the anime adaptation of Yoshiki Tanaka's science fiction novel cycle Legend of the Galactic Heroes. The games are set in the fictional future as depicted in the novels: humanity has spread all over the Milky Way, and split into two powerful states which are having a permanent war with each other: the Galactic Empire, and the Free Planets Alliance. Two genius strategists are leading the forces of their respective states: Reinhard von Müsel for the Empire, and Yang Wenli for the Alliance.

The game is dedicated entirely to large-scale strategic battles and is not particularly story-driven. There are five different scenarios to choose from, which put the player in control of either Imperial or Alliance forces and revolve around "historical" battles based on the novels' lore, with exact dates and victory conditions.</desc>

There are five different scenarios to choose from, which put the player in control of either Imperial or Alliance forces and revolve around "historical" battles based on the novels' lore, with exact dates and victory conditions.</desc>

		<desc>This is the first in Bothtec's series of games based on the anime adaptation of Yoshiki Tanaka's science fiction novel cycle Legend of the Galactic Heroes. The games are set in the fictional future as depicted in the novels: humanity has spread all over the Milky Way, and split into two powerful states which are having a permanent war with each other: the Galactic Empire, and the Free Planets Alliance.

		<desc>The protagonist of the game is an eighteen-year-old boy whose destiny is to defeat a legendary demon, thus ending the Age of Darkness. As the hero embarks on his journey, he realizes that he must have chosen a wrong destination, for he becomes stranded on a tropical island that seems to be populated entirely by women. No, the hero does not abandon his world-saving mission because of that; but in order to leave the island, he needs to perform various quests for its young and pretty female inhabitants, which more often than not involve demonstrating... err... somewhat intimate aspects of his heroic nature. Girls Paradise is an adventure game without real puzzles and with menu-based interface; however, it differs from most typical Japanese adventures by allowing (and requiring) the player to find and pick up certain items and then use them from the inventory to advance in the game.</desc>

		<name>Godzilla</name>
		<desc>This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic industry takes form of a fighting game, only instead of the usual brave martial artists the players control horrifying monsters from the traditional  Toho lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.

The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.

The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal "punch-kick" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood.</desc>

		<name>Godzilla</name>
		<desc>This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic industry takes form of a fighting game, only instead of the usual brave martial artists the players control horrifying monsters from the traditional  Toho lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.

The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.

The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal "punch-kick" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood.</desc>

		<name>Goonies, The</name>
		<desc>The Goonies is based on a movie of the same name from 1985. A group of youngsters from a neighborhood called the "Goon Docks" are trying to find the lost treasure of One-Eyed Willie to prevent the foreclosure of their houses. Unfortunately, the treasure is buried under the hide-out of the infamous Fratelli gang, a family of ruthless criminals who are on the run from the law. You play as the asthmatic Mikey, who must find the treasure and save the other Goonies before time runs out.

The game consists of six levels. In each level, you must collect three keys to advance to the next area. These can be found by blowing open doors with bombs that are dropped by enemies. Also hidden behind doors are power-ups and other Goonies to rescue. Trying to stop you are enemies such as rats, skeletons, and even members of the Fratelli Gang.

Unlike the sequel, the Famicom version was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<name>Grobda</name>
		<desc>Grobda is a spin-off from Xevious, as the titular tank was originally an enemy in that game. The player takes control of the eponymous Grobda tank in an arena filled with numerous indestructible obstacles and several enemy tanks. When an enemy tank is killed, it will cause an explosion which can destroy other tanks as well as the player if positioned in the blast radius at the time. There is a shield that offers temporary protection from enemy fire, but constant firing from enemies will make it disappear. The game consists of 99 rounds, called "battlings".</desc>

		<desc>You play as a worker at a gumball factory, where you must move through the ranks of the factory by successfully sorting colored gumballs using a Rube Goldberg-esque gumball sorting machine.

The player starts each day at 0830 with a set quota of gumballs they must successfully sort through the day. Gumballs of different color are expelled from the machine in the top left corner, and they work their way through a series of complex devices to eventually be deposited from various slots at the bottom of the machine. The player controls the motion of various levers within the machine to control the pathway of the different colored gumballs. The player must then also move the colored carts at the bottom of the screen so that the correct colored gumball is deposited in each cart.</desc>

		<desc>Ikenai Holiday is a follow-up to Hacchake Ayayo-san. It is a short visual novel focusing on the erotic adventures of two young Japanese girls, Ayayo and Tomoko. The game begins with the girls deciding how to spend the holiday. From that point on, depending on the player's choices, the story splits into three vignettes: going to see an erotic movie, buying shoes, or reading erotic books. Each story invariably concludes with a sex scene.</desc>

		<desc>Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</desc>

		<desc>Hang-On is an arcade racing game, also bundled with the Master System and reminiscent of Pole Position, but with bikes. The player races against time, battling an unlimited amount of opponents on a highway. While the clock ticks down, he should try to maneuver past his opponents and to steer clear of obstacles on the side of the road. Beating the clock extends the time and draws a new backdrop to race in.</desc>

		<name>Hercules</name>
		<desc>The 16-bit box calls this ?The Ultimate Challenge? and they?re not kidding; this flick-screen platform game is one of the toughest you?ll come across. In the 8-bit versions Hercules has some titanic tasks to complete, whilst in the 16-bit versions his daughter Yolanda has been cursed and can only free herself by completing the same tasks.

Unusually, the game?s dozens of screens are given in a random order, with a different one after you lose each life. You have no weapon with which to harm the various creatures that lurk within. The pace of the enemies is quite hectic, but the real unique feature is that you must keep moving ? each platform is set on fire a few seconds after you first touch it.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the later parts of the Dragonlance book Dragons of Autumn Twilight, the heroes descend into a ruined city in search of the disks of Mishakal.

The gameplay consists of horizontal fighting with a maze like map using doors to change the view.  The party consists of the 8 Heroes of the Lance, using one at a time and the player can switch between them at any time.  Each character has different types of attacks and spells making them more suited to fighting different enemies as well as acting as lives.

One of the AD&amp;D games that takes a break from the usual RPG style.</desc>

		<desc>The first, obscure instalment in the Herzog series is also one of the early precursors of the modern-day RTS (real-time strategy game) genre that was popularised by Dune 2. Unlike the common RTS game, the playfield is a long vertical stretch instead of the well-known map stretching in both X and Y axes.

Another now unique trait is that there is little emphasis on building up a base to produce units which are then directly commanded into action. Instead, a base is already located at each end of the path, and the player is given control over a hovering battlemech. New units are bought using funds accumulated during play. These units, ranging from single foot soldiers to tanks and AA batteries, advance from the home base towards the enemy base. The player may pick up a single unit (or five soldiers) and move them closer to the enemy base in order to speed up the attack. A radar on the top of the screen gives an overlook of the battlefield.</desc>

		<desc>Hokuto no Ken is based on the manga series Fist of the North Star. The story focuses on Kenshiro, a young martial artist proficient in the deadly technique known as Hokuto Shinken, which he uses to protect innocents against malevolent fighters populating a post-apocalyptic world. The game's plot follows the initial story arc of the manga, as Kenshiro and Bat are trying to locate Kenshiro's old rival Shin. This incarnation of the series is a Japanese-style adventure, with still screens representing locations and menu-based interaction with the environment. The verb menu is the same for all screens, comprising eleven commands. The player advances the story by exploring locations and trying out all the commands, combining some of them with objects. The game also includes a few fight sequences, during which the player has to aim a specific body part and charge a punch to inflict damage to the enemy.</desc>

		<desc>Daisuke's girlfriend Kasumi has asked him to write music for lyrics she's written, and being the upstanding young man he is, he accepts. Toiling for three days on the song, he finally finishes and can't wait to play it for Kasumi! He heads off to Kasumi's house and rings the bell, but her father answers and tells Daisuke that she hasn't returned from school yet. Moments later again, the phone rings. Kasumi has been kidnapped! Her father gives Daisuke a small UFO for some reason, and he rushes off to save her!

Hole Chaser is a simple action game where the player must guide a rather unruly-to-operate UFO to the end of a maze. It will bounce off any hazards in the stage, and can't be crushed, but there is a strict time limit for each stage. Fail to complete the stage in time, and it's game over. Reach the goal, and the player is shown a short scene of Kasumi being sexually assaulted by her captor. The scenes get continually more explicit as the game progresses. There are six stages total, as well as a music mode for listening to the BGM.</desc>

		<name>Hoshi No Suna Monogatari</name>
		<desc>Gengorou Imai is a 19-year old lad who wants to have a simple life, his only passion being young pretty women. He stays in a boarding house in the country, enjoying the quiet life, the sea, the beach, and the abundance of those he likes most... So all goes well, until one of the guests who was staying at the boarding house is killed. Not entirely trusting the police, the owner of the boarding house asks Gen to look into this. Gen knows that the deceased was having a relationship with the owner's daughter. The young man begins his investigation, saying good-bye to quiet life - but not to the seductive young female tenants of the boarding house...

Hoshi no Suna Monogatari is the first in the  series of adult detective/mystery adventures by  D.O.. The game world is composed of still screens viewed from first-person perspective; navigation is done by selecting locations from a menu. At every screen, a full list of commands is available, from the standard "Look" and "Talk" to the more specific "Kiss", as well as "Ask", "Use Item", and "Show Item". Advancing in the game usually means investigating the locations, talking to everyone, asking the right person about the right topic, and showing the right person the right item.</desc>

		<desc>Gengorou Imai is a 19-year old lad who wants to have a simple life, his only passion being young pretty women. He stays in a boarding house in the country, enjoying the quiet life, the sea, the beach, and the abundance of those he likes most... So all goes well, until one of the guests who was staying at the boarding house is killed. Not entirely trusting the police, the owner of the boarding house asks Gen to look into this. Gen knows that the deceased was having a relationship with the owner's daughter. The young man begins his investigation, saying good-bye to quiet life - but not to the seductive young female tenants of the boarding house...

Hoshi no Suna Monogatari is the first in the  series of adult detective/mystery adventures by  D.O.. The game world is composed of still screens viewed from first-person perspective; navigation is done by selecting locations from a menu. At every screen, a full list of commands is available, from the standard "Look" and "Talk" to the more specific "Kiss", as well as "Ask", "Use Item", and "Show Item". Advancing in the game usually means investigating the locations, talking to everyone, asking the right person about the right topic, and showing the right person the right item.</desc>

		<name>Hotel Wars</name>
		<desc>Hotel Wars is a business simulation game where players build a chain of hotels in Europe. Up to 4 players can compete against the CPU. The game has a fixed period of time and doesn't tell players what their CPU competitor is doing.

There are 18 European cities available and players are given 9 options to choose during their turns. They can build hotels, hire chefs and managers, train them, get loans from banks, buy or sell stocks to increase their revenue. Players can use a telephone to call financial advisors that will give them information about their competitors, an insurance company to avoid losing too much money in case of a fire, a Yakuza member who will help players hijack their competitor's hotel (At the cost of extorting money from the player each month) and the police which will fine players for using the services of the Yakuza but will protect them from future payments to the mafia. Players can also take over the hotels of their competitors. Players that have gone bankrupt will have their hotels bought out by their competition.

The game progresses on a monthly basis and each time players choose what to do, the game displays their monthly earnings and losses. Economic factors also play a key role in the game as the game pinpoints the state of economy during gameplay. In order to win this game, players must be the first to build a chain of 10 hotels and make a revenue of $5000000. In case no player has achieved this goal, the game continues until the deadline assigned by the player in the beginning of the game.

There are a few events to look out for in the game:
In April, a tax inspection will take place. Depending on the skills of the manager, players may have to pay a fine of up to $100000. If players haven't hired a manager before the tax inspection, they will be fined $20000. In case players can't pay the fine, they will have their hotel seized.
Depending on the skills of the chefs, the hotel visitors may get food poisoning, especially during Summer. If that happens, the hotel where the food poisoning occured will be suspended for one month.
There is high probability of catching fire in Winter. When this happens, players will permanently lose their hotel. This probability is connected to the manager's skills, as well as the state of the economy.</desc>

		<name>Hover Attack</name>
		<desc>Hover Attack is a multi-directional shooter in which the player has to transfer a mobile base through a hostile level towards the exit. The base itself can fire an unlimited amount of short-ranged missiles, but has limited manoeuvrability. In order to be able to withstand the constant enemy onslaught, the player must release the pilot from time to time, and have him explore the location on his own, leaving the base behind. 

The pilot is equipped with a jetpack and can therefore jump much higher than the base, and generally move faster and more efficiently. He can fire independently of his movement, and his missiles are long-ranged. Three different shot angles are bound to three keys on the keyboard: up, straight, and down. The pilot, however, can fire only a limited amount of missiles, and will also run out of fuel for his jetpack. He will have to return to the base to recharge his ammo and to refuel.</desc>

		<desc>An evil demon named Varalys casts a curse upon the princess Ann, turning her into three fairies. You control Sir Jim and set out to find the fairies, and then slay Varalys.  Only by vanquishing Varalys can the curse be lifted. Once the princess is restored the kingdom will be saved.

Hydlide is an action game with strong role-playing elements. The player has to explore vast wilderness areas, descending into dungeons and eliminating enemies on the way. Combat system is similar to the one implemented in Ys series: attacking enemies requires the player to "bump" into them, at the same time preventing them from attacking the playable character from the sides and the back. The player can change between defensive and offensive stances by pressing a single button. Magic spells can also be used to dispose of the enemies. The player character grows stronger and gains better parameters as he advances in the game.</desc>

		<name>Hydlide 2 - Shine Of Darkness</name>
		<desc>Hydlide II: Shine Of Darkness is an action RPG, and the second installment in the Hydlide series. In a different space a wonderful world existed, called Fairy Land, which was dominated by swords and magic after the times of domination by monsters and evil had ended. The people of Fairy Land were intoxicated with peace. At that time an incident occurred. A Consciousness filled with evil awoke and it created new monsters, brought the dead back to life, and wanted to dominate Fairy Land again. The monks were one of the first who noticed this and warned the people about it but they didn't listen and left the monks disappointed. The monks prayed to God and asked Him if there was a Savior.</desc>

		<desc>In Ice Climber one or two players need to climb their way to the top of 32 different mountains. Each mountain is broken up into eight levels of platforms along with a bonus stage at the top. Attempting to stop the player from making upward progress are different creatures ranging from polar bears to condors, as well as treacherous landscapes with falling icicles, moving platforms, and icy floors. To help out, the players have a weapon, a mallet, which can be used to knock out enemies as well as bust away bricks in the platforms to provide some room to jump up to the next level. When the player finally reaches the top, it's time to move on to the next, more difficult level.</desc>

		<desc>This strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other historical simulation games by the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.</desc>

		<desc>It is the year 2061, and Halley's Comet is coming towards Earth. A crew has been gathered from eight different countries to man a pair of space probes sent to investigate the comet. The two probes, Comet and Corona, are to launch from Space Lab Jesus and collect a sample of the gases in the tail of the comet, and determine if life on Earth was brought by this comet as some have speculated. However, communication has been lost with the probe Comet; what could be going on?

Jesus is a Japanese-style adventure game. Each area is shown with an image, and you have the option of several commands. The player takes the role of Japanese pilot Hayao Musou, a member of the crew, and attempts to solve the mystery surrounding Comet and Halley's Comet.</desc>

		<desc>It is the year 2061, and Halley's Comet is coming towards Earth. A crew has been gathered from eight different countries to man a pair of space probes sent to investigate the comet. The two probes, Comet and Corona, are to launch from Space Lab Jesus and collect a sample of the gases in the tail of the comet, and determine if life on Earth was brought by this comet as some have speculated. However, communication has been lost with the probe Comet; what could be going on?

Jesus is a Japanese-style adventure game. Each area is shown with an image, and you have the option of several commands. The player takes the role of Japanese pilot Hayao Musou, a member of the crew, and attempts to solve the mystery surrounding Comet and Halley's Comet.</desc>

		<desc>On board the ship Callisto, sailing through the Mediterranean Sea, are two friends from Japan - Kazuya Goshiki and Shinji Saeki, on their way to Monaco, where they want to compete in a motor race using their three-wheel drive. Suddenly, the ship stops moving. Kazuya talks to the captain and finds out that a large container has just dropped from the sky into the sea. Most of the passengers assume it was junk thrown out of a space ship; but shortly afterwards, several crew members are murdered under mysterious circumstances. Kazuya begins to see a connection to a Halley's Comet incident that happened four years ago, and realizes things are much worse than anyone else would assume...

Jesus II is a Japanese-style adventure with a large amount of dialogue and very simple interaction: the player is only able to choose basic commands such as "Examine", "Talk", "Move", etc., without the possibility of selecting objects to interact with.</desc>

		<desc>On board the ship Callisto, sailing through the Mediterranean Sea, are two friends from Japan - Kazuya Goshiki and Shinji Saeki, on their way to Monaco, where they want to compete in a motor race using their three-wheel drive. Suddenly, the ship stops moving. Kazuya talks to the captain and finds out that a large container has just dropped from the sky into the sea. Most of the passengers assume it was junk thrown out of a space ship; but shortly afterwards, several crew members are murdered under mysterious circumstances. Kazuya begins to see a connection to a Halley's Comet incident that happened four years ago, and realizes things are much worse than anyone else would assume...

Jesus II is a Japanese-style adventure with a large amount of dialogue and very simple interaction: the player is only able to choose basic commands such as "Examine", "Talk", "Move", etc., without the possibility of selecting objects to interact with.</desc>

		<name>Jigoku No Renshuu Mondai</name>
		<desc>Jigoku no Renshū Mondai  is a text adventure with graphics. The game casts the player in the role of a novice angel who has to travel to hell in order to get acquainted with its inhabitants and withstand its trials. The player navigates the angel by typing N, W, E, and S representing the four directions, and inputting commands consisting of verbs and nouns to interact with characters and environment.

Hell is populated by various famous characters with very different degrees of ethical credibility justifying their presence in such a place, ranging from Adolf Hitler to John Lennon. Most characters will ask the angel simple historical questions; answering these correctly will usually yield an item that can be used in other locations to retrieve further items, bypass various dangers, etc. The player character may get killed if the player chooses a wrong response or travels to a hazardous area without a corresponding item.</desc>

		<desc>Joshidaisei Private is an erotic sliding tile puzzle game. The player is presented with a 3x3 grid obfuscating an erotic picture of a young female college student. By moving the disarranged tiles one at a time the player eventually completes the image and unveils the larger picture. In the beginning of the game the player selects between the three available young women: Miyuki, Yuko, or Kiyoko. Each one of them offers three stages of tile-sliding, with ten combinations each. The player can also select between "quadratic" and "cubic" tile types.</desc>

		<desc>A girl named Kumiko is spending a vacation with her younger sister Nagisa in Karuizawa, a popular tourist destination in Japan. The vacation turns into nightmare when Nagisa doesn't return home from the local supermarket. Kumiko receives a strange phone call later that evening, and decides to call the police. However, the authorities seem unable to solve the mystery, and Kumiko's boyfriend decides to conduct the investigation by himself. Karuizawa Yūkai Annai is an adventure game that relies on exploration and information-gathering rather than on puzzle-solving. Individual locations are displayed as still screens viewed from first-person perspective; however, the player can also navigate the protagonist on a top-down map. The player is presented with a large menu of commands, which are for the most part identical on every screen. Some of these commands can be combined with objects chosen from a menu.</desc>

		<desc>Ken to Mahō is a fantasy role-playing game. An evil wizard has killed the benevolent king of Border Land and captured the princess. It is up to a lone adventurer to rescue the princess and restore peace in the land. The player can choose between nine character types that include both classes (Fighter, White Knight, Black Knight, Druid, Pilgrim, and Wizard) and races (Human, Dwarf, and Elf), each with different attributes that influence their performance in combat. The game world is open and consists of top-down areas with simple graphics and icons representing towns and castles where the protagonist can rest. Turn-based one-on-one battles allow the player to choose between various types of attacks and a single "magic" command.</desc>

Whenever they fail to hide their unique nature, the whole family has to move. But now Kyosuke has met a beautiful girl, who is being courted by another guy - a big temptation for him to use the powers...
Kimagure Orange Road: Natsu no Mirage is a Japanese-style adventure game. The interaction is performed by selecting verb/object combinations from an omnipresent menu.

These are sometimes required to execute in order to trigger the next event of the story.</desc>

		<desc>The game is based on the manga and anime series Kimagure Orange Road. The protagonist is a young boy named Kyosuke Kasuga. He and his siblings (twin sisters) possess supernatural abilities: telekinesis, teleportation, time shift, etc. The tradition of their family forbids them to use these powers publicly. Whenever they fail to hide their unique nature, the whole family has to move. But now Kyosuke has met a beautiful girl, who is being courted by another guy - a big temptation for him to use the powers...

		<name>Kiss Of Murder</name>
		<desc>Kiss of Murder is an adventure game set in a parallel world to Manhattan Requiem. While it features the same graphics and set of characters as that title, it has a completely different story. In Manhattan a large blue sapphire has been stolen and a young woman named Sarah Shields who worked at a jewelry store has been murdered. Insurance investigator Judd Gregory has contacted the private detective  J.B. Harold and asked him for help with the case. Gameplay involves going to various locations in New York, talking to people, interrogating suspects, finding clues and gathering evidence.

Early releases of the game (PC-88, X68000, FM-7, X1 and PC-98) are add-ons and require Manhattan Requiem to play. Later iterations became stand-alone.</desc>

		<name>Lamia 1999</name>
		<desc>UFO sightings and alleged contacts with aliens that were widespread in the second half of the 20th century eventually became a horrible reality. In the year 1999, aliens attacked Earth, and within a short time destroyed many of its cities and conquered the planet. A young man named Joe is wandering the ruins of Tokyo, trying to find his missing girlfriend Lamia. In the process he will find out about a human resistance movement and try to liberate Earth.

Lamia-1999 is a role-playing game in which the player controls Joe, navigating him through complex, seamless side-scrolling locations of Tokyo. In the beginning of the game the player can distribute a few remaining points to raise Joe's attributes. Hostile aliens are roaming the city streets; a contact with them initiates a battle sequence, which takes place on a separate, confined screen. Combat is action-oriented and allows Joe to jump, dodging the aliens' ranged attacks.</desc>

		<desc>The town Newcam, Massachusetts, 1924. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...

Laplace no Ma is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc.</desc>

If you step on a blinking question mark tile you'll get either a points bonus, movement speed or jumping ability increase, 1up or turn into Super Vickey.

		<name>Last Armageddon</name>
		<desc>The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.
Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens.</desc>

The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.
Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens.</desc>

		<name>Legend</name>
		<desc>Legend is the sequel to it's namesake for the SNES. Despite the conversion to 3D, the game still keeps all the action in a two dimensional plane.

The Kingdom of Tovakia is overtaken by chaos and despair. After several assassination attempts, the king's brother is sent into exile. During his exile, however, he learns the dark arts of sorcery. He summons a demon to support him in his quest to rule over Tovakia. When he manages to kidnap the king, it is up to the protagonists to save him, and Tovakia, from the evil brother.

You can choose to play one of three characters: Axel (all-round character), Tara (fast and good with light weapons) and Karo (slow but strong and good with heavy weapons).

You will find a wide array of weapons and enemies in this 3D Beat 'em Up. Besides the standard medieval weaponry there are various ranged spells you can use to hurt the enemy. There are five stages to play through and each stage ends with a level boss.

In multiplayer it is possible to play the game in two player co-op with increased difficulty.</desc>

		<name>Light Flipper</name>
		<desc>Light Flipper is a puzzle platformer where the player takes control of the titular character, a green little creature. The game consists of single screen levels and the objective in each is to collect all keys so that an exit opens up. Each level has a river at the bottom where the player enters on a raft from the right with the exit being on the left side.

The player character can climb walls and will automatically do so when using the jump button to move vertically. Creatures roam the levels and these have to be avoided or else the player will lose a life. It is also necessary to avoid falling rocks and jumping into the water. Oxygen is limited and will run out unless the player picks up oxygen tanks that replenishes it. To kill the enemies flash lights has to be collected. After being activated they work similarly to power pills in Pac-Man and allows the player to go after the enemies for a brief moment. Additionally there are pots that can be collected for bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>Lion is a sequel to Wolf: you are now placed in the same simulation environment, but this time you simulate a....you guessed it, a lion.

As in the original you take the role of a lion chosen from a pool of 20 different animals, with varying attributes, in existing prides or handpicked groups made by yourself. You can control a single animal or all members of a pride and you get to play in either a 20-mission mode (such as survive for a day) or a simulation mode, which allows you to do whatever you want.

Unlike Wolf, which takes place in three different locales, Lion is played only on the savannas and plains of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania (tough in four different seasons).

Also includes a "Lion Safari", an interactive tour of the leonine life on the Serengeti.</desc>

		<desc>This is the mother of The Sims. When you load the game for the first time and personalise it with your name you'll see a house with several rooms like a kitchen, living room, bed room, etc. After some time of waiting a little person will appear and check out the house with all its rooms to see if he likes it. If he likes it, he will move in shortly and bring his dog along with him. That's where the real "game" starts and thats what it will be like every time you'll load the game from then. You see the house and the little person living in it, doing all kinds of stuff people do in their daily routine. He'll cook, eat, feed his dog, read newspapers, watch TV and from time to time he will write you a letter to let you know what he feels or what things he misses. To keep it more gamelike, you can "talk" to him in form of typing commands like "feed dog". You can also play cards with him and send him food or a present.
There is no aim in this game other than to interact with your LCP.</desc>

The goal is to explore a maze-like pseudo-3D tower and locate a magical book that would help the hero to rescue a captured princess. The player can choose between the classes of Fighter, Thief, and Merchant when creating the protagonist. Town menu is wholly text-based. Battles are random and allow the player to either attack or use items.</desc>

		<name>Lolita - Yakyuuken</name>
		<desc>Lolita: Yakyūken is a simple video game adaptation of yakyūken, a Japanese parlor game that is essentially strip rock-paper-scissors. The gameplay involves pressing one of the three numbered keys (1, 2 or 3) corresponding to the rock, paper and scissors moves of the game, trying to beat the opponent's choice. All this is done while seeing a drawing of a young girl. The girl removes an item of her clothing after each successful round, and the player wins the game when she is completely naked. The player character has five symbolic clothes items, i.e. losing five rounds leads to a Game Over.</desc>

		<name>Lolita 2 - Gekou Chase</name>
		<desc>Lolita 2: Gekō Chase has little to do with its predecessor gameplay-wise. It is a very simple text-only adventure in which the protagonist must track young girls after school and have them perform various actions (a few of them of a remotely sexual nature). The sparse descriptions are in Japanese, but the text parser is English-only, recognizing the four directions (N, S, W and E) and a few basic commands such as "Look" and "Use". Much of the game is spent navigating the protagonist through the invisible, text-only maze by typing the directional commands. A few items must be found and used in order to complete the game.</desc>

		<desc>Lolita Syndrome consists of four "rooms" (scenes), each shaped like a mini-game and each presenting a different young girl in a dangerous situation. These mini-games require little skill and are mostly based on guessing. For example, in one scene the player has to select numbered knives which are then thrown at the girl, hoping not to choose the two knives that will actually hurt her and end the game. Other mini-games involve selecting random keys to stop a torture device from killing the girl, inputting a few text commands to cure a sick girl, and participate in a rock-paper-scissors game. The fifth room contains no game and only consists of pictures. A successful completion of each stage leads images of naked girls.</desc>

		<desc>In Lot Lot, you directly control one arrow and indirectly control another which follows after your original arrow with a (roughly) 4-second delay. When you press the button, any balls on the compartment that one arrow points to are immediately swapped with the contents of the compartment that the other arrow points to. The goal of Lot Lot is to get as many tiny balls (which resemble Pachinko balls) out of grid compartments and down into point slots in order to achieve a designated score, and advance to the next round.</desc>

		<name>Lyrane</name>
		<desc>In the future, humans began to build space stations, on which special army units were always present to ensure that nothing threatens humanity from the depth of the cosmos. One of such space stations was called Lyrane. However, the master computer that was monitoring life support on Lyrane has gone insane. Machines have taken over the station, and its human residents were annihilated. The Earth sends a lone fighter craft to Lyrane on what looks like a suicide mission...

Lyrane is an action game that differs in several aspects from traditional arcade shooters. The view is top-down, but not vertically-scrolling; player-controlled aircraft can move in any direction (including diagonally), stopping at will. The controls are character-based rather than camera-oriented, i.e. pressing the "forward" button will always make the aircraft move forward, regardless of its position on the screen.</desc>

		<name>Mabel's Mansion</name>
		<desc>Barney the Bellhop just heard the unfortunate news that his aunt Mabel has passed. To balance this, it seems Mabel has left her considerable fortune to Barney as an inheritance. Mabel has hidden her treasures throughout her 90 room mansion, and has created a series of traps and puzzles that Barney must solve to prove himself worthy of her fortune. His aunt furthermore has summoned various monsters from the netherworld in order to guard the mansion and thwart Barney's progression. Mabel's ghost continues to haunt the largest cache, and she must be evaded for Barney to claim his reward.

The player must thoroughly explore the mansion, as keys have been cleverly hidden throughout the house. Various pieces of furniture must be pushed or manipulated, which will trigger events in other rooms. Weapons can be found hanging on the walls, and these can be used to vanquish the denizens of Mabel's domain. Each weapon is only effective against one monster.</desc>

		<desc>Macross: Countdown (released outside of Japan as just Macross) is a side-scrolling shoot'em up based on the classic anime series. Players control a Valkyrie fighter that launches from the Macross to rescue Lynn Minmay from the Zentradi. Many waves of enemies must be overcome by evading or shooting at them. A radar at the bottom of the screen displays incoming enemies and obstacles. As in the series, the Valkyrie can transform into one of three different modes, but cannot fire any weapons while transforming: in Fighter mode, it is fast and maneuverable. Speed and maneuverability are lower in Gerwalk mode, which can be useful for getting through tight spots. In Battroid mode, the Valkyrie's projectiles are self-seeking. Only in Fighter and Gerwalk modes, the Valkyrie can launch a powerful missile spread that can take out a lot of enemies at once. The spread is limited to three firings per wave, though.</desc>

Only in Fighter and Gerwalk modes, the Valkyrie can launch a powerful missile spread that can take out a lot of enemies at once. The spread is limited to three firings per wave, though.</desc>

		<desc>Maison Ikkoku is a Japanese menu-based graphical adventure game based on the anime and manga series. Players control Yusaku Godai and will need to help him find a secret photograph that's been hidden away by the manager. Godai will need to bribe the inhabitants, which constantly move around the house in order to get access to Kyoko's room. But even if Godai makes it into the manager's room and tries to look at the framed photo, something will always happen which will force Godai to leave the room. Thus, after multiple attempts, Godai makes the (il)logical decision to gather photos of all the inhabitants of the boarding house to make Kyoko show him the photo. The game has the player move between locations in the boarding house and the town, constantly running out of money, and meeting all the cast from the original comic book, including Nikaido who did not appear in the anime.</desc>

		<name>Manhattan Requiem</name>
		<desc>A 24-year-old woman was found dead in her flat in Manhattan, New York. Her skull was crushed - it was clear that she was murdered. Further investigation showed that she was working as a pianist. The police can find no clues, so it's time for the private detective  J.B. Harold to investigate the murder and to bring the killer to justice.

Despite its Japanese origins, Manhattan Requiem has realistic graphic design without any manga/anime influences. As an adventure game, it has Japanese influences (no inventory, no puzzles), as well as Western ones (relative freedom in navigation, detailed dialogue system, no "trigger commands" to advance the plot). The game plays similarly to a real investigation: the player has to question suspects, collect evidence, find new leads, after which new locations become accessible. It is also possible to review all the data collected during the investigation in-game, by going to a bar at any time.</desc>

		<name>Manhattan Requiem</name>
		<desc>A 24-year-old woman was found dead in her flat in Manhattan, New York. Her skull was crushed - it was clear that she was murdered. Further investigation showed that she was working as a pianist. The police can find no clues, so it's time for the private detective  J.B. Harold to investigate the murder and to bring the killer to justice.

Despite its Japanese origins, Manhattan Requiem has realistic graphic design without any manga/anime influences. As an adventure game, it has Japanese influences (no inventory, no puzzles), as well as Western ones (relative freedom in navigation, detailed dialogue system, no "trigger commands" to advance the plot). The game plays similarly to a real investigation: the player has to question suspects, collect evidence, find new leads, after which new locations become accessible. It is also possible to review all the data collected during the investigation in-game, by going to a bar at any time.</desc>

		<name>Mario Brothers Special</name>
		<desc>Mario Bros. Special is based on, but very different from, the original arcade game. Much like the original title, the action takes place on single screens, but the objective on each stage is no longer simply to kill all the enemies. There are four different screens, which cycle in order with increasing difficulty.

Unlike the original game, Mario cannot stun enemies from beneath. Certain platforms, however, are unstable, and if Mario jumps on them they will stun any enemies also on the same platform. He can also stomp enemies if his aim is correct. There is both a single-player and a two-player simultaneous mode.</desc>

		<name>Master Of Monsters</name>
		<desc>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another.</desc>

		<desc>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another.</desc>

		<desc>Cyberblock Metal Orange is a ball-and-paddle game with adult content. Like Breakout/Arkanoid, the player must keep the ball from falling out the bottom of the screen, while at the same time attempting to break all destructible blocks on the screen.

Whenever you break certain blocks, colored capsules will pop out. Pick up the blue capsule to slow down the speed of the ball. Picking up the red capsules will increase your power meter by one increment. Depending on how full it is, you can choose from 7 different power-ups.

Some of these can be powered up by two or more levels, while others cannot be used together.

Each stage stars one of 5 girls: Tomo, Kazumi, Mika, Rinn and Cynthia. They will take off pieces of clothing as you play through more levels. A stage is cleared when the girl is completely naked.</desc>

		<desc>Cyberblock Metal Orange is a ball-and-paddle game with adult content. Like Breakout/Arkanoid, the player must keep the ball from falling out the bottom of the screen, while at the same time attempting to break all destructible blocks on the screen.

Whenever you break certain blocks, colored capsules will pop out. Pick up the blue capsule to slow down the speed of the ball. Picking up the red capsules will increase your power meter by one increment. Depending on how full it is, you can choose from 7 different power-ups.

Some of these can be powered up by two or more levels, while others cannot be used together.

Each stage stars one of 5 girls: Tomo, Kazumi, Mika, Rinn and Cynthia. They will take off pieces of clothing as you play through more levels. A stage is cleared when the girl is completely naked.</desc>

		<desc>A party of adventurers in what appears to be a medieval fantasy world called Varn is looking for an entrance to the highly coveted Inner Sanctum. Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Their task is to find the real king and ultimately stop the mysterious space traveler, revealing the truth about the world's origin in the process.The Secret of the Inner Sanctum is a role-playing game and the first installment in the Might and Magic series. Core gameplay concept is similar to that of Wizardry games, though the game does not focus solely on dungeon crawling and features overworld areas and towns that can be physically navigated. In this way the game resembles The Bard's Tale, though it has a significantly larger playing environment with several towns.</desc>

Gates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and the sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. The gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor: the player creates a party of six characters and explores vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting turn-based enemies and gaining levels.

		<name>Missile Panic</name>
		<desc>Missile Panic is an action game where the player controls a missile and on each level must destroy several "cores" by flying into them. The missile constantly flies forward and can be turned in four directions, using on-screen controls, but cannot instantly turn 180 degrees. Colliding with a wall destroys the missile and means a game over; there is also a time limit to every level. The speed of the missile increases whenever it picks up an energy power-up or destroys a core.

Destroying a core causes the missile to lose one unit of energy, and if energy runs out while some cores remain intact, the level ends in failure. Energy can be replenished by collecting colorful balloons, and if energy is already full, the energy bar increases. Another bonus is the recovery flag, which restores the missile speed and energy to full and resets the time limit. 

The game was originally released as part of the compilation PicoPicoGames.</desc>

		<desc>Kazuya Mizukami is a young musician who returns to Japan after having spent four years studying abroad. However, things don't go very smoothly, and Kazuya even quarrels with a music producer who doesn't appreciate his talent. Everything becomes much worse when the producer is found dead shortly after their quarrel, and Kazuya becomes a murder suspect. He must clear his name, but for that he will need the help of his friends.

Misty Blue is a mystery-themed adventure game. There are no real puzzles in the game; however, the gameplay differs somewhat from most traditional Japanese adventures. The standard verb command menu is present only in a few locations. Most of the game is dedicated to conversations, during which the player must choose dialogue options. Characters Kazuya talks to have special meters that show how well they react to the player's choices. In addition, certain locations require the player to conduct some investigation, examining items and making conclusions.</desc>

		<desc>Kazuya Mizukami is a young musician who returns to Japan after having spent four years studying abroad. However, things don't go very smoothly, and Kazuya even quarrels with a music producer who doesn't appreciate his talent. Everything becomes much worse when the producer is found dead shortly after their quarrel, and Kazuya becomes a murder suspect. He must clear his name, but for that he will need the help of his friends.

Misty Blue is a mystery-themed adventure game. There are no real puzzles in the game; however, the gameplay differs somewhat from most traditional Japanese adventures. The standard verb command menu is present only in a few locations. Most of the game is dedicated to conversations, during which the player must choose dialogue options. Characters Kazuya talks to have special meters that show how well they react to the player's choices. In addition, certain locations require the player to conduct some investigation, examining items and making conclusions.</desc>

		<desc>Mole Mole is a puzzle game in which the player has to navigate a rather anthropomorphic mole through side-view single-screen stages, with the goal of reaching the exit after having collected all the fruits on the screen.

The mole can climb the stairs scattered around the levels, or dig tunnels in any direction except upwards. All the levels also include boulders, which will fall down if disturbed by the mole's burrowing activities. As opposed to  Boulder Dash variants, the boulders cannot kill the mole or harm him in any way; it is impossible to "die" in the game. However, unless the player calculates the moves with extreme precision, getting irrevocably stuck and restarting the level is a common occurrence.

The player can start from any of the 45 levels, arranged in order of ascending difficulty. There is also an editor that allows the players to create their own levels.</desc>

		<desc>The follow-up to Mole Mole plays exactly like the original, which means that it is very close to Boulder Dash but at a slower pace, since each move requires planning, whereas falling boulders won't kill you. Three difficulty levels are on offer: Selections, Children and Experts. Your mole, while digging tunnels in the earth to collect each and every item on-screen before proceeding to the exit, can neither jump nor dig upwards, which is what makes careful planning of your tunnels necessary. To your aid, you have a map screen which shows the entire level in a zoomed-out format. The same screen is also used for the built-in level editor.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Robot</name>
		<desc>A starship called 'The Eidolon' is transporting colonists to a new planet when the ship's computer starts to go a little crazy. The player takes on the role of Asimov, a lowly service mechanoid, who must save his robot friends and the sleeping human crew.

Mr. Robot is primarily a puzzle game. The first part of the game takes place on board the space ship, and contains environmental puzzle-solving similar to isometric games like Head over Heels and Cadaver, but with less emphasis on action, and recreated in 3D. The player often needs to hack into computer terminals or other robots. This part takes place inside a Matrix-style computer world, that involves the 'ghosts' of the robots fighting abstract enemy defence programs in turn-based combat reminiscent of Japanese-style RPGs.</desc>

		<desc>Cursed by the gods, on the verge of death, the protagonist of the game is transferred to a different realm - a fantasy land ruled by sword and sorcery, in which humans are threatened by rampaging goblins, orcs, and a mysterious dragon. The hero must find a powerful artifact known as the Heart of Phantasm in order to return home.

Mugen no Shinzō is a role-playing game similar to early Ultima games. The player controls a lone character with basic attributes who roams the vast land, visiting towns and dungeons. Overworld navigation is done by scrolling with arrow keys, without an icon to represent the player character. Town locations have little to no graphics; along with the dungeons, they are displayed in small windows. The maze-like dungeons are represented by abstract pseudo-3D vector graphics. Combat is random; the protagonist fights enemies one-on-one in simple turn-based fashion.</desc>

		<desc>After the protagonist of the previous game retrieved the precious Heart of Phantasm, he was teleported away from the magical world he had been stranded in - but not to his home, as he hoped, but to another fantasy realm, Elderein. This land suffers under the yoke of the evil Prince of Darkness, and it's up to the hero to deal with him and find a way to leave this world. Mugen no Shinzō II is a role-playing game very similar visually and gameplay-wise to early Ultima games. As opposed to the first game, overworld occupies the majority of the screen, and towns can be physically explored in a top-down fashion. Another change is elimination of random enemy encounters in favor of enemies visibly roaming the overworld. Characters can now join the protagonist and participate in battles. Battles are viewed from first-person perspective (with large enemy portraits) and feature simple turn-based mechanics.</desc>

		<desc>After having traveled to two magical realms, the hero was finally able to leave the world of Elderein and return to his own world, Luizard. However, upon his arrival he discovered that his travels have caused a time slip of several billion years. His world is now being threatened by the God of Darkness. He must use the Heart of Phantasm he found during his first adventure, and locate other heroes who would aid him on his quest and liberate the land.
Mugen no Shinzō III is in many ways quite different from its Ultima-inspired predecessor. Story progression is more linear, exploration more restricted; characters with their own backgrounds join the party, taking a cue from Japanese RPG design. However, the game doesn't have anime aesthetics characteristic of these games. Enemies are visibly roaming the overworld and dungeons; an encounter leads to a separate top-down battle screen, on which combat proceeds in real time.</desc>

		<desc>M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.

You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.

Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.

After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.

After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.

Third phase is the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for various tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. 

There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are: 

- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it. 

- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.

- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).

- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.

- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.

- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.

- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.

- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.

The game always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer.</desc>

		<desc>M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.

You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.

Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.

After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins.

		<desc>My Lolita is a medical simulation, albeit with the added twisted emphasis on undressing an underage girl. The game consists of several scenes during which the player controls a machine arm that can move in four directions as well as grab and release objects. This arm is used for undressing the girl and for all the other procedures such as measuring temperature, taking blood and urine samples, vaccinations, etc. The player has to manipulate the arm to the correct spots of the girl's body to execute these procedures. Some of them must be completed within a time limit. Afterwards it is necessary to make the correct diagnosis based on the results, and administer the correct medicine; failure to do so leads to Game Over.</desc>

		<desc>The first commercial Japanese erotic game, Night Life is a simple simulation of sexual intercourse, marketed as a tool aiming to help couples enjoy their sexual life more. Player interaction is restricted to a few choices. The player is given the option to make a schedule to determine the date of the woman's period. By answering a few questions, the player can choose a set of sexual positions he is willing to use for the virtual intercourse (these positions are also available as a "demo", accessed from the game's main menu). Afterwards, the player chooses the amount of time for each position. The subsequent display of the intercourse (dubbed Let's Fuck!!) is non-interactive and consists of a small picture of the chosen position in the middle of a screen, accompanied by a timer.</desc>

		<desc>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</desc>

		<desc>In Yuji Horii's follow-up to The Portopia Serial Murder Case, you once again play as a Tokyo police detective charged with solving a mysterious murder. This time, your initial investigation of a dead body found floating in Tokyo Bay quickly leads you to follow the trail of clues to Hokkaido. There, assisted by local police officer Shunsuke "Shun" Saruwatari, you will visit numerous popular real-life tourist attractions as you attempt to puzzle out the truth behind an ever-expanding series of murders.
While maintaining the same first-person adventure format, this game drops the parser-driven interface used in earlier versions of the preceding title, instead introducing the menu system which was to become typical of Japanese adventure games. The player selects from a number of simple commands to find new evidence and advance the plot; also, the "Examine" command can be used to point at and examine specific spots in the scene pictured.</desc>

		<name>Old Village Story, The</name>
		<desc>King Kaiser, the mighty ruler of the country Fa-Ral, had a daughter named Lisa, who became gravely ill. Anxious to know what will become of her and his kingdom, the king looks into a magic crystal. The crystal tells him that the one who can make things right is a boy named Shion, who lives in a quiet village far away from the capital city. The king tries to find Shion, but forces of darkness have plans of their own...

Despite its RPG-like premise and interface, The Old Village Story is a pure adventure game. The player navigates Shion (and another character during the second half of the game) through top-down environments, exploring towns and wilderness areas, entering buildings, and talking to people to gather information and advance the plot. There are no real puzzles in the game, and the challenge lies mostly in finding the right path in maze-like locations.</desc>

		<name>Old Village Story, The</name>
		<desc>King Kaiser, the mighty ruler of the country Fa-Ral, had a daughter named Lisa, who became gravely ill. Anxious to know what will become of her and his kingdom, the king looks into a magic crystal. The crystal tells him that the one who can make things right is a boy named Shion, who lives in a quiet village far away from the capital city. The king tries to find Shion, but forces of darkness have plans of their own...

Despite its RPG-like premise and interface, The Old Village Story is a pure adventure game. The player navigates Shion (and another character during the second half of the game) through top-down environments, exploring towns and wilderness areas, entering buildings, and talking to people to gather information and advance the plot. There are no real puzzles in the game, and the challenge lies mostly in finding the right path in maze-like locations.</desc>

		<desc>Hiroyuki Kitahara was leading a rather ordinary life in a quiet Japanese town, and decided one day to take a stroll at night, enjoying the picturesque landscape. All of a sudden, a horrifying monster appeared right in front of him. Kitahara wakes up in the hospital and tries to convince the doctors that he was not hallucinating. Teaming up with a young female journalist, Kitahara begins to explore the city, searching for clues to solve the mystery and seeking meeting with onryō (ghosts). 
Onryō Senki is a Japanese-style adventure game. There are no puzzles and no items to pick up or manipulate. Interaction with the environment is done by selecting commands from a menu. Four standard commands appear on most screens and sometimes lead to sub-menus with objects. For the most part the player is free to visit various locations in the town in any order. At the protagonist's home it is also possible to use the computer to review people's dossiers and information.</desc>

		<desc>Hiroyuki Kitahara was leading a rather ordinary life in a quiet Japanese town, and decided one day to take a stroll at night, enjoying the picturesque landscape. All of a sudden, a horrifying monster appeared right in front of him. Kitahara wakes up in the hospital and tries to convince the doctors that he was not hallucinating. Teaming up with a young female journalist, Kitahara begins to explore the city, searching for clues to solve the mystery and seeking meeting with onryō (ghosts). 
Onryō Senki is a Japanese-style adventure game. There are no puzzles and no items to pick up or manipulate. Interaction with the environment is done by selecting commands from a menu. Four standard commands appear on most screens and sometimes lead to sub-menus with objects. For the most part the player is free to visit various locations in the town in any order. At the protagonist's home it is also possible to use the computer to review people's dossiers and information.</desc>

		<name>Outlanders</name>
		<desc>Tetsuya Wakatsuki was just an average guy, lazy but well-meaning, and a photographer for the local newspaper. Your planet being attacked by an invading alien armada tends to change that sort of thing, though. The young princess of the invading army, Kahm, comes to Earth to take part in the annihilation of the human race. She ends up stranded on Earth, where Tetsuya finds her, and they fall for each other.

They decide that if they were to get married, the two planets would no longer be able to fight, and so they set off for Kahm's home planet to seek permission from her father, the emperor. Having been the one who ordered the invasion in the first place, though, he is not particularly pleased with this turn of events. Tetsuya is imprisoned, and Kahm is taken away to places unknown. Now, Tetsuya must break out of prison and rescue Kahm!

Outlanders is an action RPG based on the manga by Joji Manabe. Tetsuya, being just a regular guy, isn't a particularly able fighter, and at first is only equipped with a sword, though he can eventually find other weapons including a gun. At the beginning, Tetsuya's only companion is the brown, cloaked alien Nao, who helps him escape the holding cell, but eventually he will find others who will help him. Other standard RPG features are also present: items can be found and stored, and some characters can learn magic. The game uses a password system to save progress.</desc>

		<name>Pachicom</name>
		<desc>Pachicom is a pachinko game simulation. Pachinko can be described as a game that is a cross between pinball and a slot machine. This game comes with two different game modes to play. Game A lets the player play until they attain a score of at least 3000. The goal is to achieve this score as fast they possibly can. Though, the game can still end prematurely by running out of balls to shoot. Game B lets the player try to get as high of a score as possible, but with an added time limit.
The game contains over 200 different board layouts to choose from. At the main menu, just choosing Game A or B will randomly assign a board for the player to play on, while choosing Select A or B will let the player select their own board of choice to play on.
The gameplay is mainly passive. Players can only adjust the shooting pressure knob which effects the speed and location of where the balls will land.</desc>

		<desc>Peeping Scandal is a variation of the 15 puzzle with scantily clad women. Players choose one of the girls (Sayuri, Hiromi, Kumiko, Erika or Tomoko) and slide the tiles until they've completed an area of the screen. As soon as players have finished putting the tiles in order, the next area is open for them to solve. Solving all 10 areas will unlock a picture of the girl the players have chosen. The game has a password system with players inputting keywords to resume the game with the areas they've already cleared.</desc>

The adventuring party travels from town to town using a overview map of the countryside. There are many dungeons to explore and many different monsters to battle.

Again the Dark Lord Nikademus is the players' evil opponent, having fashioned an evil orb and cast a curse on the beautiful island of Ferronrah, enslaving its people. The players' mission is to find and destroy the evil orb.</desc>

This time, the Dark Lord Nikademus has set his evil sights on conquering - not only an island - but the entire world. He must be stopped, and you've chosen to undertake this difficult and dangerous quest. The basic gameplay in this game is quite similar to the system implemented in part one and part two, with several additions and enhancements. Some weapons and spells have been added. During combat, you can move each character to the front, middle, or back of the party. It's also possible to aim your spells at different ranks of the enemy. Wounds are specified by body location and extent of injury.</desc>

		<desc>Pinball Construction Set is considered the first construction set game that launched the concept and genre.  

Construct a pinball game by dropping parts onto the table (or alter the table itself). Alter world physics like gravity, bounce, kick, and speed. Paint custom backboards. Wire together targets for specials and bonus points. Finally, save creations for later, or generate a self-loading version of the table to distribute to friends (original program not needed to play).</desc>

		<desc>The first chapter in the Pinky Ponky series is an adult dating game combining elements of simulation and visual novel. The player character is a young male who is seeing an erotic dream. The game depicts his fictional encounters with various young women in different locations, and the gameplay consists entirely of selecting dialogue lines or (in advanced stages) sex-related actions. Each girl has a satisfaction bar that must be increased by choosing the right lines. Some choices won't affect that bar, while others will reduce it, sometimes drastically or instantly leading to the scenario's end. The game usually requires the player to discover near-perfect series of lines to advance to the next dating segment. Failure to do so prematurely concludes the scenario, leading to the next one.</desc>

		<desc>The third chapter in the Pinky Ponky series is identical to its predecessors visually and gameplay-wise. Like in the previous two games, the protagonist, a young man named Akira, must successfully seduce five young women in five different scenarios. The goal is to select dialogue choices and actions that would raise the girl's satisfaction meter and trigger the next scene. Failure to do so will break off the current scenario and end the game after the fifth one. The situations are fairly traditional compared to the second game, involving encounters on a train, in an amusement park, in an apartment complex, etc.</desc>

		<desc>The third chapter in the Pinky Ponky series is identical to its predecessors visually and gameplay-wise. Like in the previous two games, the protagonist, a young man named Akira, must successfully seduce five young women in five different scenarios. The goal is to select dialogue choices and actions that would raise the girl's satisfaction meter and trigger the next scene. Failure to do so will break off the current scenario and end the game after the fifth one. The situations are fairly traditional compared to the second game, involving encounters on a train, in an amusement park, in an apartment complex, etc.</desc>

		<desc>Take on the life of a buccaneer in the golden age of Caribbean Piracy! This game lets you choose from 6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented.

The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of "evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.</desc>

		<desc>The cute bounty hunter known as Popful Mail looks like she would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword. In reality Mail is having a hard time making ends meet. One day, however, she learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. Her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way.

Popful Mail is a platform action game with very light RPG elements. As the heroine makes her way through the stages she collects money from slain foes. This money can be used in shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. The game features interaction with many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as the player progresses through the game.

This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch.</desc>

		<desc>The tyrannical Wardlock has created two humanoids within his mechanical world, for his own amusement. Solo the Synthelman must lead Nejo the baby out of this nightmare and to safety.

There are four worlds to get through, Ice Zone, VegieZone, Tech Zone and Fire Zone. These are linked via teleports and all full of nasties to fend off and protect Nejo from. The Ice Zone contains oxygen bubbles which must be popped to keep you breathing well. Nejo needs feeding and taking to the showers regularly.

The game is viewed isometrically and smoothly scrolls, unlike other isometric games of the day.</desc>

		<desc>In 21th century, there are three main powers on the Earth. The free world and the communist block carried over from the 20th century; the third power is the New Communist Federation. Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite "Raiden". The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship "Septemius 1" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, "Racoon", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. You are Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship "Septemius 2" that was sent to investigate the strange disappearance.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, the player takes control of Akira Tadokoro, a 17-year-old exchange student. He attends the new school for one year only, because of his father's job. Afterwards, he'll have to go back - so there is no time to lose! The boy must do something about all those pretty girls in his school. But in order to capture their hearts, he will have to know them better... Pure is a Japanese-style adventure game that takes place entirely in the school. At each location of the school (classroom, tennis court, etc.), the player is given the same menu of commands, which are Look, Talk, Ask, Show, Move, Search, Use, and Give. Each of these commands list to a sub-menu of selectable objects; the last two deal with inventory items the player might obtain. There are no real puzzles, but at certain points the player has to do more than just try to trigger the next scene - asking the right question or showing the right item might do the trick.</desc>

		<desc>The situation at the high-school soccer club is not good, and the coach is even afraid of getting fired... that's where the hero of the game, a student named Kitayama, steps into the picture. The coach asks him to become a "beauty manager", to search out pretty girls and to convince them participate in club activities. Kitayama is aided by two other schoolmates, but the player has to do the job all by himself... The game plays similarly to its predecessor, with its Japanese adventure-style gameplay, high school setting, and the same menu commands at each location.

		<desc>The situation at the high-school soccer club is not good, and the coach is even afraid of getting fired... that's where the hero of the game, a student named Kitayama, steps into the picture. The coach asks him to become a "beauty manager", to search out pretty girls and to convince them participate in club activities. Kitayama is aided by two other schoolmates, but the player has to do the job all by himself... The game plays similarly to its predecessor, with its Japanese adventure-style gameplay, high school setting, and the same menu commands at each location. There are no item-related commands, however, but some new ones, such as "Touch".</desc>

One day he discovers several such steroids in the forest, and as he decides to inspect them, unknown flying steroids kidnap Miria. Now Georgie has to pilot a steroid himself and to rescue his beloved one.

Ray Gun is a traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down navigation, random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective, etc. The combat is usually between the player's steroids and enemy ones. Steroids can attack normally or execute special techniques. Many cut scenes feature nudity.</desc>

		<name>Ray-gun</name>
		<desc>Georgie is a young man who lives with his fiancee Miria in the quiet town of Lakeside, repairing large combat robots which are strangely called "steroids". One day he discovers several such steroids in the forest, and as he decides to inspect them, unknown flying steroids kidnap Miria. Now Georgie has to pilot a steroid himself and to rescue his beloved one.

Ray Gun is a traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down navigation, random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective, etc. The combat is usually between the player's steroids and enemy ones. Steroids can attack normally or execute special techniques. Many cut scenes feature nudity.</desc>

		<name>Relics</name>
		<desc>Relics is an action-adventure game where players take the role of a spirit who can possess different characters. The spirit appears at underwater ruins with no explanation why it became a spirit and what it needs to do. In fact, one will only find out about the story of the game when seeing the real ending. The graphic style of the game is compared to the works of H. R. Giger.

Players can possess other bodies after killing their owners, but to get the real ending, they must explore the ruins while avoiding unnecessary combat by running away or ignoring the characters they meet on their way. There is no music in the game apart from the opening and the real ending and, depending on the body possessed, players will acquire different skills and attacks.</desc>

		<desc>It is the 22nd century. Earth is invaded by a aliens, led by a gigantic robotic snake. To repel the attack, Earth's scientists construct the Replicart machine, a deadly robot snake. The player takes the role of the pilot of the Replicart.

Replicart is a single-player only Snake game variant. In each of the 300 stages you have to collect a certain amount of a substance called 'Biteslime'. Once you fulfill your quota you can enter the next stage through an exit that opens on the left side of the screen. Collecting biteslime increases the length of your snake. If the head of your snake hits a wall, an enemy or part of its body you lose a life. Replicart enhances the basic Snake game formula by adding power ups like a Time Stop, which freezes enemies, speed increase/decrease or level warps.</desc>

		<name>Riglas</name>
		<desc>The continent of Riglas is inhabited by two races: Miria and Galt. For years they have been fighting each other for dominance. Caught in the struggle between the two is the nearly forgotten Osborn race, discriminated and enslaved. Mei is a young man belonging to that races, who leaves his home village in order to free his people.

Riglas is an action role-playing game. The game is set in a vast seamless world that consists of interconnected yet varied urban, wilderness, and dungeon-like locations. The principal view is third-person with a side-scrolling flavor, similar to Western adventure games of the time. The player is free to explore most of the locations from the onset.

The game world is populated by many different types of friendly and hostile characters. Killing hostile characters increases the player's score and eventually makes the main character stronger. Killing friendly NPCs, on the other hand, may lower the score. Combat system is simple and involves approaching a character and pressing the attack button, which results in the protagonist swinging the sword.</desc>

		<name>Ring Quest</name>
		<desc>This is a fantasy text based adventure game which also has pictures of most of the locations. It contains about 100 locations and 80 illustrations. 

The Ring of Chaos has enslaved the noble sorceress, Lisa, and all space-time is threatened by its destructive influence. As bearer of the Ring of Order, your mission is to free Lisa before reality is disrupted beyond retrieval.

Ring Quest is the nominal sequel of The Quest. Ring Quest returns you to the magical land of Balema, accompanied once more by Gorn, your water-swilling strong-arm. Far to the north is your ultimate goal, the sorceress's mountain citadel. As though its shield of green lightning were not adequate, you soon encounter other obstacles, including trolls, manticores, amorous ogresses, and greedy seers.

Good mapping is amply rewarded in this adventure, where Lisa is liable to pop in at any moment to cast a teleport spell, bewitch Gorn into confusion, which can be hard to detect, or dry up your water supply.</desc>

		<desc>As the name implies, Robo Wres 2001 is a game about robots that wrestle in (what then was) the future. Six robots from six countries fight in a tournament that, apart from the robot element, is closer to American, Mexican or Japanese wrestling than the classic kind of wrestling. Each player uses three keys or buttons to execute various attacks in the classic "button masher" beat'em'up manner, with different button combinations triggering different techniques according to the proximity between the combatants. Each robot has its own arsenal of special moves. The ring is viewed from an elevated position and allows movement in two dimensions. The losing robot is turned into scrap ready for recycling, with the winner going on the next round.</desc>

		<desc>Rogue is a turn-based dungeon crawler in which the player controls an adventurer who must explore the dangerous Dungeon of Doom in order to retrieve the precious Amulet of Yendor and make it out alive. The player character starts on the upper-most level and slowly makes his way downwards.

The game uses ASCII characters to represent locations, items, monsters, and the protagonist himself. There are twenty-six different types of monsters, symbolized by their initial letters (e.g. L for Leprechaun). Monsters have different abilities and modes of attack. The dungeon and the items in it are randomly generated each time the player begins a new game. Each dungeon level contains a grid of three by three rooms and dead ends. 

Levels get progressively more complex and maze-like, and monsters grow in strength the deeper the hero ventures into the dungeon. The player character can acquire better weapons and armor, gain experience points and level up. Should the protagonist perish in the dungeon, the player must restart the game anew.</desc>

		<desc>Known in the west as Realms of Darkness, this game combines traditional RPG gameplay with some elements borrowed from text adventures. Assemble a party of one to eight characters and go on quests to gain power and riches and magical items by defeating monsters. The game consists of many scenarios, each requiring several hours of playing to be completed. Move around in the realms using your keyboard or joystick or both. Travel and explore cities, dungeons, caverns and other types of dwellings. and talk to city inhabitants. Creating characters requires that you determine their traits and abilities which are defined as six attributes: Wisdom, Intelligence, Agility, Strength, Vitality and Luck. Choose their profession or class. Your choices are Fighter, Sorcerer, Priest, Thief, Champion, Knight, Barbarian or Friar. Finally, decide what race they will be, Gnome, Dwarf, Elf or Human. Once that is done, choose the sex and type your characters name.</desc>

		<desc>Known in the west as Realms of Darkness, this game combines traditional RPG gameplay with some elements borrowed from text adventures. Assemble a party of one to eight characters and go on quests to gain power and riches and magical items by defeating monsters. The game consists of many scenarios, each requiring several hours of playing to be completed. Move around in the realms using your keyboard or joystick or both. Travel and explore cities, dungeons, caverns and other types of dwellings. and talk to city inhabitants.

		<desc>In Romancia, you are a young warrior whom the king sends on a mission to rescue a lost princess. You must leave the town and enter the dreadful monster-infested catacombs in order to complete your quest.

The game is a departure from Dragon Slayer RPG-oriented gameplay style. It tends more towards medieval-themed platformer action. The hero has hit points, can buy items and weapons, use magic, and stay in inns to recover health. However, instead of receiving experience points and becoming stronger, you simply must attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump higher.</desc>

		<desc>The female inhabitants of a poor village in Japan want to improve the technological level of their homeland. A lazy but patriotic young man who grew up in the same village agrees to organize a world-wide running competition that will hopefully bring glory to the village.

Run Run Kyōsōkyoku is an arcade-style on-foot racing game. It uses a split-screen side-scrolling view and can be player against computer-controlled opponents or in a two-player mode. The latter allows players to choose any stage, while the former follows a linear set of levels, starting in Tokyo and advancing to the USA via China and Europe. The courses typically feature platforming sections alongside flat terrain; it is usually required to jump in a timed fashion to succeed, and jumps can vary in height and length depending on how long the player holds the correspondent key. Runners would also take falling damage in certain spots.</desc>

At the heart of the game system is a map with all the possible destinations, with new ones being added as the investigation progresses. In each of these locations there is usually one or more people, whom you can question at your leisure via sober and efficient text menus.

		<desc>After the Galactic Unification War, a federation was organized among highly civilized races and the entire universe entered an era of stability.

However, the colonial planet 807, and the planet "Diome" suddenly cut off all contact with the outside, and all functions as a colonial star were completely stopped. 

Federal leaders were distressed by an unprecedented anomaly and were refraining from official announcements ... However, in a blink of an eye, the entire 807 star system became the same state as Diome, and when the planetary reconstruction inspection fleet on which the symbol of space peace "Princess Lianna" who passed nearby also disappeared, the fact became known to the entire universe and people became upset. Everybody fell into fear.

The purpose of the game is to collect and repair the parts of the heavy magnetic force confinement shuttle divided into eight, and to seal the source core of "SA / ZI / RI" again.</desc>

The game deals mostly with large-scale space battles and preparations for them. There is little focus on political management within a single country, though there are various diplomatic options available.

		<name>Schwarzschild 2 - Teikoku no Haishin</name>
		<desc>Teikoku no Haishin is a sequel to Kyōran no Ginga: Schwarzschild. The events of the game take place in 3964, four years after those of the previous game. Natural disasters and the military strategies of the Honsha Empire have turned the Jiro star cluster region into a realm of chaos and unrest. A new kingdom was established in the Somari star system, and was denied a peaceful existence following the combined military actions of the countries Lossaria and Tristia. nnnnLike its predecessor, Teikoku no Haishin is a turn-based strategy game with a heavy emphasis on actual strategy rather than tactics. Gameplay, interface, and visual style are nearly identical to those of the previous game. The player must manage finances and use resources to build a sufficiently powerful starship fleet. Diplomatic options are available as well. Once a battle phase begins, ship movement and attacks unfold automatically.</desc>

		<name>Schwarzschild 2 - Teikoku no Haishin</name>
		<desc>Teikoku no Haishin is a sequel to Kyōran no Ginga: Schwarzschild. The events of the game take place in 3964, four years after those of the previous game. Natural disasters and the military strategies of the Honsha Empire have turned the Jiro star cluster region into a realm of chaos and unrest. A new kingdom was established in the Somari star system, and was denied a peaceful existence following the combined military actions of the countries Lossaria and Tristia. nnnnLike its predecessor, Teikoku no Haishin is a turn-based strategy game with a heavy emphasis on actual strategy rather than tactics. Gameplay, interface, and visual style are nearly identical to those of the previous game. The player must manage finances and use resources to build a sufficiently powerful starship fleet. Diplomatic options are available as well. Once a battle phase begins, ship movement and attacks unfold automatically.</desc>

		<desc>SCRAP! is a game for the iPhone, following the general tradition of building-block type games where you complete lines in exchange for points. The twist that makes SCRAP! interesting is that the orientation you must complete lines in, switches at random and is highlighted along one side of the game board. In lieu of gravity, you have a given amount of time (dependent on your current level/difficulty) to place the piece before it is moved to the SCRAP! pile. Pieces can be retrieved from the SCRAP! pile (limit one per turn) and placed on the game board. Don't let the pile build up too much, or your game will come to an end.</desc>

		<desc>One day when Prill visits Bukimi forest, he finds all the villagers have all been turned into stone statues. But more worringly his sister was nowhere to be seen. As he explores the forest, he later learns that the person responsible was the Demon King Pazul. With help from his friends, Prill sets off on a journey to save both his sister and the villagers, but it won't be easy as the Demon King is determined to stop him in his tracks.
As with practically every Japanese adventure game at the time, Seilane gives you a selection of commands for you to choose. Exploration is done by moving in the 4 compass directions. Most of the time you will find yourself navigating through either a forest or cave maze. In some ways it's similiar to some of the dungeon crawling gameplay you see in first person RPGs, the only difference is the camera will always be facing in one direction which does make it easier to map out the area.</desc>

		<desc>Yoshizawa, a famous writer, is targeted by a madman. She has been receiving threatening messages for a while, and comes to you, a police investigator. You start the investigation at her house, where things take a dramatic turn when her housekeeper tells you that Yoshizawa's assistant and niece, Rika, hasn't left her room for the entire day. As you break the door, you find Rika dead on the floor. The madman has found his first victim...
Shadow Hunter is a graphical adventure game using principles common to Japanese adventures of its age, quite similar to Icom's adventures such as Déjà vu, where you have a graphical view occupying most of the screen, surrounded by a message box at the bottom and actions on the right. Unlike Icom's adventures, though, you cannot choose a verb on the right and then point a cursor on an object on the screen. Instead, ready-made actions are presented in an ad-hoc manner according to what is relevant to each screen.</desc>

		<desc>Shanghai is one of the first video game adaptations of the tile-based game played with the Chinese mahjong stones - essentially a puzzle game that has little to do with real mahjong rules.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</desc>

		<name>Shikinjou</name>
		<desc>Shikinjou, or Shikinjoh, is a puzzle game inspired by Mahjong Solitaire and Sokoban. Like most Mahjong Solitaire variants, it takes its name from a region in China: in this case, the former Imperial Palace of China, also known as The Forbidden City.

The goal of the game is to get the protagonist, who is a jiang shi by default, to the exit. To do this they must push mahjong tiles out of the way. Most mahjong tiles will disappear once they touch one or more of the same type, and these tiles will also vanish along with it. Some, like the dragon or wind tiles, are barricades that will transform any tile that comes into contact into another barricade.</desc>

		<name>Shiritsu Tantei Max - Sennyuu!! Nazo no Joshikou</name>
		<desc>Max is a private detective who is known - beside his investigative and combat skills - for his way with women. One day, he receives just the case he was hoping for: he has to travel to a remote space colony near the Sun - more precisely, to the women school in this colony. The principal of the school has committed suicide. Two agents that were sent to the colony disappeared under mysterious circumstances. It's time for Max to find out what's going on - an interesting side-quest to his main mission: have sex with as many girls as possible!

Shiritsu Tantei Max: Sennyū!! Nazo no Joshikō is primarily an adventure game. Although there are randomly appearing enemies and combat in the game, there are no character statistics of any kind, and no strategy needed for combat: Max simply has to periodically reload his gun to stay alive. The movement is done entirely on the location map, with Max represented as a small dot.</desc>

		<name>Silver Ghost</name>
		<desc>Silver Ghost is very loosely based on the Camelot cycle of legends, starring the legendary Lancelot - who, in this game, is a prince rather than a knight. Lancelot's father was killed by a demonic magician and his country overrun by his minions. The young prince must assemble a capable army and lead it to the enemy's stronghold.

The game marks the first implementation of Kure Software Koubou's trademark "gocha-kyara" ("mixed-up characters") system. Essentially it is a hybrid of a role-playing and a real-time strategy game. Initially the player controls only Lancelot himself, but soon thereafter he becomes the leader of the first team, and eventually the player is put in control of several teams containing a dozen or more soldiers each. It is possible to switch between teams at almost any time and explore different areas.

The player physically controls only the team leader, navigating him or her through interconnected overhead areas.</desc>

		<name>Snatcher</name>
		<desc>Snatcher is set in the futuristic Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence. The year is 2047. Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. 

A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs. Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked ? is it a person or a snatcher?

The player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving between locations and interacting with the environment.</desc>

		<name>Snatcher</name>
		<desc>Snatcher is set in the futuristic Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence. The year is 2047. Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. 

A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs. Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked ? is it a person or a snatcher?

The player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving between locations and interacting with the environment.</desc>

Since a "score" is kept, you can also pit each player against each other by forcing all players to start with the same cards/deck/shuffle.  

Klondike Solitaire, of course, is a game of moving cards of alternate suits onto each other in an effort to move them off the tableau.  This particular version allows you to play by standard or casino rules.</desc>

		<name>Sorcerian</name>
		<desc>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf .</desc>

		<desc>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf .</desc>

Originating in the arcades, Space Harrier is a third-person rail shooter with pseudo-3D graphics, set in the same world as Fantasy Zone. The lone titular hero fights aliens with a fireball-launching cannon, which can also be used to transform the hero into a flying rocket. The protagonist is constantly in motion, but the speed of his movement can be regulated by the player.</desc>

		<name>Spy Vs Spy</name>
		<desc>MAD magazine?s comic strip of the same name comes to life in this game which was designed for one or two players. The split-screen shows both spies at the same time. Play with a friend or against the machine.

The black spy and the white spy are out to outsmart each other before the time bell rings. Find the needed objects (money, passport, secret plans and airport door key) by searching rooms in the embassy, which include desks, file cabinets and other furniture. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance).  Traps can be disarmed with objects found in rooms (a water bucket from a firebox on the wall will disarm the bomb in the prior example).  When all the items are together in the secret briefcase, head for the airport door.

Fights ensue when both spies enter the same room and are armed with clubs.</desc>

		<desc>200 years have passed since Earth Central ended a war that began when humans made first contact with aliens. The balance of power, however, is threatened by the militaristic nation VOID, which is attempting to expel all aliens from civilised society, and by the remnants of the Earth Federation. VOID plans to wage war and take over the galaxy, but a small battalion on Jupiter's satellite Ganymede is trained to resist VOID.
The game's innovations included innovative full 3D polygonal graphics, and a mixed RPG and first-person shooter system with solid content: galactic council, planets to explore, ground missions, space combat...
A vast open world universe allows you to explore over 30 planets across four star systems in a well scripted epic space opera.</desc>

VOID plans to wage war and take over the galaxy, but a small battalion on Jupiter's satellite Ganymede is trained to resist VOID.
The game's innovations included innovative full 3D polygonal graphics, and a mixed RPG and first-person shooter system with solid content: galactic council, planets to explore, ground missions, space combat...
A vast open world universe allows you to explore over 30 planets across four star systems in a well scripted epic space opera.</desc>

		<desc>As a merchant in the distant future, you captain a starship from system to system, visiting starports to buy and sell cargo until you amass one thousand credits and retire to the quiet life.  Fuel, upkeep, and even computer access contribute to overhead expenses.  Pirates will get in your way and do costly damage to your ship or even end your career if your aim is slow.  When money runs short, however, you can always scoop fuel from a red giant star or swipe some cargo from the ship a few bays down.  If you make your deliveries on time, your reputation will bring you better fees.

The emphasis of the game is economic; ship-to-ship combat is purely a gallery shoot with moving targets and a possibility of escape.  All play is real-time, so even in the starport, your fuel is being used and delivery dates are getting closer.  Care must be taken in selecting cargo, as some runs will lose you money for the amount of fuel they consume.  Run out of fuel in mid-jump and you're space salvage.  Everything happens on one, tripartite game screen showing the view outside your ship, your status (cash, fuel, repair, date, etc.), and the graphical menu below.</desc>

		<name>Star Trader</name>
		<desc>As a merchant in the distant future, you captain a starship from system to system, visiting starports to buy and sell cargo until you amass one thousand credits and retire to the quiet life.  Fuel, upkeep, and even computer access contribute to overhead expenses.  Pirates will get in your way and do costly damage to your ship or even end your career if your aim is slow.  When money runs short, however, you can always scoop fuel from a red giant star or swipe some cargo from the ship a few bays down.  If you make your deliveries on time, your reputation will bring you better fees.

The emphasis of the game is economic; ship-to-ship combat is purely a gallery shoot with moving targets and a possibility of escape.  All play is real-time, so even in the starport, your fuel is being used and delivery dates are getting closer.  Care must be taken in selecting cargo, as some runs will lose you money for the amount of fuel they consume.  Run out of fuel in mid-jump and you're space salvage.  Everything happens on one, tripartite game screen showing the view outside your ship, your status (cash, fuel, repair, date, etc.), and the graphical menu below.</desc>

		<name>Star Trek</name>
		<desc>Star Trek is an unofficial game based on the television series of the same name. In the game the player must defeat all Klingons in the quadrant. At any moment the player can perform the following five actions from within the Enterprise:
Fire proton torpedo
Shields
Computer Map
Move
Long range scanner
In the default view the player can see the objects in the immediate surrounding of the ship: stars or Klingons. When encountering Klingons the player can fire torpedoes in order to defeat them. The player cannot move in the default view and must enter an angle at which to fire a torpedo (which flies in a straight line). If enemy torpedoes are about to hit the player must raise the shields.

Moving sends the player to a different screen, this is done by inputting an angle and desired distance. Using the computer map and long range scanner the player can try to find screens that contain objects, which can be either Klingons or harmless stars.</desc>

		<name>Still Sword For Adult</name>
		<desc>For years, the magical realm of Forfaral existed in balance thanks to the power of five princesses, protectors of its land. However, the evil sorceress Inkoma abducted the princesses and locked them in castles populated by monsters. It is up to a brave female warrior to rescue the princesses and restore peace.

Still Sword for Adult is very similar to its non-hentai counterpart visually and gameplay-wise. Like the previous game, it is an action RPG in which the protagonist explores maze-like passages and fights monsters for experience, money, and items. An added twist in this installment are erotic lesbian scenes that occur whenever the protagonist liberates the princesses.</desc>

		<desc>Super Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in SystemSoft's long-running war strategy series. The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.
The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction.</desc>

		<desc>Super Mario Bros. Special is, on the surface, a port of the original classic. However, while it may look similar, this is a completely redesigned game that plays very differently from its NES brother. The most significant difference is that it features none of the original levels; the eight worlds featured are all unique to this release, and have a high level of difficulty surpassing even Super Mario Bros. 2. Also unlike the original game, the screen does not scroll. Rather, when Mario reaches the end of the screen, he emerges on the left side of the next screen.

The game features a number of enemies and power-ups not found in the original game. Many of the enemies from Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. return, and powerups include the hammer from Donkey Kong, as well as a time bonus item and a wing that lets Mario swim through the air. The game, however, does not include Mario's twin brother Luigi nor any two-player option.</desc>

		<name>Swashbuckler</name>
		<desc>Swashbuckler is an early fighting game.  The whole game takes place on the same screen.  You're in the center and enemies such as humans, snakes, and rats come at you from either side.  You've got a sword that can strike high, low or center, or block. 

As the game progresses the number and speed of the enemies increase until they're too fast for a human to handle.

This was pretty similar to another Datamost title, "Aztec" which was an Indiana Jones type side-scroller.</desc>

Their parents want to send him abroad to study, but he can't bear to be separated from his sister. Do his feelings to his sister cross the line, becoming forbidden love?..

The gameplay in this installment follows the traditional Japanese adventure template typical for the series: at each screen, the player is presented with a large menu of verbs and objects. Usually, it is required to go through most of the options to be able to move to another location or trigger an event. There are many wrong choices and dead ends, which lead to Game Over.</desc>

		<desc>Tenshitachi no Gogo 2: Bangai-hen is a side-story of Tenshitachi no Gogo 2: Minako. The game's protagonist is the brother of Kozue Yanagisawa, one of the female characters that appeared in Minako. Their parents want to send him abroad to study, but he can't bear to be separated from his sister. Do his feelings to his sister cross the line, becoming forbidden love?..

The gameplay in this installment follows the traditional Japanese adventure template typical for the series: at each screen, the player is presented with a large menu of verbs and objects. Usually, it is required to go through most of the options to be able to move to another location or trigger an event. There are many wrong choices and dead ends, which lead to Game Over.</desc>

		<desc>The third game in the Tenshitachi no Gogo series is not connected to its predecessors story-wise. In this installment, the player assumes the role of a male teacher in a high school. Many pretty female students (and pretty female teachers) surround the hero, but he only has one girl in mind: Haru Okamoto, whom he calls "his angel". In order to win her love, the hero will have to know her better - which also means knowing the secrets of students and teachers alike...

Tenshitachi no Gogo 3: Ribbon is a Japanese-style (puzzle-less) adventure game. The player interacts with the environment by choosing verb commands ("Look", "Ask", "Search", etc.), which lead to sub-menus with object choices. The game mostly advances in a linear way, but at certain points the story can end prematurely, depending on the player's choice.</desc>

		<desc>The second Bangai-hen (a side story) in the Tenshitachi no Gogo series is set in the same environment and features recurrent characters from Tenshitachi no Gogo 3: Ribbon. The protagonist is a high-school student, who also happens to be the brother of Haru Okamoto, the main love interest in Ribbon. Like in most other games in this series, the story revolves around the main character's effort to have sex with every female character, including school mates and colleagues in part-time jobs. The gameplay is identical to the one in Ribbon or in the previous Bangai-hen: the player proceeds through still screens, typically depleting the available menu commands (verbs and object sub-menus) until a new command appears or an event is triggered. Like in most other games in the series, there are multiple dead ends and possible actions that lead to premature end of the game.</desc>

		<desc>The second Bangai-hen (a side story) in the Tenshitachi no Gogo series is set in the same environment and features recurrent characters from Tenshitachi no Gogo 3: Ribbon. The protagonist is a high-school student, who also happens to be the brother of Haru Okamoto, the main love interest in Ribbon. Like in most other games in this series, the story revolves around the main character's effort to have sex with every female character, including school mates and colleagues in part-time jobs. The gameplay is identical to the one in Ribbon or in the previous Bangai-hen: the player proceeds through still screens, typically depleting the available menu commands (verbs and object sub-menus) until a new command appears or an event is triggered. Like in most other games in the series, there are multiple dead ends and possible actions that lead to premature end of the game.</desc>

		<name>Testament</name>
		<desc>You are a soldier on an expedition to find the crypt of the ancient magus Ghuwta, the mightiest of the sorcerors and ruler of an empire 4 000 years ago. Or at least you were, until you were separated from your group. Now your task is simply to survive, and eventually find your way out of the haunted lands you are trapped in. Unfortunately, the way out seems to involve finding and defeating Ghuwta's ghost.

Testament is a horror-themed Doom clone, set outside and inside graveyards, catacombs and dungeons filled with ancient fantasy monsters. On each level you will find a scroll, a piece of the ?testament? of the title. This will allow you to save your progress and move on to the next level.

The engine is very similar to the original Doom, with no ability to look up and down, little in the way of lighting effects and bitmapped monsters. On the other hand, it does have fading light into the distance and a map overlay, and runs on an unexpanded Amiga 1200.</desc>

		<desc>A platform shooter from Japan, Thexder offers many levels and diverse enemies that gradually increase in difficulty. You pilot a Battletech-style robot capable of switching from a mech into a jet at any time. Your weapon auto-aims, but uses up a fixed amount of rechargeable energy; if you run out of this energy, you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can fire again. Your mech also contains a shield that can be activated to protect you from harm, but this lasts for a few seconds and uses up some of your life energy.</desc>

		<desc>Topple Zip is a vertically scrolling shooter that is marketed as a racing game. The basic premise is that you control an aircraft and fly in competition against several other, computer controlled crafts. In addition to shooting at your opponents, you may ram into them, and they into you. Doing so may dislodge a pill shaped power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect. 

Power-ups exist in various types, including defensive and offensive such as giving you better weapons. There are eight different levels, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other levels. How the levels connect is random each time you play the game. 

The goal of the game is to locate a key which is necessary to access the warp which leads to the eight and final level. Collect it from whichever level it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth level before any of your competitors.</desc>

		<desc>Topple Zip is a vertically scrolling shooter that is marketed as a racing game. The basic premise is that you control an aircraft and fly in competition against several other, computer controlled crafts. In addition to shooting at your opponents, you may ram into them, and they into you. Doing so may dislodge a pill shaped power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect. 

Power-ups exist in various types, including defensive and offensive such as giving you better weapons. There are eight different levels, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other levels. How the levels connect is random each time you play the game. 

The goal of the game is to locate a key which is necessary to access the warp which leads to the eight and final level. Collect it from whichever level it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth level before any of your competitors.</desc>

		<name>Treasure Island</name>
		<desc>Treasure Island is a platform game, enriched with motives from other genres.

The story begins with the hero being kept under lock and key on a ship captured by pirates. A sudden storm thwarts robbers' plans, and the ship, carried by troubled waters, wrecks on a rock. That accident results in a failure of on-board machinery, the door to hero's cell opens, he grabs the opportunity and breaks free. His first task is to get out of the ship. It won't be easy, considering all the pirates running around. When he finally manages to leave the ship, it becomes clear that it's just a beginning of his adventure. He finds himself on a strange island, full of spooky places, weird creatures and very unusual constructions...

The game consists of 13 diverse levels, and one bonus stage. The player will have a possibility to visit environments like ship's deck, sea deeps, old castle, caves, jungle, ice land, mine, and so on. Each one of these areas presents different challenges, and requires unique abilities. The player will have to run, jump, swim, fight, play the ice organ, ride a mine cart, face an ancient deity and operate unusual machines.

Also, scattered through the island is a treasure. In fact - seven valuable artifacts hidden inside the island. If the player manages to find and get them all, it will reveal an entrance to a huge vault. It's definitely worth trying...

The game features 3D pre-rendered, high resolution (640x480) art with multi-layered backgrounds (so called parallax scrolling). Also included are full motion, full screen movies played at the beginning, the end, and at key moments of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Yōko, the protagonist's girlfriend, has disappeared. In order to find her he must venture into the dreaded mansion inhabited by sex-hungry women. Though the game has a similar setting as its predecessor, gameplay-wise it is entirely different, being a first-person dungeon-crawling RPG. The environment in the game consists of several floors of identically-looking maze-like pseudo-3D corridors. There is no automapping feature. Enemies would randomly pop up; all of them are young girls, and the protagonist must have sex with them instead of fighting. Different sexual positions correspond to different types of attacks in more conventional role-playing games. Items and most other RPG-related paraphernalia are also expressed through sexual terms. Experience points and currency (which can be spent on items and resting in special locations) are awarded as well.</desc>

		<desc>Several months have passed since the protagonist of this game experienced the sexual pleasures and horrors of the mysterious mansion. One day he goes on a date with a girl named Reiko, and his girlfriend Yōko gets jealous. Returning home, the young man begins to think of his behavior and how to improve it, and gradually sinks into a dream that takes him back to the mansion and back to sex.

The third installment of the Twilight Zone series is very similar to its predecessor visually and gameplay-wise. Like the previous game, it is a pseudo-3D first-person dungeon crawler with turn-based battles against naked girls, where RPG activities are replaced by sexual positions and alike. New in this iteration is an automap feature and a point-and-click interface for the basic battle command, allowing the player to choose a girl's body part to touch.</desc>

		<desc>Aliens have invaded Earth. Seemingly impervious to damage, they took control of the planet. Only a few partisan organizations dared to oppose their rule. All the aliens look like young and attractive human women, and soon it was found out that they have a weakness to sperm. Thus, a young Japanese man and his few male allies embark on a quest to defeat the aliens by having sex with them. The fourth installment of the Twilight Zone series is not connected to its predecessors story-wise. Like the three previous games, it is an RPG where the enemies are exclusively semi-naked girls and most battle commands correspond to sexual actions. Unlike the preceding games, navigation is done in top-down view, though the battles remain first-person. Up to three characters will join the protagonist and take part in combat. There is no world map and the game is built in a fairly linear way, with only a few friendly areas where enemies do not appear.</desc>

		<desc>The game is based on the famous adult manga/anime series with the same name. It generally follows the main plot: the demon Amano Jaaku is banished from Makai (the demon world) to the Earth by the Elder, doomed to be trapped in a human body; he is given the mission of finding Choujin, the most powerful god, who is hiding in the body of a high-school student.nnnnUrotsukidōji is a Japanese-style adventure. The interaction with the game world is performed by choosing verb commands from the menu ("Look", "Talk", etc.). Navigation is also done by choosing the command "Move" and then the name of the location. Most of the time it is necessary to visit all the locations and deplete menu choices in order to advance the story.</desc>

		<desc>Volguard is a traditional shoot-'em-up. You fly a plane over a parallax-scrolling landscape, filled with enemy installations which you must bomb. An easy task, if it weren't for the enemy attack waves. Most waves consist of planes flying in a straight line across the screen, without even shooting at you. Others bounce across the screen, and some are more dangerous, as they are flying in intricate patterns and firing multiple shot. Of course, you can fire back, but keep that at a minimum. The power bar at the bottom of the screen is depleted by your cannon, and when it has reached zero, your firing rate is very low. After a while, a route comrade will join you as a kind of power-up. When a third plane joins, you may merge your fighters into a flying robot.</desc>

		<desc>Wibarm is an action game with RPG elements, and several gameplay modes. The player controls a robot who can also transform into a tank or a flying spacecraft; each form has its own strengths and weaknesses. Similarly to Thexder, the player guides the transformable robot through side-scrolling levels, shooting at enemies and trying to stay alive. However, when the robot enters a building, the game transforms into one of the earlier examples of a 3D, third-person perspective shooter. The levels culminate in boss battles, which take place on separate top-down areas.

The player is given a considerable freedom as to which locations to visit first. Collecting power units increases the robot's power. If a particular boss encounter proves to be too difficult, the player can explore other areas, level up, and return to the boss stronger than before, giving the game an RPG angle.</desc>

		<desc>Kenta is a Japanese teenager who is obsessed with superhero stories. One day, he meets a mysterious girl named Aoi. She tells him she is from a dimension called Powdream, and gives him a powerful item called Dream Note, which can fulfill wishes. Kenta is eager to realize his dreams by asking to be transformed into a superhero named Wingman. However, the dictator Rimel fears that the new hero will endanger his existence in Powdream, and swears to get rid of Kenta by separating him from Aoi.

Based on the manga by Masakazu Katsura, Wingman is an adventure game that combines text input with menu-based interaction. The player can directly input text commands, combining verb with objects. However, some commands (including location designations) are mapped to function keys. It is also possible to move the cursor on the screen to select objects. Beside the bulk of adventure gameplay, the game also features a few fighting sequences.</desc>

		<desc>The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process. The first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. The player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.</desc>

		<name>Wizardry Scenario 3 - The Legacy Of Llylgamyn</name>
		<desc>A generation has passed since your band of adventurers reclaimed the Staff of Gnilda and the armor of the Knight of Diamonds, and the land has been at peace. But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb. Legacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game. Character classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.</desc>

		<desc>World Golf 2 lets you test your skills on the green in a standard 18-hole round of golf.  Shots are taken from a first-person view of the course, in the general direction of the current hole and its flagstick; you pack four clubs in your bag (driver, 8 iron, 4 iron, and putter) to give the ball the desired loft and distance.  Each shot is further influenced by the current wind direction and speed, by the force of your stroke - determined by the power bar - and by a margin of error which will skew the shot (depending on the position of the left-side slider as you hit the button).

The three difficulty settings decide just how much these factors affect your strokes.  You can also pick a time of day for each game, although this only affects the visuals.  Like other games from the same author, this one is written for the Tandy 1000 series and requires the respective BASIC interpreter.</desc>

		<name>World Golf 2</name>
		<desc>World Golf 2 lets you test your skills on the green in a standard 18-hole round of golf.  Shots are taken from a first-person view of the course, in the general direction of the current hole and its flagstick; you pack four clubs in your bag (driver, 8 iron, 4 iron, and putter) to give the ball the desired loft and distance.  Each shot is further influenced by the current wind direction and speed, by the force of your stroke - determined by the power bar - and by a margin of error which will skew the shot (depending on the position of the left-side slider as you hit the button).

The three difficulty settings decide just how much these factors affect your strokes.  You can also pick a time of day for each game, although this only affects the visuals.  Like other games from the same author, this one is written for the Tandy 1000 series and requires the respective BASIC interpreter.</desc>

		<name>Xak - The Tower Of Gazzel</name>
		<desc>After Latok Kart defeats Zamu Gospel in the events described in Xak II, he and his friends are intrigued by rumours of a demonic tower and a Latok-like man wandering around it. 

The appearance of a fake Latok and the kidnapping of Rune Greed's family are ploys to lure the two descendants of Duel into the tower, set up by the villains Al Acrila, Gill Berzes and a demon called Zegraya.

 Using Latok and Rune, they plan to resurrect the ancient demon Gazzel, a demon with unimaginable power comparable to destroying an entire mountain in a single attack.</desc>

		<name>Xak 2</name>
		<desc>Three years have passed since the brave young warrior Latok Kart defeated the evil demon Badu, bringing peace to Xak, the world of humans. But one of Badu's servants, a sorcerer known as the Necromancer, has escaped. He plans to summon another dark being, known as the Gospel, from the demon world Zekisis to the world of Xak. Meanwhile, Latok and his companion, the fairy Pixie, are on the way to the village of Banuwa, hearing the rumor that Latok's long lost father has been seen nearby...

Rising of the Redmoon is the sequel to The Art of Visual Stage and the second entry in the Xak series. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor: Latok wanders through hostile areas, fighting enemies in action melee combat, gaining experience points and leveling up. A few options have been added, such as praying to Duel, a legendary god of war, to restore hit points.</desc>

		<name>Xevious</name>
		<desc>A hundred thousand years ago, an ancient civilization prospered on our Earth, their product being GAMP (General Artificial Matrix Producer). In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.

Xevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided.</desc>

Unconscious, he was found by a female fighter named Mei, who brought him to her house and cured him. Grateful, Tetsu promises Mei to help her venture into the huge tower standing nearby, which was built by the princess of the country and is now overrun by monsters...

X?na is a dungeon crawler very similar to early  Dragon Knight games, but without erotic content. Most of the activity in the game takes place in the gigantic maze-like tower. The player has to explore it, finding the correct way to upper floors (without auto-map feature). In town, it is possible to buy weapons and rest. The player controls only Tetsu and Mei during the entire game, as they fight random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining levels. The combat system is very simple, relying on preparation and level-building. Mei can cast healing magic, which depletes magic points (MP).</desc>

		<desc>Tetsu is a young warrior who has left his home country in order to serve human rulers in their battle against the dark elves. But one day the valiant knight was heavily wounded in battle. Unconscious, he was found by a female fighter named Mei, who brought him to her house and cured him. Grateful, Tetsu promises Mei to help her venture into the huge tower standing nearby, which was built by the princess of the country and is now overrun by monsters...

X?na is a dungeon crawler very similar to early  Dragon Knight games, but without erotic content. Most of the activity in the game takes place in the gigantic maze-like tower. The player has to explore it, finding the correct way to upper floors (without auto-map feature). In town, it is possible to buy weapons and rest. The player controls only Tetsu and Mei during the entire game, as they fight random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining levels. The combat system is very simple, relying on preparation and level-building. Mei can cast healing magic, which depletes magic points (MP).</desc>

		<desc>It is the 12th century, and the Muslim world has been split into two warring factions. Meanwhile, Muhammad's disciples are also threatened external forces ? in the west the Crusaders; in the east the Mongols. As the Persian assassin Sadler, you are given the task of murdering the Caliph, hopefully saving the future of the Islamic faith in the process, a process which will have implications ranging as far as 800 years into the future. First, however, you must find your three assassin friends and complete a range of quests, for this is an RPG.

Like many of Falcom's games, XZR (or Exile, as it is pronounced) is played in a traditional top-down view when in villages and towns, and shifts to a side-scrolling platform view when entering dungeons, castles and other action sequences. Apart from equipping your character with an arsenal of weapons and clothes in order to raise hit points and attack points, you can also quaff potions to boost your points. Mind you, these are not ordinary magical potions, but heavy drugs such as hashish, cocaine, LSD, and heroin. The effect of the drugs only lasts a short while, and too liberal usage of the narcotics will corrupt the screen, or even kill you.

Even though your party is made up of as many as four characters, only Sadler can be controlled; others do as they want and must be retrieved once they wander off to finish their specialised tasks. All battles are fought alone as well. Though magic can be used, it is seldom as strong or useful as hand-to-hand combat.</desc>

		<name>Xzr</name>
		<desc>It is the 12th century, and the Muslim world has been split into two warring factions. Meanwhile, Muhammad's disciples are also threatened external forces ? in the west the Crusaders; in the east the Mongols. As the Persian assassin Sadler, you are given the task of murdering the Caliph, hopefully saving the future of the Islamic faith in the process, a process which will have implications ranging as far as 800 years into the future. First, however, you must find your three assassin friends and complete a range of quests, for this is an RPG.

Like many of Falcom's games, XZR (or Exile, as it is pronounced) is played in a traditional top-down view when in villages and towns, and shifts to a side-scrolling platform view when entering dungeons, castles and other action sequences. Apart from equipping your character with an arsenal of weapons and clothes in order to raise hit points and attack points, you can also quaff potions to boost your points. Mind you, these are not ordinary magical potions, but heavy drugs such as hashish, cocaine, LSD, and heroin. The effect of the drugs only lasts a short while, and too liberal usage of the narcotics will corrupt the screen, or even kill you.

Even though your party is made up of as many as four characters, only Sadler can be controlled; others do as they want and must be retrieved once they wander off to finish their specialised tasks. All battles are fought alone as well. Though magic can be used, it is seldom as strong or useful as hand-to-hand combat.</desc>

		<desc>Yellow Lemon is a simple text-based simulation game consisting entirely of conversations with four school girls. The player has to type conversations topics and responses, hoping to increase the girl's "liking" parameter. Once it is high enough the girl would assume erotic poses and sexual relationship is implied. Afterwards the game switches to another girl for the same procedure.</desc>

		<desc>In the 21th century, powerful computer systems were invented. However, the humans failed to control them. Near the end of the century, one of such systems, Orion, triggered a devastating nuclear war. A few survivors found a shelter and went into a cryogenic sleep. A hundred years later, they wake up and go out onto the surface, to face a new, unknown world...

Zarth is a text adventure with graphics. Like many other Japanese games of its type, it supports text interaction as well as commands assigned to function keys (e.g. those used for navigation). The player must explore the environments and combine verb commands with objects in order to advance. The game has a day/night cycle, and certain events may occur only at a specific time.</desc>

		<desc>Zavas differs from the Japanese-made RPGs by resembling a Western-style RPG, in particular the Ultima games of its time. Retaining the characteristically Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in graphics, Zavas has little resemblance to Japanese RPGs in other aspects. It is not story- and character-driven; the player controls a knight named Mardy in the medieval fantasy land of Fargana , and is free to go anywhere, exploring the world without following a set storyline. The top-down world consists of vast wilderness areas and towns.

Similarity to Western RPGs is evident in detailed management of player-controlled party . beside the usual weapon, armor, and item management, the player must also buy food to keep his characters alive. Some of the interaction with NPCs offers choices . The enemies appear randomly. The turn-based combat is very similar to that of Ultima games, with characters freely moving around a fixed battle screen.</desc>

		<name>Zavas</name>
		<desc>Zavas differs from the Japanese-made RPGs by resembling a Western-style RPG, in particular the Ultima games of its time. Retaining the characteristically Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in graphics, Zavas has little resemblance to Japanese RPGs in other aspects. It is not story- and character-driven; the player controls a knight named Mardy in the medieval fantasy land of Fargana , and is free to go anywhere, exploring the world without following a set storyline. The top-down world consists of vast wilderness areas and towns.

Similarity to Western RPGs is evident in detailed management of player-controlled party . beside the usual weapon, armor, and item management, the player must also buy food to keep his characters alive. Some of the interaction with NPCs offers choices . The enemies appear randomly. The turn-based combat is very similar to that of Ultima games, with characters freely moving around a fixed battle screen.</desc>

		<desc>The ancient demon Jashiin has slept for two thousand years. When he awakens, he directs his wrath towards the kingdom of Zeliard, whose rulers of yore have allegedly harmed him. For 115 days, a sand rain devastates the kingdom, turning it into a desert. To complete his cruel revenge, Jashiin turns Felicia, the princess of Zeliard, into a stone. The valiant Duke Garland sets out on a quest to vanquish the demon and restore the princess to her true form. To do that, he must collect the Nine Tears of Esmesanti, which alone can reverse the terrible curse.nnnnZeliard is a side-scrolling action game with platforming and role-playing elements. The game world is divided into hostile labyrinths, which occupy its largest portion and contain maze-like passages for Duke Garland to traverse, as well as enemies that must be dealt with.</desc>

		<desc>Zoom in Space is a simple arcade-style shooting game whose pseudo-3D perspective and ship designs are both modeled after Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom.  Armed with simple twin-shot cannons, you move your ship vertically and side-to-side while enemies approach from up ahead to ram you.  Only one enemy sprite can appear at a time, so the next attacker will only appear once the current ship has been successfully dodged or shot.  Three types of enemy ships attack in a never-ending loop, and the game's only goal is to attain a high score by shooting down as many as possible before losing all three of your lives.</desc>

Gates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and the sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. The gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor: the player creates a party of six characters and explores vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting turn-based enemies and gaining levels.

		<desc>Space traveller and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a group of local adventurers who were helping him. The Gates of Another World finally takes them all to another world, known as CRON. There, a great disturbance is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from throwing the planet into its own sun.
Gates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and the sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. The gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor: the player creates a party of six characters and explores vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting turn-based enemies and gaining levels. Unlike the first game, encounters with enemies are at specific points rather than randomly.</desc>

		<desc>Known in the west as Realms of Darkness, this game combines traditional RPG gameplay with some elements borrowed from text adventures. Assemble a party of one to eight characters and go on quests to gain power and riches and magical items by defeating monsters.

Choose their profession or class. Your choices are Fighter, Sorcerer, Priest, Thief, Champion, Knight, Barbarian or Friar. Finally, decide what race they will be, Gnome, Dwarf, Elf or Human. Once that is done, choose the sex and type your characters name.</desc>

		<desc>Shanghai is one of the first video game adaptations of the tile-based game played with the Chinese mahjong stones - essentially a puzzle game that has little to do with real mahjong rules.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</desc>
