		<desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up. The game has three stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are three distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<desc>Canyon Climber consists of three non-scrolling screens that are endlessly cycled through. In the first, similar to the rivet screen from Donkey Kong, the goal is to place explosive charges on both ends of each of four bridges, using ladders to climb between them, then trigger a detonator. Goats pursue the player and can be jumped over. The second screen resembles Donkey Kong's opening level, with angled platforms and connecting ladders. Native Americans ("Indians" in the manual) on each platform shoot arrows which can be jumped or avoided. The goal is to reach the top. The objective of the third screen is also to climb to the top. Brick-dropping birds are the primary obstacle.</desc>

		<desc>The king's treasures have been stolen! As the daring young prince, your goal is to recover them all. The treasures are being kept in various castles, each one guarded by a fire breathing dragon. Each level in the game has two parts; first you will need to cross the castle's drawbridge. You will have to jump and duck the dragons fireballs as well as avoid flying arrows to reach the other side! In the second part you need to collect all of the treasures on the screen and make it to the exit while avoiding the dragon who runs across the bottom of the screen. The dragons on each level have different patterns of movement and firing, and as the levels progress will become faster and trickier.</desc>

		<name>Dungeons of Daggorath</name>
		<desc>Dungeons of Daggorath was one of the first games that attempted to portray three-dimensional space in a real-time environment, using angled lines to give the illusion of depth. The player moves around a dungeon, issuing commands by means of typing — for example, typing "GET LEFT SHIELD" or "USE RIGHT TORCH" (or abbreviations such as "G L SH" and "U R T"), gathering strength and ever more powerful weapons as the game progresses. Various creatures appear, and can often be heard when they are nearby, even when not visible. The object of the game is to defeat the second of two wizards, who is on the fifth and last level of the dungeon.</desc>

		<desc>As Tal, your job is to single-handedly clear out the aliens who have invaded a desolate and destroyed post-nuclear earth. To have any chance of this, he must locate a sacred suit of armor. Not only will this protect him from radiation, and allow him to withstand some enemy contact, it also heals him, and enables him to float.

This means that the game has two distinct styles, with your character limited to jumping, and with only rocks (located around the screens) to throw. Once he finds the suit he can fly around the ledges, shoot the inbuilt Pulsar beam, and survive within the volcanic hideout the aliens have based themselves. You will need to recharge the suit at times, and also take it off to pass through tight caverns.</desc>

		<desc>George, Lizzy and Ralph were just ordinary Americans, until an experiment went wrong, turning them into a Gorilla, Lizard and Werewolf respectively. Following this, the three of them plan to go round destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in.

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human</desc>

		<desc>Patrolman Alex Murphy was killed on the streets of Detroit. The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</desc>

		<name>Super Pitfall</name>
		<desc>Super Pitfall is a loose remake of Pitfall II: Lost Caverns, in that the object is to move Harry through the mazes to find the Raj diamond, and rescue his niece Rhonda and sidekick Quickclaw, both of whom have become lost in the caverns. However, Pitfall Harry's quest becomes tougher when he sees that the faithful Quickclaw is imprisoned in a cage and a key must be found – at which point Pitfall Harry finds that Rhonda has been turned to stone; it is here where he must locate a magic potion that will turn her back into a normal girl.

The difference in Super Pitfall, however, is that Harry must also return to his starting point after accomplishing these objectives. Like the original Pitfall, but unlike Pitfall II: Lost Caverns, Harry has a limited number of lives. This time, Harry is also equipped with a gun with which he can shoot the various deadly creatures that inhabit the caverns, but he has limited ammunition and must find additional bullets scattered throughout the game.</desc>

		<name>Thexder</name>
		<desc>A platform shooter from Japan, Thexder offers many levels and diverse enemies that gradually increase in difficulty. You pilot a Battletech-style robot capable of switching from a mech into a jet at any time. Your weapon auto-aims, but uses up a fixed amount of rechargeable energy; if you run out of this energy, you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can fire again. Your mech also contains a shield that can be activated to protect you from harm, but this lasts for a few seconds and uses up some of your life energy.</desc>

		<name>Zaxxon</name>
		<desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up. The game has three stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are three distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

heck cost of landing rights; urchase a plane; and 
ext Turn. The letters on the right are for the types of plane you can buy: Prop
plane, Airbus, DC-10, Boeing 747, and Concorde.

It's publisher, Adventure International, was well known for
several multi-platform games (including all of the Scott Adams adventures,
as well as Sea Dragon), including this one, which was originally done on the Atari 400/800, and then ported to the TRS-80 Model I/III and the Coco.

 Roger Schrag, the author, is probably even more famous for utilities he published
through Rainbow magazine... particularily his patches to the cartridge version of EDTASM+
(the editor/assembler/debugger for the Coco) to get it to run on a disk drive,
even before Radio Shack/Tandy brought out their own disk version. He did several
other extremely useful utilities as well.</desc>

In the game, you build a character, with various physical characteristics, and then build up his/her's weapons
and armor. Using hit points similiar to D&amp;D, and also adding potions to the mix, you have to battle various
challengers, gaining experience, strength, and money, so that you can afford to improve your characters weapons and armor.
It also allows you to save multiple characters that you can choose from each time you play. In the actual battles,
you use the joystick to combat your opponent. You can also create your own monsters to fight against.</desc>

		<name>Arex</name>
		<desc>Arex is a combination arcade/strategy game, with a VERY loose base
on the popular arcade game QIX. You have a ship that leaves a trail of squares behind it, and you
have to fill in a certain percentage of the screen to continue on to the next one.
If you sit in one spot too long, a chain reaction starts from your original starting
position, following your path until it catches up with your ship and kills you. Since you can
not cross your own path (or any brick-style obstacles in the maze itself on later levels),
you can trap yourself into such a position quite easily. You also have another creature that
is in the maze to start with; if you hit it while it is still in it's original form, you
can kill it off so you don't have to worry about it. On the other hand, if you let it
go (or can't catch it) before a certain amount of time passes, it will change into an
indestructable missile that all you can do with is avoid (as seen in the above
screenshot). Later levels have a bunch of bricks
already out in the playing field, creating a maze that makes it more and more difficult
to manouevre just right so that you don't trap yourself.

   Arex was programmed by Roger Schrag of Edtasm+ patch to disk fame, and published
by Adventure International (publisher of the Scott Adams adventure games, amongst others).
It was originally written for the TRS-80 Model I/III, and also ported to the Atari 400/800, as well as the Coco.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<desc>Armchair Admiral is a Coco 3 only version of the popular board game, Battleship. Written in BASIC, featuring ships from the pirate days (rather than the 20th century), and featuring up to 8 players (and any mix of human and computer players), it is done in the Coco 3's 40 column text mode, with color, and is turn based. Unlike the original Battleship, each player takes 3 shots per turn (instead of just 1). This was Eversoft's first game for the Coco.</desc>

Basically, the premise is that you are in an insane asylum, and you are trying to get out. You meet
up with a lot of interesting characters (somebody who thinks he is Napolean, another who keeps
painting doors on the walls to try and open (note: this actually sometimes works for you!), and others. The game
is partly randomized each time, so that there are several different solutions to the game, and only some will work
at any given play session.</desc>

		<name>Caladuril - Flame Of Light</name>
		<desc>Caladuril: Flame of Light is a graphical adventure game, sort of a combination of text and graphics. You move (with smooth scrolling) with the arrow keys, but you also use standard text adventure commands like GET, CLIMB, etc. The basic premise of the game is that your character Jamarend Tarinson has to stop evil from invading the valley he lives in, by finding the magical Caladuril sword, and destroying the oppressor Silmnoleh, who possesses the evil twin sword Morduril. Much more detail (and full instructions) can be found on Jeff Noyle's page... if you follow some of the links, you can get complete instructions, the background story, and even a walk-through.

Caladuril was later followed by a sequel for the Coco 3 only, with much improved graphics, called Caladuril II: Weatherstone's End. This game was first released through Diecom Products, but after Diecom left the Color Computer community, it was re-released under Dave and Jeff's own company, Oblique Triad, along with other new games and a very decent stereo sound editing program.</desc>

		<desc>Canyon Climber consists of three non-scrolling screens that are endlessly cycled through.

Goats pursue the player and can be jumped over. The second screen resembles Donkey Kong's opening level, with angled platforms and connecting ladders. Native Americans ("Indians" in the manual) on each platform shoot arrows which can be jumped or avoided. The goal is to reach the top. The objective of the third screen is also to climb to the top. Brick-dropping birds are the primary obstacle.</desc>

		<name>Cashman</name>
		<desc>Cashman is thought to be a clone of the smash cross-platform hit Jumpman (I am not sure, though - both were release in 1983 by mid-year, so for one to clone the other that fast would have been quite the feat), for one or 2 players (2 players play simultaneously).
It had more screens than the original Jumpman, though... the original C64/Atari 400/800/PC, etc. version had 30
levels, while Cashman has at least 45 that I know about. In this game, you have to collect the cash (signified by dollar signs), while dodging cats, birds, and
navigating the various screens of obstacles. Different sets of levels introduce new things
to the game play, like Super-jump screens, No-jump screens, screens with conveyor belts,
trampolines, disintegrators, invisible platforms, and more. A really nice feature of the
game is that it allows you to skip chunks of screens if you have already mastered them.

 Depending on when one bought the game, it would have been sold under the name
Computer Shack (which started with TRS-80 Model 1/2/3 games, and was quite successful
there as well), or later Michtron, which is what they renamed to in 1983. They put out a lot
of the most popular Coco 1/2 games, and usually the ones with innovative game play and concepts, and
several (including Cashman) were huge and gave the player a lot of diversity to keep them busy.
Cashman was also one of the 'European/Australian' friendly games, in that you
could change the color set so that the game could be played in color on PAL TV sets (PMODE 4 artifact
colors show up as just black and white on PAL TV's... similiar to running the same game
on a Coco 3 with a CM-8 RGB monitor).

Another innovation by Computer Shack/Michtron is that they sold other companies games as well
(including Spectral Associates, Tom Mix, Med Systems, Computerware, etc.), and their magazine ads had
screenshots of most of them, and they also did a top 10 most popular games each month. Of course, their own
usually were near the top...</desc>

destroy it and mutate to the next level, all within a time limit. If you try to do any of the captures out of order, you die.</desc>

		<desc>Catch 'Em, like Popcorn, is based on an old arcade game called Avalanche. Using the joystick, one has to
try and catch all of the falling shapes without letting them hit the bottom of the screen. Each time one does
make it to the bottom, you lose one of your platforms, making it harder. There are
multiple waves of different shapes to go through; the first shape is shown in the above screenshot.

		<desc>Cave Walker is a sequel to the earlier, Spectral produced cartridge from Radio Shack called Downland. Cave Walker is much larger (at least
25 different caverns, as opposed to Downland's 10), and is more complicated. It also was OS-9 based, and had some special
color options for the Coco 3, if run under OS-9 Level II. It also allowed one to save several games in progress, and featured a
practice mode (although, one could not get into 9 of the caverns if playing in this mode).

Cave Walker also was different in that it actually used the analog joysticks as analog; the more you moved the joystick to the
side, the further you would jump when you hit the fire button. It was also one of the earliest games that had instructions on how to install it
on a hard drive (along with Spectral/Tandy's Interbank Incident).</desc>

		<name>Caves Of The Unwashed Heathen</name>
		<desc>Caves of the Unwashed Heathen is an original 3D graphical adventure game, based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The Coco 1/2 version runs a little bit slower, and uses the fixed palette of the machine, as you quest through multiple levels of the dungeon, gathering treasure and fighting monsters in your ultimate quest to defeat a dragon. The Coco 3 version runs a little faster, and adjusts the palette (for composite only, it looks like) to make it more "dungeony" (is that even a word?). Like D&amp;D, it features hit points, attributes, character classes, weapons, armor and spells, and you level up as you go through more battles. It uses the low res graphics/text screen, and does quite well with the 3D hallways, doors, monsters etc. It even lets you look at the map while playing, and saving/loading multiple games to disk. On the Coco 3, you have the option of it creating a RAM disk to speed some of the loading and saving; however, make sure that you copy those to a real floppy or disk image, or they will be lost on reboot.</desc>

You can change skill level, colors, swap sides, skip moves, adjust the amount of random play by the computer, toggle sound on/off, and changing each piece ahead of time. The skill levels have some logic to them, too: level 0 is completely random moves (meant for children, according to the instructions), and even/odd numbered levels are based on the number of moves ahead, and whether it uses classic opening moves,etc. It also has a time indicator, and a confidence indicator that starts once memorized openings are completed and it starts actually analyzing.</desc>

		<desc>Chopper Strike is based on the arcade hits Scramble and Super Cobra. Unlike the original arcade games,
Chopper Strike is set up as one continuous map of terrain, rather than being broken into separate levels. Also added is that you
are trying to rescue soldiers with your helicoptor, rather than just trying to blow things up and getting fuel.
The game was sold with two versions included: A smaller map version for 16K machines, and the full version for 32K. The full version
had the equivalent of 105 screens placed end to end. Another difference from the arcade originals is that you
don't drop arcing bombs; you fire actual missiles that keep going straight, and which you can angle to fire up or down
diagonally, as well as straight across.</desc>

Each of the 3 games also have 4 skill levels each, and you can restart a game at any time (or even exit the game to the main attract/menu screen.

		<name>Clowns And Balloons</name>
		<desc>Clowns &amp; Balloons is a clone of the old arcade game Circus (1977), except with better graphics
and sound. It is an arcade style game by Steve Bjork, where you control the two people
holding the trampoline at the bottom of the screen, and you must keep the clown bouncing around
to pop all of the balloons scrolling (in different directions) at the top of the screen.
When the clown first starts bouncing, he doesn't go very high; the longer you keep him going, the higher he will bounce.
You can bounce the clown off the walls too; but not off the floor (you lose a life at
that point). One cute thing about the game is that plays little blips of circus style music
each time you complete popping a row of balloon; this also gives you a small breather.</desc>

		<name>Color Computer Clue</name>
		<desc>Color Computer Clue is version of the popular board game Clue. It was originally written in 1982 for the Coco 1;  Larry re-did it for the Coco 3 using John Kowalski's (Sockmaster) VDG emulator (which does 32x16 text on the Coco 3's 320x192 screen, making the characters even larger and easier to read). He later went back and fixed up the Coco 1/2 version a little, and made a loader that allows one to pick the version to run, if you have a Coco 3, or run the Coco 1/2 version if that is what you have. The goal of the game is to solve a murder, by figuring out in what room, with what weapon, who the killer was. This involves deducing, through cards between the computer player and you, and travelling between the rooms, which rooms/weapons/suspects to exclude.</desc>

		<desc>Color Cubes is a keyboard controlled game that basically duplicates the (in?)famous Rubiks Cube puzzle.
This game came out when the physical cube's craze was still running high. I personally found it a little to
awkward to use, compared to the real cube. One nice feature, though, was that it allowed
you to save your cube in progress, so that you could continue where you left off at a later date.</desc>

		<name>Color Invaders</name>
		<desc>Color Invaders was one of the first commercial clones of Space Invaders, along with the Spectral Associates version. It's main claim to fame (other than how early it was released for a 3rd party game) is that it cloned the Atari VCS (later called Atari 2600) version of the game, and not the arcade game, as one can tell by the look of the invaders... they are almost identical. I believe that the same author who did the original Pac-Tac did this game; the sound routines for blowing up aliens and eating the ghosts in Pac-Tac are the same.

It should be noted that a revised version with a copyright of 1982 was released that supported 2 players (taking turns). The original 1981 release had no option for 2 players.</desc>

		<name>Conquering Armies</name>
		<desc>Conquering Armies is a graphical strategy simulation, similar to the board game Risk, where you try to take over countries on the "world" map. You have 4 different types of troops: Knights, Light Cavalry, Men-at-arms, and archers. You can create armies of combinations of these, to attack the other countries. There is a bit of a real time element as well. A little green dot signifies an opposing army, and you get to watch them traverse the terrain to get to your city and attack. A little blue dot (once you assemble an army) is yours, and you control it with the joystick, to get to opposing castles. If you defeat a castle, some of the populace will join your army. Going to battle is basically run by the computer; you simply press keys to continue the battle, or retreat, depending on how things are going. The map shows your territories in yellow; the opponents are in green. Double castles are capital cities with much strong armies.</desc>

animated graphics scattered throughout... although it also adds 2 channel sound to the mix. The game is based on the
hit TV series of the time, Dallas, and pits you against J.R. as a private detective working for
Sue Ellen. The game is quite enjoyable, and has a very good sense of humor. The game was ported to many 8 bit platforms,
and solutions to the game can be found on the web to this day.

  Besides the addition of sound, the game also added in some other features over it's predecessor, including a list of Clues
that you could ask for if you got stuck.</desc>

plant (after disabling the power to the plant on the 10th floor), starting on the first floor. You will face various obstacles, including bouncing donuts, moving platforms,
falling sugar clumps, dissolving floors, and others. Nick originally did this game on the Model I/III, but greatly enhanced the graphics and sound
for the Coco version. If the game is run on a Coco 3, it auto-detects it, and changes some of the palette settings (see the RGB
screenshot of level 1 above) to make it easier on the eyes than the default 2nd color set for the 128x192x4 color mode the game uses.

The game used a rather odd key sequence to fire your dough (used to destroy donuts): the up and down arrows, as well
as the left or right arrow, had to pressed at the same time. This does NOT seem to work properly on the current Mac version of MESS (B10). The
game also features a practice mode, which does not count your high scores (it keeps track of the top 10 for your current session).</desc>

		<desc>Doodle Bug is a clone of the arcade game Lady Bug. Loosely based on Pacman, you have to
eat all of the dots in the maze while avoiding bugs coming from the center house. There is a timer
that continuously runs, and at certain times, any letters or hearts on the screen will change colors.
If you get the hearts when they are white, you will increase your points multiplier (as seen in the upper
right of the screenshot). If you hit the letters when they are the color of the words
'Special' or 'Extra', you eventually spell out the entire word, and then get large bonuses or free men.
The most innovative part of the game is the turnstyles; only you can rotate them. You can use
this to virtually design your own maze on the fly, and to thwart bugs that are chasing you (unlike Pacman,
the bugs can always match your speed). You also can NEVER hit the skulls scattered throughout. A fun game.

An innovation unique to Doodle Bug is that you can select how many men you want
to start the game with, from 3 to 6.</desc>

Doubleback is an original game which is a lot of fun. The object is to enclose objects with the line you draw,
to collect points and eliminate them from your screen (except skulls, which can never be eliminated, and there can be
up to 10 of them on the screen at once). Some objects are stationary, some can move on one axis only, and
others can move in 8 directions, of varying speeds. If the object can move, it will always move towards you.

The secret to getting high scores in the game is to circle as many objects as possible at one time; you will
get the # of points per object times the # of objects encircled for EVERY object within the loop; If you have
10 objects worth 100 points each, you will get 10*100 for EVERY object, for example. If you wait long
enough, you can get tens of thousands of points in a single shot this way.

A very fun game that is easy to learn, it also could run even on a 4K Coco... I believe one of the last
games by Radio Shack to do so. It is also one of the games that really makes use of the fact
that Radio Shack used analog joysticks; you could very your speed (and the length of your line)
to 64 different settings on both axis. Really young kids even like to simply draw with it,
and not worry about circling objects.
Interesting trivia - the working title for the game (before Tandy got it), was "Superfly and the Amazing Chomping Things".</desc>

You will have to jump and duck the dragons fireballs as well as avoid flying arrows to reach the other side! In the second part you need to collect all of the treasures on the screen and make it to the exit while avoiding the dragon who runs across the bottom of the screen.

Some people have mentioned to me that the arrow key routine (used to go North, South, etc.) is actually
latched into the BASIC interpreter itself; if you RESET after playing the game, it is still active.
I haven't actually tried this myself.</desc>

		<desc>Football is one of the earliest games that Radio Shack/Tandy released for the Coco 1 in 1980.
Requiring 2 players, it is standard American football, with plays being selected by the two players
simultaneously on the same screen by press the joystick button when the play you want is selected. Until both
players hit a button, though, you can keep reselecting to throw your opponent off from knowing
which play type you have picked.

Each player gets to control a specific player (while the rest of the players follow the play type you selected),
and the offense will change who is controlled during a passing play. The game had a cute bit for getting a touchdown; the
player that got the touchdown would throw the ball at the ground and do a little dance.</desc>

The game itself came with a little comic book that described all the stages of the game, and the game
actually adds some songs and speech if you have the Sound/Speech pak. The game has 7 or 8 stages,
of which 4 are pictured above. Basically, you have to collect map parts (designated by white squares),
until you finish completing the map of the next level, after which you actually go to the next level.
You face a variety of obstacles along the way, including sharks, natives shooting you with
crossbows, boulders, pits, etc. The game itself plays in a pseudo 3-D landscape, similiar
to Steve's earlier smash, Zaxxon. The ultimate goal is to escape aboard your outrigger canoe, with a hot

If you are already a master, you will find the computer a challenging opponent, especially at the higher levels.</desc>

		<name>Graphic Mars</name>
		<desc>Graphic Mars is a reworking of the original Mars/Mars II text based adventure game written in BASIC from Aardvark software. Roderick Smith re-programmed it for graphical displays (from Rodger Olsen's original text version), bumping the memory requirement from 16K to 32K. Otherwise, the game is identical, and is one Aardvark's beginner games. Converting adventure games from text to graphics was a trend started by Mark Data Products, when Bob Withers and Stephen O'Dea converted Ron Kreb's original Calixto Island and Black Sanctum games to graphics as well.</desc>

		<desc>Ice Master is a clone of the arcade game Pengo. In it, you have to try and crush your
opponents (in this case, they are mosquitoes) by crushing them between chunks of ice. You are only
strong enough to push single chunks, so if there are several in a row, you can't push them.

This is another of M.G. Lustig's games that he published with his own company.
An amusing part of this game is if you hold down the fire button to push a block of ice... your character does a nifty
little jig!</desc>

		<name>Klendathu</name>
		<desc>Based on Robert A. Heinlein's Hugo-award winning book, Starship Troopers, this game simulates the brief combat life in M.I. (Mobile Infantry) far in the future. The Terran Federation is locked in a deadly war with "the Bugs," and has announced "Operation Bughouse," an attack directly on the Bugs' home world of Klendathu. Equipped with a state-of-the-art power suit, you drop in from orbit and and torch as many Bug warriors as possible, then bounce back out before your suit runs out of energy or the Bugs overwhelm you. Survive three drops and you can retire, with pay based on how many Bugs of each rank you blasted.

Game play consists of carefully selecting which block of the drop zone to land in, and then blasting the warrior and queen Bugs as they advance down the screen toward you. For each warrior and queen you might see, however, there are many more harmless worker Bugs, which look exactly like the warriors. They're all swarming toward you; choose your targets carefully and don't waste your ammo. You'll know the warriors because they're the ones shooting at you.</desc>

		<desc>The basic premise to the game is that you have a time limit in which to solve a plane, by getting to the finish area. You steer the 8-Ball around to do so, and in most levels you can also jump.
There are all kinds of obstacles in your path: bonus shapes, deadly shapes, one way pipes, acid pools, invisible walls, etc. You also occasionally have to pick up keys and amulets as well. Some planes actually
have sub-planes as well that you must go through. I nice thing about the game is that you can start on any plane; you do not have to go through them all to try
a higher level one out. The square marked 'GOAL' is usually the one you have to land on before time runs out...</desc>

		<name>Pac Droids</name>
		<desc>Pac Droids is one of the most innovative "Pac" style games for any platform. Like most Pacman clones, you navigate a maze
eating dots, but unlike others, their are mines, and you can shoot your opponents. The mazes are a lot smaller than most Pac games too. It also has a twist when you eat the power pellets (Grabber by Mike Hughey also used a version of this feature)... you can only run over your opponents (when energized) that are red... The blue saucer will ALWAYS destroy you on contact. On the other hand, if you shoot (you have 3 shots to start), you will destroy everything in the direction you fire until it hits a wall; this includes, dots, energizers, the mines they lay out for you, and all of your opponents. Another rather unique aspect of the game is that it allowed up to 4 players to take turns (unlike the usual 2). I believe that this was Charles Forsythe's first major arcade release... it pre-dated Ninja Warrior.

It should be noted that the introduction and game selection screen will not work properly on a Coco 3 (it uses an unsupported Semi-graphics mode), but the main gameplay itself will.</desc>

		<desc>Panic Button is an original arcade style game by First Star Software. Originally released on both the Vic-20 and the Coco by First Star itself, it was soon licensed to Radio Shack, and sold as a cartridge game. The object of the game is to assemble the various parts into the correct final product, and you have to assemble them in order, by catching the various pieces as they travel down the conveyor belts. You also 
 have a Panic Button (seen in the upper right of the above right screenshot) that will temporarily halt the production line, and give you a little bit of time to catch up. After you complete your order (which is so many of whatever object your are building), then you progress to the next level, which becomes faster and faster.
 
Panic Button, while still being sold directly by First Star Software, was one of the few titles that were not from Radio Shack that were availble in cartridge format.</desc>

die if either of you hit the water). The game is also divided into phases (sets of waves), and the waves themselves.
Like Lancer, it supports one or two players, and the players can (and, on some waves, are encouraged to) kill each other.</desc>

		<desc>Pinball Factory is a game where you can design your own pinball game. It is more sophisticated than the earlier
Radio Shack cartridge version of Pinball, in that you have more varied things to put onto the pinball board, and more control over
the physics of the ball. You can also design your own splash screens for them as well. Also unlike the original, you can save your pinball games to disk
(instead of cassette), and you can have up to 4 players at once. The game came with eight pre-built boards, and you could fill endless disks with your own
designs.</desc>

		<name>Pitfall 2 - Lost Caverns</name>
		<desc>Pitfall II was the first sequel to the smash, cross platform hit Pitfall from Activision (The Coco never had the first one officially; unofficially, Ken Kalish's Trapfall is a very close clone). The biggest difference with Pitfall II is that you are no longer limited to horizontal motion (well, some vertical movement was allowed in the original, but only within the same screen)... there are literally dozens of smooth scrolling, vertical screens to go through, as well as the traditional horizontal screens. Like the original, you are trying to collect treasures, and dodge various dangers. Expanding on the original is underwater areas, and "checkpoints", which allow you to sort of save your position somewhat, without having to go through the whole maze again. 
Pitfall II also has a hidden feature originally designed to allow PAL based Coco's (European and Australian) to run the game in color; hold down the  key while it is booting. This has the added bonus of allowing Coco 3 users to use 4 PALETTE commands before loading the game, and getting back your artifact colors, or even setting your own. Just change PALETTE's 4 to 7 (4 is normally black, 7 is normally white, and 5 and 6 are red/blue).</desc>

		<name>Planet Raider</name>
		<desc>Planet Raider is based on the arcade smash hit, Defender, but has some differences. You are flying over a planet, trying to rescue humans, but the humans don't get picked up by aliens (you have to pick them up off of the ground, like in Broderbunds Choplifter for other platforms). All aliens are stationary on the terrain (except for one type of ship that will launch and try to kill you), but some of them are firing at you. You can also shoot the humans by accident, and fly in all directions (like Defender). The terrain (and the objects on them) are in a fixed pattern... if you clear out half of the mountain range, and die, when you get your next life everything will be empty until you fly back to the point you were killed at. A bigger difference is that after you have rescued all humans (and it is not necessary to destroy all the aliens), you have fly off the top of the screen to complete the wave. If you have destroyed all aliens and rescued all humans, but do not fly off the top, you will fly around forever on an empty planet.

The skill level makes a huge difference in the game. The Easy level has fewer shots from the enemies, and the aliens that do launch at you are not very aggressive. The Hard level lets the aliens have more shots, and the launching aliens are much more aggressive. Impossible is close to what it says; unlike the two easier levels (where you fly through the mountains), on this skill level, if you touch a mountain at all, you instantly die. You select the skill level by moving the joystick up and down, and then hitting the 'R' key to restart the game.

Unlike most other Dave Edson games, there are no hidden messages in the code.</desc>

		<name>Poltergeist</name>
		<desc>Poltergeist is based on the hit movie of the same name... one of the rare official movie/tv adaptations done for the Coco.
There are basically three sub-games: On the first level, you have to navigate the streets,
collecting objects like rope, tennis balls, etc., while dodging traffic. After you gather all of the objects,
you must then get to the house where the poltergeist is... and it wanders around the whole
time. You only have 30 seconds to do all of this.

On the 2nd level, you have to get to the top of the stairs, while dodging all the objects
that the poltergeist has caused to move back and forth on the stairs. You also have to dodge the
poltergeist itself, which will track you down, but has to pause when it collides with objects.

On the third and final level, you are in a 3D moving energy field, and you have to shoot the poltergeist so many times to
destroy it. But, sometimes it is Carol Ann who appears out of the darkness instead, and if you
shoot her, you lose the game. Quite a challenging game.

Of special note: There is a known bug (cheat) on the first level: If you hold down the joystick
button, NO cars will come out. This makes this level a lot easier!</desc>

On the second level, they ascend on balloons that take up to 3 hits to pop, until enough of them gather on the top to push a rock onto you. There are also bonus levels where the wolves hurl fruit and vegetables at you, which you try to shoot for bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>Pyramid 2000 is one of 3 machine language text adventure games that Radio Shack originally brought out on the TRS-80 Model I/III series, and then converted to the Coco (the others being Bedlam and Raaka-Tu). This is the hardest one out of the series in my opinion, with some randomly shifting rooms and mazes to deal with, and objects that will react differently depending on other objects that you are carrying or even just in the same room.

In this game, you have to navigate through the pyramid and try and find all of the treasures, and bring them back to the entrance way (you do get points for finding them, but you get more if you bring them back to the entrance). I am still confused as to why all 3 games in the series, which play identically between the original TRS-80 Model I/III versions and the Coco versions, all got completely new artwork for their manuals, unless just to differentiate which platform they are for.</desc>

		<desc>The latest breakthrough in nuclear power is broken. It's the network, of course. In the dazzling future of the late 1990's, the world's first fusion reactor is online: energy particles are shooting out of emission tubes toward the energy posts... and missing. As each one passes the posts and strikes another tube on the opposite side of the core, the reactor moves one step closer to meltdown. The reflectoid is there; that's the solid energy deflection device which bounces the particles into the posts.

		<name>Sands Of Egypt</name>
		<desc>Sands of Egypt was the first disk only game that Radio Shack ever sold for the Coco. It was also the first game in
their "Animated Adventure" series (the 2nd was The Dallas Quest). Featuring a fairly normal adventure game interface,
with animated graphics scenes, and the ability to save/load up to 9 games at once on the original disk, it started a whole slew of animated graphic
adventure games for the Coco (aside from the Radio Shack ones, other companies like Mark Data Products came out with games of the same type... some
of them even managed to cram this onto casette games).
The game had many types of animation; scrolling clouds and terrain (multi-plane yet!), an animated camel that chewed, blinked and hopped, rivers, and other things. The object
of the game was to find the treasure room of the pharoah, and claim the riches contained in it.
Sands of Egypt was also a cross platform game, that Datasoft ported to several different computer systems during the early 1980's. It was also one
of the first games (and the first from Radio Shack) for the Coco 1/2 that pushed artifact colors past the normal
four (black, red, blue, white) that most games used during the Coco 1/2 era. It was also the first copy protected Coco disk that Radio Shack sold.</desc>

The game was originally sold by Synapse Software itself (who also sold Atari 400/800 and Commodore 64 versions), but was later

		<name>Skiing</name>
		<desc>Skiing is a 3 dimensional downhill skiing game. You have to navigate through sets of flags to
the finish line as fast as you can. The position of the flags and hills is random, and you can generate new random courses from
the main menu. You can also set the mode of play: simple or complex. In simple, moving the joystick forward speeds you up forward,
pulling all the way back slows you to a stop, and left/right steers. Your maximum speed is not
too high in this mode, so you can steer fairly easily, but wt will take you at least 1:10 to 1:30 to get to the finish
line. In complex mode, hitting the joystick button is the equivalent of you giving yourself a thrust with
your ski poles; now you can go MUCH faster, but your steering at high speeds is not very good. If you ram the button, you
can make it to the finish line within 15 seconds. Unfortunately, if you go off course, or miss steering
between flags, your score will not count.

A unique element of Skiing: it was one of the few cartridges designed to run on either 4 or 16K machines
that actually changed in operation depending on the memory you had. In 16K, the screen updates were quite smooth
from page-flipping (now called double-buffering, I believe) techniques, but in a 4K machine it had just
a single page, always displayed available; this caused the game to flicker quite a bit on a 4K machine. Skiing was
also one of the first (if not THE first) Coco game to feature voice synthesis ("Get ready, Get Set...;")</desc>

Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.</desc>

		<name>Space Intruders</name>
		<desc>Space Intruders I believe is the first machine language game that Charles Forsythe did for the Coco, and the first machine language game that Adventure International did for the Coco as well. It is also one of the rare machine language games that runs on a 4K Coco 1. Looking at old Adventure International catalogs, it looks like Charles may have done a BASIC 4K Space Invaders clone early (around the summer of 1981), and then this machine language one by around October/November 1981 - but it could also be read to just mean that 4K Standard BASIC was required and the latter was just a name change (Computerware already had a Color Invaders that came out in January of 1981). Irregardless, since this game used keyboard controls, it could be played on a stock 4K Coco with just a cassette player... nothing else was required.

The game itself is kind of a Space Invaders and Galaxian hybrid. The player moves back and forth on the bottom and can only have one shot in the air at a time. The formation of red and white aliens move back and forth like Space Invaders (although faster than the arcade version) but they don't fire at you. But one will peel off (changing color to blue and yellow) and dive bomb (ala Galaxian) and will fire upon the player. The player can earn extra ships (I am unsure if this is score based or wave based), and on later waves you will get 2 dive bombing aliens at a time (it may go higher than that the further you progress. The red and white aliens in formation are only worth 1 point; the dive bombing ones are worth 5.

Like Gauntlet by Britt Monk, Space Intruders features good action and surprisingly good sound for a tiny 4K game.</desc>

others can change direction), and you can shoot the web, but only very small portions at a time. The challenge is
to not get trapped.
The game also had "different" than normal joystick controls; left and right rotated you, and
forward and back thrust you forward or backwards (you don't just travel in the direction you point the joystick at).</desc>

There are 3 levels; the first level (pictured above) consists of meteors that you must destroy before they hit your convoy ships. On later levels, actual alien craft are added to the mix, and some of them will steal the convoy ships, splitting your convoy all over the place, and making it very difficult to guard them all.</desc>

		<desc>Sub Battle Simulator is a cross platform simulation of Submarine battles taking place during World War II.

You had to combat submarines, surface ships and aircraft, and there were multiple missions to choose from; in some you were on the Axis side, and others, the Allies. The map screenshot above is from one in the Pacific, near Indonesia. The simulation was quite complex and realistic, and made very good use of the 320x192x4 color mode.

		<name>Super Bustout</name>
		<desc>Super Bustout is one of the first games programmed for the Cocothat came out from Radio Shack. Originally programmed in 1980, it was found to have some minor bugs and changes required... and fixing those made it slightly too big from the ROM size Tandy was willing to use. So it's author Glenn Sogge had to spend some time figuring out how to crunch the code down to fit.
The game actually added a few elements to the standard Brickout style games of the time... you had the option to add
gravity (the ball would curve in arcs, instead of just bouncing straight), and some layout changes. It also allows
you to select the number of balls per game (from 1 to 20), and allows vertical AND horizontal motion of the paddle.
A side note: Glenn remembers that Super Bustout sold about 300,000 copies... this would include the Coco and the
TDP-100, which used to bundle it with the computer.</desc>

		<name>Tutankam</name>
		<desc>Tutankam is based on the arcade game Tutankham. Basically, you have multiple levels of mazes
to go through, picking up treasures, killing monsters, using warp tunnels, trying to find all of the keys so that you can
unlock all of the doors to get to the next level. Each level is larger than the previous. Unlike the original arcade game (where you
could only shoot left or right), you can shoot in all 4 directions in Tutankam. You also have super-bombs that will
destroy all monsters on your currently visible screen, although you only have three of them. You also have a map on the right,
which you can use to find your way through the maze, as well as track monsters. There are at least 4 levels
that I know of, of which two are shown above.

Like most other Dave Edson games, there are hidden messages in the code... in Tutankam's case, a lot of them! Some of them
are actually set up to 'hold' on the screen if you use a FOR/NEXT loop to dump the characters to the screen. You can
find these messages at the following offsets in the .BIN file:
Offset $1976-$19b5
Offset $1a10-$1aab
Offset $1afb-$1b63
Offset $20ab-$20e3
Offset $2a44-$2a60
Offset $2c36-$2c6b (pyramid code - take each character, and translate it so it is one character lower in ASCII table)
Offset $2f41-$2f69
Offset $384a-$386d (If I remember correctly, dumping more memory before &amp; after actually caused this message to stay on the screen for a bit, before the program gets dumped again!)
Offset $3c3b-$3c45 (hint for pyramid code)
Offset $3d8f-$3e08</desc>

		<name>Varloc</name>
		<desc>Varloc is based on the cross platform smash Archon, which is itself based somewhat on Chess. Like the original
version, you play on a board similiar to Chess, with different pieces that can move in different ways. Also like Archon, when
two pieces meet in battle, the screen changes to a battle scene, where an arcade style game starts.
Unlike Archon, however, Varloc took the battle scene even further: you battle against your opponent in real time on a 3-D floating
platform... if either of you fall off, you die. Some characters can jump and fly, so it becomes true 3-D when a spider jumps over your Dwarf's axe, for example.
Some of the pieces can even transform themselves into other creatures, and gain their powers. The ultimate goal is to defeat the Wizard (equivalent to a King in
regular Chess). Please note that different pieces have different endurance in battle; a really good player could conceivably kill a much stronger opponent (the equivalent
of a pawn defeating a queen, for example). Also hidden on the board is a special Gem; whomever possesses it can defeat the Wizard with a single blow. This is one
of Greg's better games.</desc>

		<name>Venturer</name>
		<desc>Venturer is a clone of the arcade game Venture. There are two basic areas in Venturer: The main hall
(where you can not fire back), where you have to dodge roaming monsters to get into the four rooms, and the
four rooms themselves, where you can attack monsters back, and have to collect treasures. Once you kill
a monster, it becomes a cross for a few seconds... if you collide with the cross, you die. Also,
if you linger in one of the treasure rooms for too long, some indestructable lines will come down. If you get
hit by one, you die, and they can also cut you off from the exit (an example of this
is shown in the screenshot on the lower right). This last bit is a bit different than the original
arcade game; in the original, an indestructable monster that can fly through walls (similiar to the "Evil Otto" character
from the arcade game Berzerk) came to kill you instead.
Unlike most other Dave Edson games, there are no hidden messages in the binary for this game.</desc>

were written in Extended BASIC at the time, this one offered a 4 level, 144 location maze in which
one has to clean out a spaceship infested with killer robots. The ultimate goal is to arm
the space ship to self destruct, and then get off of it before it does blow up. It allowed switching from
the 3-D view shown above to a floor map as well.

Of special note is that this is the first Coco game that Avalon Hill every released.</desc>

		<name>Warlocks Revenge, A</name>
		<desc>A Warlocks Revenge is a graphical Dungeons and Dragons style game for the Coco 3 only, done mostly in BASIC. It is very ambitious for a BASIC game, and mixes 320x192x16 color graphics for the outside map, switches to 80x24 hardware text for things like HELP and battles with monsters, and 640x192x4 color graphics for inside dungeon scenes, which are done with a 3D view, and multiple panes of information. It mixes some joystick/mouse based play on the outside world, and switches to a VERB NOUN type (like a text adventure) when you are inside the dungeon. It also allows saving and reloading games in progress. It mixes graphics, text, multiple fonts, palette animation (in the title screen and outside world navigation), and even a HELP command when you are in the text parser areas of the game. Ambitious as it is, it does suffer from the slowness (especially in some of the graphics drawing) of BASIC, but is a very valiant attempt, nonetheless. It does have some palette animations on the outside world map screen that seem superfluous and actually distracting (and distracts you from the game), but the rest of the game is very well presented. Your main mission is stock up on supplies and weapons, and make your way to the Isle of Dread (in a large lake) and defeat Tiamat. As the instructions mention, its weapon and stats system is very much based on TSR's Dungeons and Dragons role playing game.
I don't know who wrote this, but Snailsoft is a company name that has also been used by Greg Zumwalt, although he usually did machine language games, and not BASIC. So I am not sure who the actual author is.</desc>

		<name>Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego</name>
		<desc>Carmen Sandiego is a master thief who leads the criminal organization V.I.L.E. This organization specializes in stealing the world's treasures without a trace. Alarmed by this, the A.C.M.E. Detective Agency makes it their personal mission to foil Carmen Sandiego's plans.

Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? is a game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away.</desc>

		<name>Zaxxon</name>
		<desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up. The game has three stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are three distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

		<desc>Zeus is an original arcade game, where you a wizard battling Zeus (the god), armed with a "Cone of Cold". The first 4 rounds, you have to shoot lightning bolts that come at you; starting on wave 5, there are clouds added (and they later start moving) that you can't stay under for too long. You have a power indicator, and the more often you fire, the more this gets used up (and the shorter range your blasts have), so you can't just fire constantly. You also have a shield, but that doesn't last forever, either.</desc>

		<desc>The latest breakthrough in nuclear power is broken. It's the network, of course. In the dazzling future of the late 1990's, the world's first fusion reactor is online: energy particles are shooting out of emission tubes toward the energy posts... and missing. As each one passes the posts and strikes another tube on the opposite side of the core, the reactor moves one step closer to meltdown. The reflectoid is there; that's the solid energy deflection device which bounces the particles into the posts. It's supposed be remotely controlled by a sophisticated network of computers, but tonight it has to be controlled by you!</desc>

		<name>Soko-ban</name>
		<desc>Soko-Ban is a classic puzzle game, the basis of numerous clones in the later years. It is set in a warehouse. On each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.</desc>
