		<name>Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</name>
		<desc>After the happenings of Luigi's Mansion, Luigi once again has to put on his ghostbusting gear. This time he visits Evershade Valley, where the destruction of the Dark Moon caused all ghosts to become hostile to humans. Luigi is hired by the eccentric professor Gadd to visit five haunted mansions to retrieve the Dark Moon parts.

Luigi's weapon of choice is vacuum device called PolterGust 5000 which is used to fight against the numerous ghost enemies. The basic procedure is always the same: Luigi has to stun the ghosts with the flashlight (in contrast to the predecessor, now the position and angle is important) so he can vacuum them in. Of course the ghosts struggle against it, so their movement has to be countered with the analogue stick. There are different kinds of enemies which require a variation of tactics, e.g. some ghosts have sunglasses which have to be removed first and others are only vulnerable briefly. There are also multi-stage bossfights. 

The PolterGust 5000 is also used to solve puzzles, for example by sucking in a stove and using the flames to ignite something else. It is also a good idea to use the vacuum device on physical objects in the mansions in order to find secret passages or treasure. When Luigi picks up enough treasure, the PolterGust 5000 is automatically upgraded.

Besides the campaign, there is also a multiplayer mode which takes place in the ScareScraper, mansion with 25 floors. The available modes are hunter (sucking in as many ghosts as possible in a limited amount of time), rush (finding the exit in a limited amount of time; clocks can be picked up to extend the time limit) and polterpup (tracking down polterpulps, invisible ghosts, with the flashlight).</desc>

		<name>Maple Story - Unmei No Shoujo</name>
		<desc>MapleStory: The Girlâ€™s Fate is the first title from the franchise to be released on the 3DS and represents a big step forward for the series. It sees you take control of a young girl who has a mysterious spirit trapped inside her and the only way for her to be rid of it is to head out on an adventure!

The game will retain its simplistic look and playing style, with characters drawn up as sprites and everything being controlled by a single button. In keeping with the RPG genre you'll be able to customise your character by selecting her weapon speciality and giving her a specific skill set.

Surprisingly, MapleStory: The Girlâ€™s Fate is a single player game and doesn't feature any MMO elements. It will be hitting South Korean shelves on 25th April; the series is gaining momentum in the West, so we wouldn't rule out an eventual localisation completely.</desc>

		<desc>In this enhanced remake of Pokémon Ruby Version, players travel throughout the Hoenn region on a journey to become a Pokémon Master. Like the original, the goal is to challenge the eight Pokémon Gyms of the Hoenn League and earn badges from their Gym Leaders, then take on the Elite Four and the Champion. However, the world is endangered when the villainous Team Magma tries to expand the continents by resurrecting the ancient Legendary Pokémon Groudon.

Aside from technical upgrades, the game is drastically changed in certain aspects. The Hoenn Pokédex is changed to add the evolutionary relatives of Pokémon from its original incarnation. Some Pokédex entries are also changed. Mega Evolution plays a major part of the storyline, and a new form change is introduced in the form of Primal Reversion, exclusive to Groudon and Kyogre. Some characters have had major redesigns in terms of appearance. Instead of roaming Hoenn after defeating the Champion as in the original, Latios automatically joins the player's party after summoning the player Southern Island. Latios can be used to soar through the skies of Hoenn, taking the player to locations known as Mirage Spots that cannot be reached otherwise. Pokémon Contests return under the name "Contest Spectacular" and have some new mechanics, while the basic format is largely the same.

After the main story, a new chapter called the Delta Episode is unlocked, allowing the player to once again save Hoenn from disaster. Finally, the Battle Tower is replaced by the Battle Resort, which features tough Trainers as well as a replica of the Battle Maison from Pokémon X and Y.</desc>

		<path>./Games/Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask [US] GW1.2 [3DS]/PLNMMUS.3ds</path>
		<name>PLNMMUS</name>
		<desc>Professor Layton and Luke head to the town of miracles, Montdol, in search of the Mask of Miracle. The mask has the ability to grant wishes to its wearer. Layton and Luke arrive at the town to see they are too late, as a mysterious man is using the power of the mask to turn people to stone. Layton and Luke task themselves with solving the mystery of Montdol and the Mask of Miracles.

This fifth game in the Professor Layton series makes more use of the physical button controls for puzzle-solving as opposed to just the touchscreen. To take advantage of the hardware capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS, the characters are rendered in polygons outside of cutscenes, as opposed to sprites, in addition to other polishings of the interface.

Beside the regular adventure where you traverse the town, talk to the characters and solve puzzles, there are several mini-games that get gradually unlocked as you play and find the unlockable items:

 Bunny - after a while, you will stumble upon a circus bunny that isn't performing well and decide to help it along. This will require constant training of new moves which will become available over time as you acquire them. After you teach the bunny new moves, you will be able to instruct it to use those moves during the theatrical performances. Theatrical performances consist of a director telling you what the story is about and what he wants to see in each scene, and you will have to instruct bunny to act accordingly, providing you have taught it the moves necessary to perform the full play.
 Robot - after you acquire a toy robot from one of the street vendors, you will be able to play levels that will become gradually available. Levels are rectangular in shape and you can move your robot left, right, up or down through the field of squares. Each movement uses some of the battery and you have to reach the end square before the battery depletes which still gives you a lot of time for trial and error. Single movement will move your robot by three steps unless it bumps into a wall or picks up some special items that may temporarily boost its power to eat through the wall and enemies that move in pre-defined patterns.
 Shop - helping the friend in need, as a true gentleman, this mini-game will let you order the items in the store so that when customer comes to buy what he or she wants, the rest of the items also catch his/her eye and in turn you end up selling all your wares. Base item is initially set in the store, and you can place other items only adjacent to already placed items in the store. What will catch the eye of the customer after purchasing some item is the adjacent item that is either of the same type or of the same color. Placing two similar items might confuse the customer due to ambiguity which may lead the customer to stop buying after a while if the net remaining adjacent item has no connection to the last item he or she purchased.

Beside mini-games there are many collectible items you can find during your exploration and some of the flashback sub-stories become available after certain key events which can then be watched as short episodes where characters vary from event to event, and might not even be one of the leading three characters.</desc>

		<desc>Taking place in 2005, between the events of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, the action centers on BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance) member Jill Valentine and introduces her new partner, Parker Luciani. The story is set principally on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship in the Mediterranean, where Jill and Parker have been sent to search for Chris Redfield, based on his last known GPS coordinates. Far from being empty, the ship hides danger around every corner as Jill and Parker explore the confined space of the ship and must face a menacing new horror that emerges from the darkness.
 
Adding a new unique horror setting to the series, Resident Evil: Revelations gives players the chance to venture underwater as they try to escape the terrifying creatures that are roaming the ship. But even the water does not provide safety as the creatures continue to attack from the depths while Jill and Parker make a desperate bid to make it off the ship alive.</desc>

		<name>TMNTUS</name>
		<desc>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a beat 'em up game based on the 2012 television series developed by Nickelodeon. The game takes place in New York. The four turtles Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael are ambushed by Foot Soldiers. It turns out that the Foot Soldiers created a Mutagen bomb to mutate the whole city. The turtles eventually stop this treat, but a sudden call gets them on edge again. April O'Neil has been kidnapped by Shredder and he demands Splinter. The turtles fight their way through Foot Soldiers, Kraang, Baxter Stockman and his Mousers to be able to defeat Shredder and save April.

Just like the original games it is a brawler game, but now in 3D. Many sequences use the classic side view, but there are also many other perspectives used. Each turtle has a specific attack and the four turtles are always on the screen. When not playing in co-op, the other ones are controller by the AI. During the game the turtles have to be upgraded. This can be done by collecting points by defeating enemies and breaking items. Health of any of the turtles is increased by eating pizza's, sushi and other food items. The collectibles in this game are Mutagen Canisters which are used to unlock extras.</desc>

The game couples phenomenally enhanced graphics with stunning, glasses-free 3D visuals to bring to life the daring adventures of its hero, Link. A streamlined touch-screen interface and newly implemented motion controls provide a fresh and intuitive feel as players immerse themselves in the tale of the creation of Hyrule and the struggle for control of its all-powerful ancient relic. The game will also feature new challenges not included in the original game. The Legend of Zelda veterans can look forward to the Master Quest a second quest with revamped puzzles and redesigned dungeons that feature the same graphical and interface upgrades as the main game. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is a masterful improvement on one of the landmark releases in video game history.</desc>

		<name>TLMVUS</name>
		<desc>The LEGO Movie Videogame for handheld and mobile platforms plays very similar to the console versions, except that gameplay is viewed from an isometric view instead of the third-person view. The in-game cutscenes consist of FMV sequences taken from the 2014 film of the same name (just like the other console versions).

Controls for the 3DS version include using the Circle Pad to move characters, the L and R buttons to swap characters in the levels, Y and X to attack (for short and far ranges, respectively), B to dodge and A to build several LEGO objects, as well as interacting with other characters and objects.

The 3DS version includes a total of 15 stages to complete and include timed quests (which grant the player gold bricks that add towards the completion percentage) to carry out against the clock. Emmet and Wildstyle are the main characters controlled during the story, though more characters can be unlocked later to find inaccessible collectibles in Free Play mode.</desc>

The series' fun game-play mechanics such as Yoshi's Flutter Jump, Ground Pound and Egg Throw return, but now Yoshi knows a ton of new tricks too. Yoshi gets to bash and thrash his environment by throwing around Mega Eggdozers and Metal Eggdozers. Yoshi also can transform into a variety of objects, such as a jackhammer or a submarine, both of which can be manipulated using the Nintendo 3DS gyro controls. A certain type of star even transforms him into Super Yoshi, giving him the ability to fly through the sky or run along walls and ceilings. Players who are having trouble completing a level might see the appearance of Flutter Wings, which let Yoshi fly through the air.</desc>
