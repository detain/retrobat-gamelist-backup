		<name>Astonishia Story R</name>
		<desc>Astonishia Story R is the GP32's first RPG, developed by Game Park's solitary first tier developer. The game is beautiful; *lots* of animation, detailed sprites, randomly flying birds, huge towns and an interesting cast of characters. This is PSOne quality 2D, without a doubt. It has a solid (though simple) battle system, which is like a merger of traditional and strategy RPGs.</desc>

		<desc>The third and final South Korean game based on the famous local animated series "Little Dooley Dinosaur", dedicated to the 2002 World Cup. The genre is an arcade futsal without a complete story.

There are two modes: "story" and "free". The former requires playing for the team made up of Dooley and his friends - the characters from the animated series have to beat a variety of other teams and ultimately obtain the right as representatives of Korea to play with the team of " all stars ", made up of the best players in the world.</desc>

		<desc>The game is a beat'em up in which you are at a school and the students seem to be at war with each other. You can pick between 6 different students (2 girls and 4 guys), which have different stats that don't really matter. In each level the game will have you do a certain objective, like survive for 120 seconds or kill off all the others or collect food while beating up your classmates. After each stage the 4 people in the stage (including the player) will be ranked. If you didn't make it in the top 3 then it is game over (there are no continues). There are 3 hidden characters to be unlocked, and the game is 5 stages long.
There are only three types of theme songs in this game which can make it dull. There is the introduction theme, the in-game music and then the game over music.</desc>

		<name>Her Knights - All For The Princess</name>
		<desc>Her Knights: All for the Princess is a spin-off of Geunyeo-ui Gisadan - Her Knights. Princess Lemian is forced to marry a man she does not love. As she tries to escape from the unwanted wedding, she realizes that her path is blocked by soldiers. Her faithful knights arrive to fight them and help the princess escape.

Unlike the preceding game, All for the Princess is a 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up. The player can choose to control any of the five available knights. There are too basic attacks - fast and strong. Combo attacks can be performing by combining these two with directional buttons. There are separate controls assigned to blocking ans evasive manoeuvres. The knights can also strafe backwards, while turning around is performed by pressing a separate button. Enemies usually drop health-restoring or stat-enhancing items when defeated.</desc>

The idea of students of a wizard school fighting each other is cool, and the fact that you learn additional abilities/spells as you make progress is also a good incentive to play the game through.

The cartoony, colorful and nicely drawn graphics coupled with the smooth characters animations make this game a pleasure to play.

Bottom line: Definitely one of the better fighting games on any portable console, the warm graphics and clever gameplay will make it last longer than you may expect.</desc>

He and his armies retreat. The grateful King invites you to stay and grants you an annual salary of 500 gold pieces.
Then, one night, the Swordsman hears a voice and goes out to see a girl floating in an orb of light. He is then spoken to by the girl's patron deity who asks him to raise her. How he raises her will determine if mankind has truly repented.</desc>

Game play : In the game you can be eight to ten different cell phones that all have their own unique ammo that they fire. The stages are drawn kind of goofy and of course there is wind to affect your bullets speed and etc. It is hard not because of the wind or etc but because after one or two shots the computer already knows your coordinates and will siege you to death before you even know his coordinates.</desc>

		<name>Tomak - Save The Earth, Again</name>
		<desc>Tomak: Save the Earth, Again is a horizontal scrolling shooter from Korea. The graphics are reminiscent of the artwork in the Metal Slug series, with large enemies and giant bosses at the end of the levels that take most of the screen state. As in most titles of this genre, the game is divided in stages with a unique boss enemy at the end. The player controls one of three bizarre characters: a girl inside a flowerpot called Evian, the red demon Bastylo or a wizard named Night Moon Shine.

As they fly around shooting at the oncoming foes, each successful hit increases a charge point meter at the top of the screen, below the health bar. This accumulated blue energy is used by the secondary weapons, that can be selected at any time to switch to more effective and powerful shots. Up to two players can cooperate in Arcade Mode, or compete for points in the Versus Mode.</desc>

		<name>Tomak - Save The Earth, Again</name>
		<desc>Tomak: Save the Earth, Again is a horizontal scrolling shooter from Korea. The graphics are reminiscent of the artwork in the Metal Slug series, with large enemies and giant bosses at the end of the levels that take most of the screen state. As in most titles of this genre, the game is divided in stages with a unique boss enemy at the end. The player controls one of three bizarre characters: a girl inside a flowerpot called Evian, the red demon Bastylo or a wizard named Night Moon Shine.

As they fly around shooting at the oncoming foes, each successful hit increases a charge point meter at the top of the screen, below the health bar. This accumulated blue energy is used by the secondary weapons, that can be selected at any time to switch to more effective and powerful shots. Up to two players can cooperate in Arcade Mode, or compete for points in the Versus Mode.</desc>

		<name>Wizard Slayer</name>
		<desc>Review - Wizard Slayer is a nice side scrolling shooter with excellent graphics all around reminiscent of Cotton.

Levels are very colorful, the scrolling is smooth and the parallax layers are a definite plus. On the bad side, some levels seem to go by uneventfully, as they stretch for what seems to be a long time. Also, the enemies you will face are very detailed and well animated but they should have been more varied.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Woody &amp; Kunta - Treasure Island (Europe).smc</path>
		<name>Treasure Island</name>
		<desc>The main objective of the game is to drop bombs though the correct holes to bomb your opponent. Now this may sound easy however it is not. The tubes that you drop your bombs in will correspond to only one tube on your opponent's side. During boss fights every few turns the tubes will change order and there will be many more tubes (8 instead of the normal 6). In the game, you will also be able to get items to aid you in battle by either tossing a bomb through a tube that leads to a target or by just random npcs on the island that you meet. After you win a battle your icon on the island's map will move X amount of spaces. Depending on how many turns it took to defeat your opponent, you will get to move X amount of spaces on the island, with 3 as the maximum. The point of moving is to get to the end of the island to challenge the boss at the end it to get to the next portion of the island.

The game  consists of 4 maps.</desc>
