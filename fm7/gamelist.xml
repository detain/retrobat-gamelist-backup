The classic Japanese puzzle game that has been ported many times to various systems and is sometimes better known as a Boxxle in the West due to that being its name on the Nintendo Game Boy. The gameplay is simple, you must control a character and push boxes onto the dots on each map to complete the level. If you make the slightest mistake though it usually means you have to begin the stage again. A devilishly challenging puzzle game that is sure to test your wits.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, the player takes the role of Adol (Aron in the English-language Sega Master System version) Christin, a red-haired adventurer and expert swordsman. One day he encounter a fortune teller who sends him on a quest to find information about the six books of Ys. It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books. Before long Adol learns that the six books were all stolen by the evil wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in the Sega Master System version, Malificus in the English-language computer versions). It is Adol's task to defeat the villain and discover the secret of Ys! Ys: Ancient Ys Vanished Omen is an action role-playing game with its own trademark combat system: instead of pressing the "attack" button, the protagonist simply runs into the enemies he encounters. More damage is inflicted upon the enemies if Adol charges at them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in the hero's death if the monster is stronger than him. The player gains gold and experience points for defeating foes; once enough experience has been accumulated, Adol levels up and becomes stronger. The hero can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.</desc>

		<name>Wingman 2: Kitakura no Fukkatsu</name>
		<desc>Wingman 2 is an Adventure game, developed and published by Enix Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1986 The aim of the game is to find the killers sent from Podrimus dimension and neutralize them. The clues are to be found in the eight locations of the school. Original story. This time it's more fun since we're accompanied by Aoi or Miki who do all the feedback. It's a pretty cool system that it's enough to write the proper verb and just click on the object - that's almost point-and-click here! There are three chapters with first two moving between the same eight places and the third final one without any moving. In the prequel the fights were happening on a narrow black line with two small characters - this time there is a full battle screen and animation is much better. The scene of transformation to wingman was especially impressive since it has "Ching!" real voice cry coming out and there have not been voiced games yet. There seems to be only two battles in the game though compared to four in the original. So with only 8 locations and two battles the game is really short and a perfect run can be done in 10 minutes if you know the exploration part already.</desc>

		<name>Chikyuu Senshi Rayieza</name>
		<desc>In the year 2300, mankind has finally united, creating a federation government on the Earth and dedicating efforts and resources to space travel. Humans have spread to distant planets, only to face the gravest danger of all: a mysterious alien race that utilizes the newest robotic technology to destroy humanity. The special team Rayieza was stationed on Mars; after an alien assault, only one member, Blue, has survived. The protagonist's orders are to team up with Blue and safely return to Earth, which sounds much easier than it is in reality... One of Enix's early RPGs, Chikyū Senshi Rayieza has several distinguishing features. Unlike most RPGs, where the heroes explore the world on foot, in this game the player is mostly confined to the space ship; movement between planets is performed by selecting the appropriate menu command. Each flight between planets takes time; enemies would pop out randomly and attack the crew.</desc>

		<name>Wingman 2: Kitakura no Fukkatsu</name>
		<desc>Wingman 2 is an Adventure game, developed and published by Enix Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1986 The aim of the game is to find the killers sent from Podrimus dimension and neutralize them. The clues are to be found in the eight locations of the school. Original story. This time it's more fun since we're accompanied by Aoi or Miki who do all the feedback. It's a pretty cool system that it's enough to write the proper verb and just click on the object - that's almost point-and-click here! There are three chapters with first two moving between the same eight places and the third final one without any moving. In the prequel the fights were happening on a narrow black line with two small characters - this time there is a full battle screen and animation is much better. The scene of transformation to wingman was especially impressive since it has "Ching!" real voice cry coming out and there have not been voiced games yet. There seems to be only two battles in the game though compared to four in the original. So with only 8 locations and two battles the game is really short and a perfect run can be done in 10 minutes if you know the exploration part already.</desc>

Both the text messages displayed and the text input are in katakana (Japanese syllabic writing system). Several special commands can be accessed by pressing shortcut keys (Latin letters on the keyboard).

		<name>Archon: The Light and the Dark</name>
		<desc>Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side.

However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Sector/Argo (Japan) (FM77AV) (Disk 1).d77</path>
		<name>Argo</name>
		<desc>Loosely based on the Greek myth of the Argonauts, Argo focuses on its central protagonist Iason (Jason), narrating a simple story that does not quite correspond to the known myth: Iason's father has been poisoned, and his native city Iolkos overrun by monsters known as Pontos. Iason must single-handedly eliminate them and save his homeland.

Argo is a role-playing game set in a pseudo-3D continuous world. The player explores the environments from a first-person view. It is possible to try to talk to any encountered character, as well as attack anyone. Most battles take place within the exploration area and involve a fairly simple turn-based exchange of attacks. However, occasional fights against larger monsters take place on a separate screen, have an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective, and require the player to move and attack in real time. Experience points and gold are awarded for defeating enemies. It is necessary to feed the protagonist; when his condition is "hungry" food also restores a portion of his hit points.</desc>

		<name>Arion</name>
		<desc>Game follows the story of anime with the same title. In Thrace, Arion is taken from his mother Demeter by the god Hades. In the Underworld, Arion is trained to be a warrior. His training is driven by revenge: Arion was told that his mother's blindness was caused by Zeus and Zeus' death will remove the curse. Finally, Arion and Geedo (a huge ape-like creature who had become Arion's friend and companion) left the Underworld to find Zeus. Seneca, a small thief, makes off with Arion's sword and this leads Arion to his first encounter with the forces of Zeus, commanded by his daughter Athena. Arion is captured but is later set free by Lesfeena, Athena's mute serving girl. As Arion rejoins Geedo and Seneca (and worries about Lesfeena), the forces of Zeus and Poseidon face each other in battle. In the background sits the scheming Hades, and the calm Apollon who seems to have plans of his own.</desc>

		<desc>Game follows the story of anime with the same title. In Thrace, Arion is taken from his mother Demeter by the god Hades. In the Underworld, Arion is trained to be a warrior. His training is driven by revenge: Arion was told that his mother's blindness was caused by Zeus and Zeus' death will remove the curse. Finally, Arion and Geedo (a huge ape-like creature who had become Arion's friend and companion) left the Underworld to find Zeus. Seneca, a small thief, makes off with Arion's sword and this leads Arion to his first encounter with the forces of Zeus, commanded by his daughter Athena. Arion is captured but is later set free by Lesfeena, Athena's mute serving girl. As Arion rejoins Geedo and Seneca (and worries about Lesfeena), the forces of Zeus and Poseidon face each other in battle. In the background sits the scheming Hades, and the calm Apollon who seems to have plans of his own.</desc>

		<name>Daisenryaku</name>
		<desc>Daisenryaku is the second game in the turn-based war strategy series. The core mechanics are similar to those of Gendai Daisenryaku: there are two belligerents in every scenario, "blue" and "red" (though they can be renamed by the player). The game includes a dozen maps with varied types of locations and terrains (islands, deserts, mountains, etc.). Many of these maps based on real-world locations (e.g. Europe, China and Korea, etc.), though without any specific dates or pre-history given, and always with contemporary weapons and vehicles. A map editor is also included.
Like in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Production costs money, and fuel has to be delivered to the units regularly with supply trucks. Participants then navigate their units on a hex-based grid, trying to occupy cities and airports on the way for strategic advantage.</desc>

		<name>Dezeni Land</name>
		<desc>Dezeni Land is a text adventure with graphics. The game's nameless protagonist must visit six attractions parodying well-known areas of Tokyo Disneyland of the early 1980's, find the treasures within and escape. The title itself is a pun involving Disney and a Japanese expression referring showing off one's wealth. The gameplay largely follows the standards of interactive fiction, including simple verb-noun combinations as well as directions (forward, back, left, and right) for navigation. The areas are accessed in a linear fashion; items needed to advance to the next attraction can only be founded in an earlier explored location.</desc>

		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Dragon Buster is an action platform game composed out of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. The player's goal in every level is to reach the final stage where the protagonist faces the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, the player character moves through platform stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since it is impossible to heal between the stages. The hero's life meter (called "vitality" in the game) is the first introduction of such a feature to action games.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Sector/Final Lolita (Japan) (Alt).d77</path>
		<name>Final Lolita: Darkside of Software</name>
		<desc>Final Lolita has little to do with PSK's previous similarly-named titles gameplay-wise; however, it shares with them the macabre premise of sex with underage girls, and is the most explicit and violent of the three. The game's genre is closest to RPG format, since it focuses on a character's attributes and allows the player to increase them. These attributes are Power, Arm Level, Defence, and Technique, each playing a role in upcoming battles. The player can choose to distribute a hundred points among these parameters in the beginning of the game. Navigation takes place on a top-down map, the player character represented as a simple square. Many spots on the map contain various objects, which will increase or decrease the protagonist's attributes. The goal is to power up the character sufficiently for combat. Battles occur when the player navigates the main character to a spot occupied by a girl and chooses to attack her.</desc>

		<desc>The premise of Flicky is dramatically simple: the chick has to face a succession of fixed boards (which form an infinite loop around themselves) full of platforms. The other inhabitants of the board are a variable number of tiny chicks, a kitten called Tiger and an iguana called Iggy. The objective is of course to collect all the chicks and get them to the exit while avoiding Tiger and Iggy. Once taken under your wing, the chicks will follow you in single file. If Tiger or Iggy manage to hit one of the chicks, it will stop following you and you will have to retrieve it. If the two predators catch Flicky, they eat him, simple as that. The only way Flicky can get rid of his feline and reptilian pursuers is by picking up certain items lying around the levels and sending them into Tiger's vibrissae or Iggy's scales.</desc>

		<desc>The protagonist of the game is an eighteen-year-old boy whose destiny is to defeat a legendary demon, thus ending the Age of Darkness. As the hero embarks on his journey, he realizes that he must have chosen a wrong destination, for he becomes stranded on a tropical island that seems to be populated entirely by women. No, the hero does not abandon his world-saving mission because of that; but in order to leave the island, he needs to perform various quests for its young and pretty female inhabitants, which more often than not involve demonstrating... err... somewhat intimate aspects of his heroic nature. Girls Paradise is an adventure game without real puzzles and with menu-based interface; however, it differs from most typical Japanese adventures by allowing (and requiring) the player to find and pick up certain items and then use them from the inventory to advance in the game.</desc>

		<name>Hokuto No Ken</name>
		<desc>Hokuto no Ken is based on the manga series Fist of the North Star. The story focuses on Kenshiro, a young martial artist proficient in the deadly technique known as Hokuto Shinken, which he uses to protect innocents against malevolent fighters populating a post-apocalyptic world. The game's plot follows the initial story arc of the manga, as Kenshiro and Bat are trying to locate Kenshiro's old rival Shin. This incarnation of the series is a Japanese-style adventure, with still screens representing locations and menu-based interaction with the environment. The verb menu is the same for all screens, comprising eleven commands. The player advances the story by exploring locations and trying out all the commands, combining some of them with objects. The game also includes a few fight sequences, during which the player has to aim a specific body part and charge a punch to inflict damage to the enemy.</desc>

		<desc>It is the year 2061, and Halley's Comet is coming towards Earth. A crew has been gathered from eight different countries to man a pair of space probes sent to investigate the comet. The two probes, Comet and Corona, are to launch from Space Lab Jesus and collect a sample of the gases in the tail of the comet, and determine if life on Earth was brought by this comet as some have speculated. However, communication has been lost with the probe Comet; what could be going on? Jesus is a Japanese-style adventure game. Each area is shown with an image, and you have the option of several commands. The player takes the role of Japanese pilot Hayao Musou, a member of the crew, and attempts to solve the mystery surrounding Comet and Halley's Comet.</desc>

		<desc>Kohakuiro no Yuigon ("Amber Testament") is the first in the row of detective games starring the fictional Japanese private investigator Ryūnosuke Tōdō. The events of the game take places in Japan in the year 1921, and Tōdō must investigate a mysterious murder of a rich man in his own mansion. The deceased had many relatives, and its the detective's job to find out which one of them (if any) has committed the murder. The game plays mostly like an adventure with light simulation elements. The interaction is done with menu commands, focusing on conversation topics. The protagonist has to talk to the mansion's inhabitants about other people and hear their opinion concerning the crime, unlocking new topics as he gathers information. Rooms can and should be searched for clues as well. In his own room the detective can view dossiers and evidence.</desc>

		<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes. The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision. This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

		<desc>People inhabiting a world called Felix communicate with gods to divine their future. The king of the Forest Country is looking for a husband for his daughter and organizes a tournament for noble young men from different countries. The prince from the Lake Country is victorious, but an evil magician turns him into a strange-looking creature and banishes him to faraway lands. The prince has to travel back and find a way to remove the curse. Märchen Veil I is an overhead action game with light role-playing elements. The game consists of maze-like stages heavily populated by enemies. The prince has to fight his way through by using ranged magic, which effectively turns the game into a shooter. The magic attack can have different properties depending on the special items picked up by the prince. Throughout the game the player will also find items that restore or permanently increase the protagonist's health. Still-screen scenes (called "visual stages") advance the story between levels.</desc>

		<name>Might and Magic: Book One - Secret Of The Inner Sanctum</name>
		<desc>Might and Magic: Book One is the first dungeon-crawling role-playing video game in the long-running series. The plot focuses on six adventurers in a quest to discover the secret of the "Inner Sanctum," though little information is offered upfront about this quest or its object. The ultimate quest is kept intentionally vague, and left for players to gradually piece together as they explore the world. Although the game appears to take place in a straightforward medieval fantasy setting of knights in armor, mythical monsters and magicians, a number of science fiction elements are revealed later in the game.</desc>

		<desc>You play the part of Bounty Bob, and it is your mission to explore every inch of an abandoned mine. As you walk over floor sections in the mine, the floor will change color. When all of the floor sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there. You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a cannon). Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bob's way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed. There is a total of ten different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as to figure out a unique strategy for each level.</desc>

		<name>Mugen No Shinzou II</name>
		<desc>After the protagonist of the previous game retrieved the precious Heart of Phantasm, he was teleported away from the magical world he had been stranded in - but not to his home, as he hoped, but to another fantasy realm, Elderein. This land suffers under the yoke of the evil Prince of Darkness, and it's up to the hero to deal with him and find a way to leave this world. Mugen no Shinzō II is a role-playing game very similar visually and gameplay-wise to early Ultima games. As opposed to the first game, overworld occupies the majority of the screen, and towns can be physically explored in a top-down fashion. Another change is elimination of random enemy encounters in favor of enemies visibly roaming the overworld. Characters can now join the protagonist and participate in battles. Battles are viewed from first-person perspective (with large enemy portraits) and feature simple turn-based mechanics.</desc>

		<name>Nobunaga no Yabou: Zenkoku-ban</name>
		<desc>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</desc>

		<desc>In 21th century, there are three main powers on the Earth. The free world and the communist block carried over from the 20th century; the third power is the New Communist Federation. Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite "Raiden". The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship "Septemius 1" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, "Racoon", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. You are Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship "Septemius 2" that was sent to investigate the strange disappearance.</desc>

		<desc>In 21th century, there are three main powers on the Earth. The free world and the communist block carried over from the 20th century; the third power is the New Communist Federation. Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite "Raiden". The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship "Septemius 1" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, "Racoon", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. You are Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship "Septemius 2" that was sent to investigate the strange disappearance.</desc>

The Quest was one of the first graphic adventures that incorporated full sentence parsing. Unlike most other adventures, the commands the player inputs do not refer to the playable character.

The spirit appears at underwater ruins with no explanation why it became a spirit and what it needs to do. In fact, one will only find out about the story of the game when seeing the real ending. The graphic style of the game is compared to the works of H. R. Giger. Players can possess other bodies after killing their owners, but to get the real ending, they must explore the ruins while avoiding unnecessary combat by running away or ignoring the characters they meet on their way. There is no music in the game apart from the opening and the real ending and, depending on the body possessed, players will acquire different skills and attacks.</desc>

The sub-title, The Real-Time Adventure, is a reference to the game's real-time, persistent, open world, where time continues to elapse, day-night cycles adjust the brightness of the screen to indicate the time of day, and certain stores and non-player characters would only be available at certain times of the day. The game also gives players direct control over the player character. The game also features a fantasy story, full-colour 2D overhead scrolling graphics, and RPG elements. It won the 1987 Game of the Year award from Japanese gaming magazine Oh!X.</desc>

The game is set in a vast seamless world that consists of interconnected yet varied urban, wilderness, and dungeon-like locations. The principal view is third-person with a side-scrolling flavor, similar to Western adventure games of the time. The player is free to explore most of the locations from the onset. The game world is populated by many different types of friendly and hostile characters. Killing hostile characters increases the player's score and eventually makes the main character stronger. Killing friendly NPCs, on the other hand, may lower the score. Combat system is simple and involves approaching a character and pressing the attack button, which results in the protagonist swinging the sword.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2028. It is said that an eccentric genius scientist has constructed a laboratory on an island known as Ero-Manga. This island is populated by robots and beautiful girls. An exploration team consisting of an intrepid adventurer and his female assistant, who is looking for her missing father, lands on the island and is prepared to explore the wilderness in search of the laboratory. Skapon Taikentai is a humorous erotic adventure game. The player moves from locations represented as still anime-style screens with the arrow keys. Eight verb commands (such as "Examine", "Take", "Talk", etc.) are available at all times in a menu to the right. In the wilderness areas there is a considerable degree of exploration, as the player is free to visit any locations from the onset. There are no real puzzles, but sometimes certain items have to be acquired and used in appropriate locations in order to advance.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2028. It is said that an eccentric genius scientist has constructed a laboratory on an island known as Ero-Manga. This island is populated by robots and beautiful girls. An exploration team consisting of an intrepid adventurer and his female assistant, who is looking for her missing father, lands on the island and is prepared to explore the wilderness in search of the laboratory. Skapon Taikentai is a humorous erotic adventure game. The player moves from locations represented as still anime-style screens with the arrow keys. Eight verb commands (such as "Examine", "Take", "Talk", etc.) are available at all times in a menu to the right. In the wilderness areas there is a considerable degree of exploration, as the player is free to visit any locations from the onset. There are no real puzzles, but sometimes certain items have to be acquired and used in appropriate locations in order to advance.</desc>

		<name>Space Harrier</name>
		<desc>Run… fly… dodge those obstacles, but return fire on wave after wave of attacking aliens. Armed with a really big gun, you have to defend yourself against the alien hordes using your wits to navigate around the screen. But watch out for those end of level bosses! Originating in the arcades, Space Harrier is a third-person rail shooter with pseudo-3D graphics, set in the same world as Fantasy Zone. The lone titular hero fights aliens with a fireball-launching cannon, which can also be used to transform the hero into a flying rocket. The protagonist is constantly in motion, but the speed of his movement can be regulated by the player.</desc>

		<name>Taiyou no Shinden : Asteka II</name>
		<desc>The story of Taiyō no Shinden: Asteka II is dedicated to the Maya people, indigenous inhabitants of Southern Mexico and Central America, rather than the Aztecs. The player controls a nameless adventurer who searches for the Sun Key, a mysterious ancient artifact which can unlock the secrets of the Mayan civilization. Asteka II is an adventure game which takes place in the ruins of the ancient city Chichen Itza on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. There is a top-down overworld on which the player can physically navigate the protagonist, entering temples and other locations. In such locations, the view switches to first-person perspective. The player interacts with the environment by selecting various verb commands, represented by icons, from a menu, and combining them with objects on the screen. In spite of its Japanese origins, the game features inventory item usage and puzzle-solving, which are more typical of Western-style adventures.</desc>

		<desc>Everything was peaceful on the island of Rwanda, until the evil demon lord Pay Valusa invaded it, sending hordes of monsters to do his bidding. A lone warrior named Tritorn is the only one who can defeat the demon and restore peace. Triton is, together with Dragon Slayer and Hydlide, an early progenitor of the action role-playing genre. Similarly to Xanadu, exploration is performed from a side view, with jumping and vertical areas, but no true platforming. Unlike the aforementioned games, it is necessary to press the action key to hit enemies rather than simply "bumping" into them. The gameplay system is very simple, having no weapon or equipment management, monetary system, or friendly areas. The protagonist either attacks enemies with his sword or throws magic balls at them, which come in limited supply. Experience points are awarded for slaying enemies; though there is no clear indicator as to when the player character levels up, he gradually becomes stronger, tougher, and learns new abilities (e.g. walking faster).</desc>

		<name>Ultima II : The Revenge Of The Enchantress</name>
		<desc>The sequel to Ultima featured several improvements over the original, such as larger town maps, and the concept of traveling through time gates into different eras on Earth. Other than that the gameplay is pretty much the same as in Ultima I, with your single character roaming the land fighting monsters and looking for key items. In the original Ultima a hero from a certain third rate blue planet orbiting an insignificant yellow sun came to the world of Sosaria and slew the evil wizard Mondain before he could fulfill his dreams of universal domination. Thus peace was brought to Sosaria, and the hero hailed as a champion of the people of all time. Unfortunately, Mondain happened to have a young apprentice/lover named Minax who is understandably upset over his death. Using her considerable powers, Minax travels through time and space to the hero's homeworld of Earth and instigates a nuclear war, thus serving the dual purpose of working out her frustration as well as erasing the hero from history. Of course, as the hero, this works out rather badly for you, and so with the help of Lord British you must travel through time and somehow find Minax and prevent the events which culminate in the destruction of Earth.</desc>

		<desc>Ulysses is an adventure game where you play the part of Ulysses in ancient Greece. The king has given you the task of finding the golden fleece, a legendary treasure which is protected by the gods. You begin your quest in a small town, and will need to travel to several far away lands to find the fleece. Many characters from ancient mythology will be encountered along the way, including King Neptune, the Sirens, Cyclops, and others. You need to find a way past them as well as the many obstacles on sea and land if you are to be successful. Along the bottom of the screen is a text parser which accepts two word commands to interact with the game, and at the top (covering most of the screen) are graphics depicting your current situation. If needed, the graphics can temporarily be cleared to see some of the most recent commands entered.</desc>

		<name>Wibarm</name>
		<desc>Wibarm is an action game with RPG elements, and several gameplay modes. The player controls a robot who can also transform into a tank or a flying spacecraft; each form has its own strengths and weaknesses. Similarly to Thexder, the player guides the transformable robot through side-scrolling levels, shooting at enemies and trying to stay alive. However, when the robot enters a building, the game transforms into one of the earlier examples of a 3D, third-person perspective shooter. The levels culminate in boss battles, which take place on separate top-down areas. The player is given a considerable freedom as to which locations to visit first. Collecting power units increases the robot's power. If a particular boss encounter proves to be too difficult, the player can explore other areas, level up, and return to the boss stronger than before, giving the game an RPG angle.</desc>

		<name>Wingman 2: Kitakura no Fukkatsu</name>
		<desc>Wingman 2 is an Adventure game, developed and published by Enix Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1986 The aim of the game is to find the killers sent from Podrimus dimension and neutralize them. The clues are to be found in the eight locations of the school. Original story. This time it's more fun since we're accompanied by Aoi or Miki who do all the feedback. It's a pretty cool system that it's enough to write the proper verb and just click on the object - that's almost point-and-click here! There are three chapters with first two moving between the same eight places and the third final one without any moving. In the prequel the fights were happening on a narrow black line with two small characters - this time there is a full battle screen and animation is much better. The scene of transformation to wingman was especially impressive since it has "Ching!" real voice cry coming out and there have not been voiced games yet. There seems to be only two battles in the game though compared to four in the original. So with only 8 locations and two battles the game is really short and a perfect run can be done in 10 minutes if you know the exploration part already.</desc>

		<name>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</name>
		<desc>The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process. The first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. The player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.</desc>

		<name>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</name>
		<desc>The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process. The first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. The player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.</desc>

		<desc>Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds is the sequel to Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. It is an early example of an expansion pack, requiring the player to have the original Wizardry installed to play. It uses the same engine and spells, but is scaled for importing existing characters rather than creating a new party. Players explore a 3D wire frame maze searching for a key item, the Staff of Gnilda, required to complete the game. The player creates a party of up to 6 characters of various classes, and then gain experience points by fighting random encounters. The maze has many hidden doors and secrets, so the player is encouraged to map out each floor on graph paper to find their way.</desc>

		<name>Wizardry: Legacy of Llylgamyn</name>
		<desc>A generation has passed since your band of adventurers reclaimed the Staff of Gnilda and the armor of the Knight of Diamonds, and the land has been at peace. But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb. Legacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game. Character classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.</desc>

Instead of playing as a party of six player-generated characters, the player controls Werdna himself, the evil Archmage from the first game. It seems that after Werdna was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, he was imprisoned at the bottom of his ten-level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he is out for revenge.</desc>

		<name>Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II</name>
		<desc>Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China. The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins. Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only.</desc>

		<name>Xanadu Scenario II: The Resurrection of Dragon</name>
		<desc>Xanadu: Scenario 2 is an expansion pack to Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II. Just like the original game, it is not particularly story-driven; once again, the player is thrown into the medieval fantasy world as a lone nameless hero, who must explore the maze-like environments and stay alive in the process.</desc>

		<name>Xevious</name>
		<desc>A hundred thousand years ago, an ancient civilization prospered on our Earth, their product being GAMP (General Artificial Matrix Producer). In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.</desc>
