		<name>10-Yard Fight</name>
		<desc>10-Yard Fight is a simple arcade game based on American football. One player can play against the computer or a second player head-to-head matchup and can choose between five levels of difficulty (high school, college, pro, playoffs, and Super Bowl). If you win a game at a lower difficulty level, the following game is automatically played at the next highest difficulty level.

Gameplay is top-down and vertical-scrolling. There are no plays or formations to select from before the action begins; the player can take the snap as quarterback or choose one of two players on defense. On offense, the player can either keep the ball on the run, toss it to one of the two running backs, or throw long to the receiver; an interception turns the ball over to the other team. If a touchdown can't be scored, then the directional kicking system can be used to punt the ball or try for a field goal. One game consists (accelerated real-time) 30-minute halves of play to decide who wins this 10-Yard Fight.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to 1942, which is still a vertically scrolling shooter, has the player once again fighting over the clouds during the second world war, this time in an intense battle just off the coast of Midway islands.

Updates to the gameplay include an energy bar, which can be run down by either being hit from incoming fire or using a special weapon. The energy bar can be replenished by picking up power-ups, while special weapons (lightning, cyclones and waves) can knock down all fighters on the screen at the time.</desc>

		<desc>Somewhere in a place known as Solar System #517, the evil Grax and his horde of Serpentbeasts are terrorizing the people of the eight worlds. A hero is needed who can run and jump. Jump between worlds, in fact. That hero is the WorldRunner.

3-D WorldRunner is a 3rd person game, behind the player, moving "forwards" towards the screen and away from you. Your only skill is the ability to jump. Jump over holes, enemies and on top of columns. Bonus items are found in the air, on top of columns and laying on the ground. Additionally the game is viewable in 3-D with a pair of 3-D glasses (included in the original box).</desc>

		<desc>You're a skateboarder in Skate City, one of the largest skateparks ever built. Ollie off of ramps, grind on rails, and swerve past pedestrians as you bust out tricks. Visit skate shops scattered around the park to upgrade your gear and improve your skills. Participate in competitions to earn medals and cash to use in the shops. But, if you don't get to a competition in time, the infamous "Skate Or Die" message appears, and then you have to hurry!</desc>

		<desc>8 Eyes chronicles the adventures of Orin, the falconer, who must visit 8 different houses in 8 different lands and defeat 8 different guardians in order to collect 8 different jewels called eyes. It is a side-scrolling action/adventure game where the lead character can attack with a sword of somewhat limited reach. However, that is not the most powerful tool at his disposal - Orin also has his trusty falcon that he can send around the room to attack enemies or trigger remote switches. In single-player mode, the player controls both the falconer and the falcon. However, the game also offers a cooperative mode where the first player controls Orin and the second player controls his falcon in a mode which offers greater flight capability.</desc>

		<name>Abadox : The Deadly Inner War</name>
		<desc>Somewhere in the galaxy, a huge alien space creature known as Parasitis travels between realms digesting it's pray. It's latest victim is the planet Abadox which is now consumed by the alien entity. However, in order to digest this planet, Parasitis has had to assume to form of the planet itself. Abadox's starfleet, the World Alive Force (WAF) uses this time to launch an all out assault on the alien lifeform, of which you are a single soldier.

Abadox is a side-scrolling shooter. You must fire upon various enemies that travel across the screen and destroy their bosses as well. One button controls your shooting and another controls your shield ability.</desc>

		<name>The Addams Family</name>
		<desc>The Addams Family is a side-scrolling platformer based on the movie of the same name. The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the woods, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. Some of them can be dispatched of by a jump on their heads. 

The main difference to the other versions of this game is a unique level design. There is also a life meter which allows to get hit more often before dying.</desc>

		<name>The Addams Family : Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt</name>
		<desc>The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a side-scrolling platformer based on the second animated TV series The Addams Family (1992). The entire Addams family is being held captive by various monsters throughout the mansion, and Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies.

This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of The Addams Family - it features the same storyline with another main character and almost identical level design. Another difference to the SNES version of this game is that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.</desc>

		<name>Fester's Quest</name>
		<desc>Uncle Fester was out one night, moonbathing in the yard of the Addams Family property one day when suddenly, out of the sky, a UFO descended and started beaming alien creatures to the planet. Grabbing his gun, Fester sets off to stop the aliens and slay their boss creatures, encountering other Addams Family members along the way who will aid him.

Fester's Quest is an overhead-view game in which Uncle Fester uses his gun, or later, a whip to attack enemies near him. Enemies drop money and power-ups. The money can be used at Hot Dog stands to replenish health. A variety of items can be collected, each with a different effect. Fester and the rest of the Addams family are based on their characters from the popular 1960s TV show (this game was made before the remakes in  both series and movie form).</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : DragonStrike</name>
		<desc>Unlike its namesake on computers, this version of DragonStrike is a straight action game with a top-down perspective. Set during the War of the Lance in the Dragonlance world of Krynn, the player controls dragons in missions against the forces of evil.

At the start of the game, one of three dragons can be selected (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different attributes in speed and armor and two different breath attacks. In each of the more than 12 missions, several objectives must be completed: enemy dragons must be hunted down, ships sunk and fortresses destroyed. The dragon can change between low and high altitudes to avoid obstacles and enemy fire and to attack certain types of enemies: ground troops can only be destroyed from the lower altitude, dragons only from the higher one. Killed enemy dragons leave power-ups that grant temporary protection, speed, or let the dragon regain health. Some of the missions include boss battles against large enemies like a giant kraken or a powerful dark wizard.

In two-player mode, the second player (who can select a different dragon) can continue in the mission where the previous player failed.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : Hillsfar</name>
		<desc>Play a would-be hero in the city of Hillsfar, where action and adventure await the daring adventurer. Join the local guild and complete missions from the guild master in a quest for glory and gold!

Hillsfar is a "single-hero" role playing game (in comparison to other Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPGs, where the player usually controls a group of characters). A combination of 1st person perspective (when traveling in the city of Hillsfar) and 3rd person perspective (usually in some action-style mini-quests) viewpoints.

As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated mission-based plot: Thief, Mage, Fighter or Cleric. Each class, to a certain extent, has a different approach for completing quests.

In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various "mini-games" that are needed to complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : Pool of Radiance</name>
		<desc>Located on the northern shore of the Moonsea in Forgotten Realms, Phlan was once a flourishing trade city. However, lately monsters began settling in it, gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan and accepts the quest.

Pool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.

Exploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest. Non-human characters can also "multi-class" (learn the abilities of another class) when leveling up.

The NES version was substantially different from other versions. It removed references to the Adventure's Journal and some of the more complex features of the computer versions, like different currency units. Battles were significantly reduced in size, the graphics were overhauled and redesigned so that the game could be controlled with a control pad, and music was written for it. A randomly generated dungeon feature was also removed.</desc>

		<desc>In the South Pacific, Master Higgins lives peacefully wearing only a grass skirt and a cap. That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

		<name>Adventure Island II</name>
		<desc>In Adventure Island II: Aliens in Paradise the player takes the role of Master Higgins who has to save his cavegirl from aliens which also want to dominate the Earth. The basic gameplay elements are the same as in its predecessor Adventure Island: Master Higgins walks through the levels while fighting against various enemies. One hit results in his untimely death unless he carries one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero.

A big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don't have to be used instantly but can be saved for later: before every level the player can choose the power ups he wants to bring with him. There are overall eight worlds with different themes which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes there are different paths with other level and at the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a boss.</desc>

		<desc>In Adventure Island II: Aliens in Paradise the player takes the role of Master Higgins who has to save his cavegirl from aliens which also want to dominate the Earth. The basic gameplay elements are the same as in its predecessor Adventure Island: Master Higgins walks through the levels while fighting against various enemies. One hit results in his untimely death unless he carries one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero.

A big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don't have to be used instantly but can be saved for later: before every level the player can choose the power ups he wants to bring with him. There are overall eight worlds with different themes which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes there are different paths with other level and at the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a boss.</desc>

Bayou Billy is an arcade action game with three different types of gameplay: fighting, shooting, and driving.

The shooting section can be played with either the Nintendo Light Zapper or the controller. You have a limited amount of ammo to get through the level, and if you run out you lose a life. In the driving section your jeep is armed with machine guns and grenades to help get past the many enemy vehicles on the way to your destination. There is a total of nine levels, or you can play in the practice mode which lets you choose to play a fighting, shooting, or driving round individually.</desc>

		<name>The Adventures of Gilligan's Island</name>
		<desc>The plot is based on a TV sitcom of the 60's named Gilligan's Island.  Your ship crashed on a deserted island, and now you must get back to civilization.  The stranded people on the island are: Gilligan and the Skipper ( the crew of the ship), a millionaire and his wife, a professor, and Mariann who is a homely Midwest U.S.A. girl.

Despite the name, you'll be playing as the Skipper. Gilligan follows you around as a comedic relief sidekick. The game is divided into four episodes; the goal is always to locate all crew members in a limited amount of time. To do so the two heroes have to navigate the maze-like island and collect items - every found character provides hints for the next step.

There are also a lot of dangers which have to be faced: wild animals and headhunters can be fought with your bare hands and fallen rocks or obstacles on the ground have to be avoided. A common nuisance are holes in the ground which lead to the underground caves: Gilligan is likely to fall into these. If this happens Skipper has two minutes to get Gilligan back. There are three items which help Skipper on his quest: bananas replenish his health, hourglasses give extra time and the rope is used to get Gilligan back instantly.</desc>

Most were powerless against the ravages of these minions of darkness. It was a time of locked doors and darkened windows, when people hid in their beds and prayed for an end to the night. In spite of these tales of dread, warriors, adventurers and treasure-hunters would still find their way to the caves to seek fortune and glory.

		<desc>The lovely princess Lala was kidnapped by the Evil Demons of the Empire. You are Lolo, a round ball-like creature (just like the princess herself), and your mission is to sneak into the empire castle and to liberate the princess.

Adventures of Lolo is a puzzle game, and each level is a castle room. The goal in each room is to collect all the hearts. It is not always easy, because some hearts are blocked by enemies who will shoot you when you cross their path horizontally or vertically (or both). Once you collect all the hearts, a treasure chest will open and activate all the creatures in the room, even those who were not hostile until now. You must quickly cross the room to the exit which is now available to go to the next room. The game contains 50 rooms in total.

The difficulty level increases with each room, and after a few levels there is an especially hard room with tougher enemies.</desc>

		<name>Adventures of Lolo 3</name>
		<desc>This time, Lolo has a red friend who will do for him some of the work. Unlike the two previous Lolo games, here you can wander around a world map and enter different locations in a non-linear fashion. However, some of the locations remain blocked until you find a key after completing another level. 

The gameplay is very similar to the one of the two previous games. You have to collect all the hearts in each room. Enemies will prevent you from doing that, and others will appear once you have eaten all the hearts and are hurrying towards the exit. The puzzles involve mostly pushing things to prevent enemies from stopping you.</desc>

		<desc>In this game you are Rad Gravity, a futuristic heroic spaceman.  A mad scientist disrupts the peaceful universe and it is your job to visit various planets to re-establish contact between all the worlds. Sights vary between verdant planets, lava pits and hazardous jumps, with gravity variations and craters.

The game is a platformer and on each world you must fight your way past many enemies. You can collect different weapons and additional health bars which will help you when you face the evil boss. With the main computer you can choose your next destination - but many puzzles rely on the usage of items found on a different world; e.g. an alien-translator.</desc>

		<name>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends</name>
		<desc>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel.  The game plays out much like an episode of the show.  The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum.  Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.

Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls.  Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show. During the platforming sections you can switch instantly between the two protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for short instances.</desc>

Control in this typical platform game consists of jumping and throwing rocks.  Avoid many obstacles such as rolling barrels; defeat persistent enemies such as pirates, mice, and even a giant octopus.  Help Tom navigate down the Mississippi River, through forests, haunted houses, and the sky above.</desc>

		<desc>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

		<name>Air Fortress</name>
		<desc>The Federation of Intergalactic Powers is under threat by gigantic fortress spaceships which have suddenly appeared and destroyed nearby civilization. When conventional defense tactics fail, the Federation looks to find a specially selected person, Hal Bailman and equip him with a special "Lightship". His mission will to be to fly through the defenses of the eight known Air Fortresses and dock at the airlock. Then he must travel through the fortress in only a spacesuit to find and destroy the central core. Once the central core is destroyed, Hal must then quickly find the emergency lightship and escape before the fortress explodes.

The game is made up of two parts. The first part is a side-scrolling shooter on the surface of the air fortress where you must avoid various flying enemies and try to destroy as many waves as possible. This lasts until you dock with the airlock. Once docked, you walk the inside of the Air Fortress at your own pace. Hal is equipped with a jetpack rather than a jump as well as a blaster weapon and a more powerful bomb weapon. Any movement or firing you do consumes energy which is regenerated by standing still. Your goal is to blow up the core and find the escape ship before explosion.

Power-ups to increase Energy or Bombs can be found in each part of the game. Additionally, Super-bombs (clear screen of enemies) and Invulnerability can be found while flying the lightship.</desc>

		<desc>irball is a computer game released in 1987 by Microdeal. It was programmed by Ed Scio, with graphics by Pete Lyon, music by Paul Shields, and level design by Pete Scott. Lyon was the artist for other Microdeal games in the late 1980s, such as Goldrunner. A version for the NES was under development by Novotrade and Tengen (without a Nintendo license), but cancelled. Can You Outwit the Wizard? You have no time to lose! An evil wizard has transformed you into a fragile ball with a tiny hole that is gradually leaking precious air. Trapped in a huge mansion of over 150 rooms, you must watch out for hidden dangers that threaten to puncture your delicate skin while you desperately seek rooms which contain airpumps to replenish your dwindling supply. But pay close attention to your pressure gauge. As long as you remain on the pump your internal pressure will continue to rise and will cause you to explode if you don't break away in time! It's a race against time and your only hope is to find the evil wizard's spellbook which contains the secret to regaining your human form. Can you outwit the wizard before he deflates your existence?</desc>

If you think it's scary on the outside, wait till you see the basement. You're in for the longest night of your life. Ghosts, goblins, demons, wolves, bats – creatures lurking around every corner. As you descend deeper and deeper, they get thicker and thicker. Better stick close to the cavern floor - it's your only chance of finding a weapon or two. You're gonna need 'em. Because when you finally meet the Count, you know he'll be going for the jugular. So keep your courage up and your stake sharp. And say your prayers.</desc>

		<name>Akumajou Special : Boku Dracula-kun</name>
		<desc>Kid Dracula is an unusual side-scroller from Konami.  It's  a parody of the company's popular Castlevania series. Instead of playing as a member of the Belmont family, you play as young Kid Dracula.

You have been woken up from your sleep by the evil demon Garamos, who's been wrecking havoc in Dracula's Castle. It's up to you to stop him by traveling across several different locations, including Dracula's Castle, New York, the Sea, and Egypt!

Gameplay consists of very standard jump and shoot platform action.  As you progress through the 8 levels, you gain the ability to perform spells, such as turning into a bat, and different special attacks, such as a spread / homing attack. You can also spend the coins you get when you defeat enemies in one of several mini-games that show up when you're between levels.</desc>

		<name>Al Unser Jr. Turbo Racing</name>
		<desc>Unlike its namesake, the IndyCar racer  Al Unser Jr., this game depicts Formula 1 races. A season consists of sixteen races, each one consisting of unlimited practice, one qualifying lap and the real race (the starting position depends on the qualifying result). Of course the goal is to win the championship by having successful race results. Those results also change the amount of "set-up points", which represent the quality of the car, players can use before the next race. Besides the championship there is also a time trial mode available (with or without AI opponents).

While the game features manual gear switching, it tends more to an action oriented gameplay than a simulation: pit stops (needed when the car gets nearly destroyed after accidents) stop the time for every driver and players can use a limited amount of turbo boosts. Players can start their own racing team or play as Al Unser Jr., which results in always having the best car possible.</desc>

		<name>Alex DeMeo's Race America</name>
		<desc>Race America is a 2-car cross-country racing game. Either 2 players can compete on the same screen, or the computer can control the second player. The game provides eight colorful opponents to race against, each of whom is supposed to have distinct advantages in a race. Each race begins from a side-scrolling perspective as the 2 competitors speed out of the gate. After a certain distance, the perspective shifts to third person and the driver in the lead occupies the top half of the screen while the driver in second is relegated to half of the lower screen. Occasionally, the game also employs an overhead view. To add to the challenge, the game's cars have 6-speed manual transmissions which players must shift using the control pad, but not while pressing the gas button.</desc>

		<desc>Alfred the chicken must rescue his friends and his bird (pardon the pun) Floella from the Meka Chickens. The result is a platform game across differently-themed levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</desc>

		<name>Alien 3</name>
		<desc>Alien³ on the NES is similar to Probe Software's adaptations of the film on other systems. While using the same overall game concept as the Sega and Commodore versions, the NES title has unique levels.

The player controls Ripley through a number of platform levels. She must not only defend herself against hordes of aliens and find the exit, but also save a number of prisoners, all within a tight time limit of only minutes per level.

Weapons to use against the aliens include a pulse rifle, flame thrower, grenade launcher as well as hand grenades. Ammo for each is limited and must be collected in the levels. The rifle is prone to overheating, so should only be fired in short bursts.

Next to health packs, Ripley can also find a radar. The radar indicates both moving aliens as well as the locations of prisoners.

After every two levels, a guardian level follows, in which an especially tough alien must be defeated to continue.</desc>

Your job is to run around and rescue all the captives and make it to the escape hatch before the time bomb explodes. Then face the mother alien at the end of the level.

You can play as a single player or two people, taking turns. (Player 2 starts the game after Player 1 dies and vice versa.)</desc>

		<name>All-Pro Basketball</name>
		<desc>Video round ball seems to come in a variety of court sizes and player numbers. All-Pro Basketball combines five-on-five full-court action with a half-court screen view.

All-Pro style B-ball features several different play options. Go head-to-head with a friend in a one-game contest. Or, watch two computer teams battle it out on court. If you choose league competition your task is to lead your team to the league championship. In Two Player league play you and a buddy team up to battle the computer teams. Choose your squad from eight professional rosters - ranging from the New York Slicks to the San Francisco Bayriders. Each team has their own strengths and weaknesses.

When the scene is set, the game begins with a jump ball and then it's non-stop no-holds-barred B-ball. On offense you're the team - running, jumping, jump passing, shooting, and even going for three pointers or slam dunks. On defense make a steal or grab a rebound. And remember this is real video basketball. You get called for fouls and your teammates get tired. When their health and stamina get low it's up to you to put them on the bench for a rest.</desc>

Using your defense ship 'Syd,' you must destroy the invading forces and ground targets with bombs. Obtain power-ups to gain energy for ship upgrades that allow you to transform to a more powerful machine. The game itself is a vertical shooter, moving continuously up towards the top of the screen.</desc>

		<name>Amagon</name>
		<desc>In Amagon, your mission is to investigate a dangerous, monster-infested island.  As Amagon, you begin the game with only a machine gun and a limited amount of ammo to protect yourself from the inhabitants of the island. Gameplay is an arcade style platform game with six levels, each with a variety of creatures and a large boss at the end. When you destroy an enemy, a power up will sometimes be left behind. Collecting these can give you extra points, an extra life, more ammo, or a mega key. If you have enough points and collect a mega key, you then have the ability to transform into Megagon. In this form, you are larger in size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you, points are lost. When all of the mega points are gone you will transform back into your normal size.</desc>

		<name>Anticipation</name>
		<desc>Anticipation is a video board game for one to four players (both computer and human). The object of the game is to be the first to collect a card for each of the four colors on the game board. During each turn the computer will display seemingly random dots, then a pencil starts connecting the dots to form a picture. The first player to correctly identify the picture will earn a card for the color of the picture being drawn. As the picture draws, a dice on the screen will count down from 6 to 1. Whatever value is showing when a player successfully identifies the picture is the number of spaces that players game piece will move on the game board for the next turn. The color of the space the game piece lands on will dictate the category for the next picture to be drawn. 

Each game will choose four categories from the various options, which include: tools, man made, clothing, food, math, office, travel, music, things, natural, leisure, and many others. After you've mastered the easier skill levels, the difficulty can be increased which will present more complicated pictures, remove some of the dots from the picture, or eliminate the dots entirely.</desc>

		<name>Archon : The Light and the Dark</name>
		<desc>A chess board is lined with trolls, wizards, knights and other magical beings. Just another strategy game? Don't count on it. When you challenge a square held by the enemy, the board explodes into a battlefield. Your strategic skills on the game board will determine your fate in battle as you take on your opponent in a heartpounding duel to the death.

With sixteen different characters and an ever-changing board, you'll never play the same game twice.

If the Goblin catches air with his club, the swift sword of the Knight may steal a leg or two.

The Sorceress has no fear of the massive, boulder-heaving Golem. One of her powerful spells could quickly send him into the next time zone.

Explosive battles! Fire an arrow, cast a lightning bolt, or scorch your opponent with a fire ball. Seven magic spells! Imprison the enemy, heal your creature's wounds, reverse the flow of time and more. Summon the Elementals! Air, Water, Fire and Earth are all at your command. One or two-player action! Challenge the computer or test your skills against a friend.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.
The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.
By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<name>Arkista's Ring</name>
		<desc>An evil character named Shogun has stolen the Elven ring of Arkista, and in so doing has plunged the whole Elf kingdom into darkness. All the elves hope lies in one elf warrior named Christine.  Equipped in the beginning with only a bow, she proceeds to find the ring and restore her home back to normal.

This is a game that may be compared to The Legend of Zelda, though more linear in it's game play. The game is broken down into many stages, the goal of each being to simply find a way into the next stage.  Playing out in puzzle fashion, you will shoot all the enemies on screen, earn the hidden key, and find the correct exit.  Defeated enemies will randomly drop bonuses that can be collected; these items include health restore, increased armor, and weapon improvements.

Beating the entire game requires successful progression through 125 stages.</desc>

		<name>Assimilate</name>
		<desc>Assimilate itself is a very simple retro-style game, in the mold of the NES's earliest titles which were mostly ports from the arcades. You control an alien spaceship named Ossan. The goal of each level is to maneuver Ossan around a series of deadly projectiles and enemies while kidnapping and assimilating the humans below. Scoop up a human with your tractor beam and use one of four tools to convert them into your alien slave. Then, plant them back in the same building from which you picked them up without dropping them. The level is completed when you have assimilated 100% of the humans in the level.</desc>

		<name>Attack of the Killer Tomatoes</name>
		<desc>Based off the cartoon show of the same name, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes places young Chad Finletter on a quest to make his way past evil mutant tomatoes and stop the crazy Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen from unleashing his Doomsday Tomato. With all the citizens of San Zucchini terrified of the fanged vegetables coming from the sewers, Chad will be on his own to take on the tomato scourge. The doctor doesn't take him lightly, however, and has sent his special tomato squad, Zoltan, Beefstake, Mummato, Fang, Ketchuck and Tomacho, to stop him.

The game is a side-scrolling platform jumping game where the main method of stopping the killer tomatoes is to jump on them. From that they'll either splatter, run away or transform into smaller tomato bits. Energy Power-ups exist to refill Chad's health.</desc>

		<name>Back To The Future</name>
		<desc>In Back to the Future, 80s teen Marty McFly is mistakenly send 30 years into the past where he disrupts his own parents from meeting. Faced with extinction at the hands of a temporal paradox, Marty must find a way to reunite his future parents and make it back to his own time.

LJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.

Street running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).</desc>

		<desc>Welcome to the world of Bad News Baseball, a place where rabbits serve as umpires, home runs escape the earth's atmosphere, and batters are knocked unconscious when they make an out.

Bad News Baseball is a Japanese import for a younger audience. The game has two leagues - the Ultra and Super leagues - with 12 teams that represent major league cities which use fictional team and player names. There are several modes to choose from at the start of the game. You can play a One Player tournament versus the computer: pick a team and play against every other team once. Or, you can play a three-game series against a friend. There's also an all-star mode, which enables you to build a 23-player team from the rosters of one of the leagues. And if you want to watch a game, there's a spectator mode.</desc>

		<desc>Side-scroller in which you get to beat up innocent people. Although it's seems kind of strange, the game is just that: walk around the street as a wrestler wannabe and beat up grannies, blind men, gorillas and other bystanders. But try not to get beaten as the granny attempts to give you some of your own medicine by flailing her purse at you.

Kicks and punches are your basic moves at first, but as the game progresses and you advance levels, new moves and attacks become available, and new people to beat up as well. It's public mayhem way before the likes of Grand Theft Auto.</desc>

		<name>Balloon Fight</name>
		<desc>In Balloon Fight you need to fly around with the aid of two balloons and try to pop your opponents balloons before they pop yours. Landing on top of your opponents will cause their balloon to pop and they will use a parachute to fall to safety. You then need to destroy the fallen opponent by running into it before it can blow up a new balloon and rejoin the battle. Should both of your balloons get popped, you will fall into the water below and lose a life. There is also a second game variation called "balloon trip" where you need to collect as many balloons as possible while avoiding the ocean below and lightning which forms maze like walls.</desc>

		<name>Bandai Golf : Challenge Pebble Beach</name>
		<desc>One or Two players can play a round on this video course modeled after the real Pebble Beach. Each player can select their own handicap. Every one of the 18 holes has familiar golf hazards - bunkers, slopes, and water hazards. You'll also have to contend with some of Mother Nature's hazards like changing wind conditions and Pebble Beach's most difficult obstacle - the ocean.

Once you tee off you'll have all kinds of decisions to make. Check your score card to see how you're doing. The card tells you the distance in yards and par for each hole. The computer gives you a bird's-eye view and cross-sectional view of each hole, as well as close-ups of the green. You select the right club for each shot. Control your shot to get the power, distance, and hook or slice you want on the ball. After you've made your shot the computer tells you what kind of lie you have as well as the remaining distance to the hole.</desc>

		<name>Bandit Kings of Ancient China</name>
		<desc>In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial Minister Gao Qiu.  The Song Dynasty comes to an end, and Gao Qiu became the new ruler.  You take the role of an exiled ruler, and you must build your stats up to be able to challenge- and destroy- Gao Qiu and restore Hui Zhong to the throne.

The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei's games, but instead of conquering a country, the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China.  You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles.  You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.</desc>

Long ago, when magic still prevailed, the evil wizard Mangar the Dark threatened a small but harmonious country town called Skara Brae. Evil creatures oozed into Skara Brae and joined his shadow domain. Mangar froze the surrounding lands with a spell of Eternal Winter, totally isolating Skara Brae from any possible help. Then, one night the town militiamen all disappeared. The future of Skara Brae hung in the balance. And who was left to resist? Only a handful of unproven young Warriors, junior Magic Users, a couple of Bards barely old enough to drink, and some out of work Rogues. You are there. You are the leader of this ragtag group of freedom fighters. Luckily you have a Bard with you to sing your glories, if you survive. For this is the stuff of legends. And so the story begins...</desc>

		<desc>In Baseball Simulator 1.000 you can choose from four different leagues; three with six preset teams each and one where you can build the teams yourself from scratch. Face the computer or challenge a friend to compete in a 5, 30, 60, or 165 game season. Games take place in six stadiums.

As the manager you build up your team by allocating a set bunch of points for batting average, home runs, running speed, and fielding ability among your players. Then, you customize your pitching staff by divvying up points for ERA, speed, right and left curve balls, sinking pitches, and stamina. Your managerial responsibilities also include deciding who's right-handed and who's a lefty, and whether your pitchers throw overhand or sidearm.

You can also play in the Ultra League. Ultra League play enables you to give your hitters and pitchers special skills, such as the ability to pitch balls that zig zag, or hit balls that explode on contact.</desc>

You can create, name, upgrade, and manage your own team, as well as customize the team's logo and colors.  You can also change the stats of each individual player by paying him or her more money (earned from winning games).

There are eight already-created gimmick teams that you can also play with, including the American Dreams, Lovely Ladies, and the Ghastly Monsters.  You can set up a custom league which will keep complete stats on all players in the league.  All games are played in the famous SNK Stadium.</desc>

		<desc>Bases Loaded 3 was Jaleco's latest entry into the popular baseball series in 1991. Changes over the previous title included slightly more detailed fielders, a new field perspective (home plate at the top of the screen, center field at the bottom), an editable team, and a new goal: to play the perfect game of baseball against the computer. Simply winning the game was no longer enough; the gamer now had to avoid common baseball missteps such as making an error and striking out, in order to earn a perfect rating. Against the very clever computer pitching, this could prove quite difficult.</desc>

		<desc>Bases Loaded 4 was Jaleco's last 8-bit entry in the long-running baseball series. The game featured slightly more elaborate animations than its predecessor, and much larger fielders. Removed was the goal to play a flawless game; instead the game featured more traditional modes, including exhibition games and full season play.

Geared more toward faced-paced arcade gameplay than simulation, Bases Loaded 4 was not licensed by Major League Baseball or the Major League Baseball Players' Association. Therefore, it did not feature real American (or Japanese, for that matter) teams or players.</desc>

		<desc>In this version of Bases Loaded you coach your team through a 130-game season in either an Eastern or western division of a professional baseball league. Win the pennant and you're off to the World Series! You can also play head-to-head with a friend.

Choose from six teams in each division. Once you take your place in the dugout you're the manager, juggling your own lineup and battling order. You'll also have to somewhat of a psychologists as you learn to interpret the Player Performance Ratings. This unique feature of Bases Loaded II rates each player in three categories: physical, sensitivity, and intellectual. Each rating is like a biorhythm, going up and down, just like in real life. The Player Performance Ratings simulate what players really go through - streaks and slumps.
Bases Loaded II also features similar realistic on-field action that was present in the first game of the series.</desc>

		<name>Bashi Bazook : Morphoid Masher</name>
		<desc>The year is 2081. The Earth has become a devastated planet, overrun by monsters, controlled by a mysterious entity known as Increaser. The only hope to save the beloved Earth lies with you, a young warrior named Dan. You are sent in a time machine to the year 1999, when the monster invasion was beginning. Your task is to find your way through monster-infested labyrinths and to defeat the Increaser – whatever he (or it) is.

The game is an action platformer with more emphasis on exploration than on "jump &amp; run" gameplay. You don't die immediately if a monster touches you, but have a life bar that gets gradually depleted as you are hit. Defeated enemies bring you energy points, which you can spend to buy upgrades. You start with a sword, but later obtain other weapons as well. The game's structure is not entirely linear; many areas have different doors leading to different places.</desc>

		<name>Batman : Return of the Joker</name>
		<desc>The Joker lives again in SunSoft's sequel to their NES 
original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must fight him across seven stages to restore peace to Gotham City.

Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses. 

Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.

Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers. Two levels require you to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep pace in the background. Some levels also have Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short side-scrolling shooter. 

This game is one of the few Batman games that was not based directly on a movie or television series.</desc>

		<name>Batman : The Video Game</name>
		<desc>The NES version of Batman: The Video Game is loosely based on the 1989 movie. It is a side-scrolling game, with a blue dressed Batman fighting enemies such as robots, jet-packed soldiers, ninjas and mutants.

The game consists in five levels somewhat related to the movie: Gotham City streets (with Killer Moth as the final boss), AXIS Chemical Factory (with Machine Intelligence System as boss), Underground Conduit (with Electrocutioner as boss), the Laboratory Ruins (the Dual-Container Alarm as boss) and Gotham's Cathedral (with Firebug as boss) where Batman finally faces the Joker. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed.

Besides his ever trusting punches, Batman has plenty of weapons in his utility belt: the Batarang, the Spear Gun and the Dirk (a three direction weapon). Batman has an ammunition counter shared for the three weapons. The Batarang takes one pellet per shot, the Spear Gun two pellets and the Dirk, three. Batman also has an eight hit life bar, which can be replenished by collecting hearts dropped by killed enemies. The enemies will also drop pellet items (10 pellets per item) and bonus items (which will only sum up points).

Batman can also perform a "wall jump": he'll grab a wall when jumping toward it, allowing him to escalate some narrow passages. Batman has three lives and unlimited continues.</desc>

		<name>Batman Returns</name>
		<desc>Like Konami's other adaptation of Batman Returns, the NES version is a side-scrolling beat 'em up. Next to brawling action, it also features two sections where the player controls the Batmobile and the Batskiboat seen in the movie.

In the beat 'em up sections, Batman has to defeat a large number of enemies (members of the Penguin's circus gang) to advance. Possible attacks include punches, sliding attacks, drop kicks and a powerful 360° cape slash attack which will drain Batman's health bar. Gadgets to be used include a limited number of batarangs and a grappling hook. The hook is useful for many things: it can take down flying enemies, pull Batman up to higher levels, lets him climb into open windows and more. Hidden in background items somewhere in the levels are power-ups, including hearts that refill the health bar and extra batarangs.

Each of the six levels in the game concludes with a boss fight against one or more especially powerful enemies.

The Batmobile is armed with machine guns and bat discs, used to dispatch the enemy bikes and cars in the driving level. The Batskiboat section is similar, except that there are no enemies and the only goal is to collect coins for extra points.</desc>

		<desc>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. 

The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. 

Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.</desc>

		<name>Battle Kid : Fortress Of Peril</name>
		<desc>Battle Kid: Fortress Of Peril is a homebrew 2D platform video game, released in February 2010 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, created by American developer Sivak Games, and published through Retrozone with the cover art designed by Larry Bundy Jr. Unlike most games in the modern era, Battle Kid is available for purchase only on a physical NES cartridge. While there has been a demand for a downloadable version, the developer has stated that the game is currently not planned to be released on any other formats due to a contract with Retrozone.</desc>

		<name>Battle Kid 2 - Mountain Of Torment</name>
		<desc>Battle Kid 2 is a homebrew developed for Sivak Games that mixes the concepts of “I Wanna Be The Guy” (for the design of the hero and his pistol and for the “Die and Retry” mechanics), and Mega Man (for the boss battles) .
The hero dies as soon as he is hit, but the player has infinite continues.
There are 500 rooms, 30 different types of enemies and multiple difficulty options.
The second opus added new features like new types of ice block, enemies and mud, an improved "Wall-Grip", a death counter and an introduction level.</desc>

		<name>The Battle of Olympus</name>
		<desc>This game is much like Zelda II: The Adventure of Link turned into ancient Greece. You play as Orpheus, whose girlfriend, Helene, has been kidnapped by the demonic ruler of the netherworld called Hades. So begins the journey.

Just like in Zelda II, there is a top-down map of Greece with towns and other locations to explore. Each of these has side-scrolling sections in which Orpheus fights his way through the minions of Hades. There are various items one must get to continue to the next location, including swords, shields and crystals. There are three fragments of love hidden around; Orpheus has to find them before he can enter Tartarus and fight Hades to save his beloved Helene.

The monsters of the game are also based on the Greek mythology and it is pretty entertaining to confront cyclopes, minotaurs and pegasuses.</desc>

		<desc>Battle City is a refined version of Namco's old arcade game Tank Battalion. Destroy different enemy tanks, while trying to keep them away from your base. When you have destroyed 20 enemy tanks you advance to the next level with different layout. In each level there's some obstacles which you can use to your advantage. Obstacles include red bricks which you can shoot out of your way, silver bricks which are highly armored, water and ice. You start the game with a basic tank, which you can power up to better one little by little. 

The NES game includes a construction mode, so you can make your own levels when you have played through all the 35 original levels.</desc>

		<desc>Battleship for the NES is like the pen and paper battleship game with a few notable differences. The changes include the grid size that is 12 by 8 instead of the standard 10 by 10, the 3-grid unit long submarine has been removed, and only one shot can be made per turn regardless of if it hits or not. The most notable difference is that multiple weapons can be used. Each ship carries a special weapon that can fire many missiles many points across a set grid, for instance in an X pattern. The bigger the ship, the larger the grid area. Each ship can only shoot the special missile once per game and if the ship carrying the weapon is destroyed then the weapon becomes unusable.</desc>

Spiders, grasshoppers, assorted bugs, and even lawn sprinklers are all over the place and try to stop bee 52 from reaching the many flowers where honey can be collected. Even after collecting honey, you may need to defend your nest against ants who will try to sneek in and steal honey from you. Bee 52 is armed, however, and can sting or shoot many of the enemies that get in the way. Some levels even have bugs that, when shot, will provide bee 52 with more powerful firepower temporarily. Bee 52 is a side scrolling shooter which can be played by one or two players.</desc>

		<name>Beerslinger</name>
		<desc>Beerslinger is a time management game with a concept similar to the arcade classic Tapper. It is the second game in the Holiday series by the developer, this time made for Saint Patrick's Day.

The player controls a bartender who needs to serve customers in a pub. Each level is a different day and introduces two bars, one with the beers on tap and one where customers sit down and order. Based on the customer's order the bartender needs to fill up the mug with the correct type of beer (e.g. IPA, lager, stout, wheat) and serve it in time. A timer below the customer's stool shows the remaining time and if the bartender messes up three times by being too late or serving the wrong type, he is fired and the game is over. The goal is to make it through the seven days of the week. Each day also has a cash target.

A single button is used to fill up the mug and then again to serve it. The second button is used to empty the mug when it does not contain the correct type of beer to get rid of it. The customers order using a voice sample expressing their choice in addition to the next on screen. Levels gradually get more difficult, introducing multiple types of beer and more room for patrons who also turn up faster. Starting with two kegs and two stools the game ends with four kegs and six stools.</desc>

After you choose your fighter for his parameters (strength, stamina and resistance), you can choose from 55 different moves.
You can now train your fighter at a gym before the real fights.
To master the game, one must alternate training and fights, as training improves stamina, strength and resistance.
Be careful, loosing a fight reduces those parameters, so you have to be ready before getting on the ring !</desc>

		<name>Bible Buffet</name>
		<desc>This is a Bible trivia/action game in which you spin a spinner and move the number of spaces it says. 

When you land on your spot, if it is just a regular spot, you play an action game for points, upgraded or better weapons, hearts, etc. If the space you land on has a red circle, you spin again. If the space you land on has a red circle connected to another red circle by dashes, you move forward or backwards to the second circle. If the space has a red circle with a question mark in it, you take a pop quiz of  three trivia questions then get to select either a key, a heart or move ahead one, two, three or four spaces. 

When you spin, if you don't get a number but instead get the book, you get a pop quiz of three questions. If you get the happy face, something good happens like move ahead ten space, get a key, get a heart, etc. If you get the sad face, something bad happens like lose your turn, move back 1 space and lose turn, etc. 

When you take a quiz, if you answer all three questions right, you get a star.

At the end of the game, a bonus is awarded to the player who got to the end first and/or got the most pop quiz stars and/or collected the most food then all the points are shown for each player.</desc>

		<desc>On a Tuesday afternoon sometime in 17 million BC, Big Nose the caveman was on his way to the Savings and Bones to deposit a large amount of savings. But before he got there, Leroy the Lizardman knocked out Big Nose and stole his savings. When Big Nose woke up and realized his savings were gone, he freaked out! Now he created a wheel with a platform on it and is out to get Leroy. Big Nose Freaks Out is a side scrolling platform action game. There are five sections of gameplay each with four levels to clear. At the end of each section Leroy will be waiting with a large monster. To fight back Big Nose has his trusty club with him. Also, rocks can be found along the way and the club used to bat them at enemies. There are many hidden treasures, hidden levels, and even some level warps to search for.</desc>

		<name>Big Nose the Caveman</name>
		<desc>Long, long time ago (but not necessarily in a galaxy far, far away), there was a caveman named Big Nose. One day he went out of his cave and saw a pterodactyl flying around. "That will be my dinner", - thought Big Nose, took out his trusty club and ran after the winged reptile. Naturally, his quest for nutrition became much longer and more dangerous than he had ever imagined...

In this platform action game, you guide Big Nose through prehistoric levels, fighting prehistoric animals of various kinds.

		<name>Bigfoot</name>
		<desc>Monster truck game where you go from LA to NYC through different kinds of races.

At every stop, you first drive a qualification round against your opponent, which is in top-down perspective. Here, you can collect money and several power-ups to use to win against your opponent. After this qualification, you go into a side perspective head to head race, where you have to push left and right continuously. In this view there are all sorts of events, including Car Crush, Mud Race and Drag Race. Before these races, you can (read: must) also buy upgrades for your cars, with the money you collected in the qualify race.

The game is supported to play 2 players.</desc>

		<name>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure</name>
		<desc>Bill and Ted are two surfer-speaking 1980s high school dudes from San Dimas, California.  After the events of the film Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, they seem free to build the band that will one day unite Earth's people and bring about world peace.  Except...  Rufus returns from the future with a warning that someone has warped the time continuum by kidnapping historical figures and stranding them in the wrong time period (...sooo, basically what Bill and Ted did in the first film?)  It's up to the boys to sort out the mess.

The player controls either Bill or Ted, who have split up to tackle the quest (allowing each to leave items to assist the other). Each "mission" begins by consulting a phone book of historical figures, and spotting the page whose number has changed (a second number, flashing in red).  The player dials that number, and guides the phone booth through the circuits of time. Rufus could only lend a payphone, so players will need to plot out the shortest path to their destination, while avoiding any hazards. Each change in direction costs one coin.

Once in the target time period, the player controls Bill or Ted through an isometric view as they search for the displaced historical figure.  The player must stick to a defined path to avoid falling, and must be cautious of the locals.  Some will offer clues or helpful items, while others demand a coin if bumped into.  Other locals will actively chase Bill and Ted and throw them in jail, where they must use a skeleton key (if they have one) to escape. Players can find and collect coins for the phone booth, keys for the jail, and distractions (like pudding or tape players) to throw off any pursuers.

The player must also locate an item of "historical bait," appropriate to the target, to get them to follow. Once the historical dude has been baited and bagged, the player switches to the other member of the titular duo to rescue a new historical celebrity. The process repeats until time is corrected.</desc>

It was the recipient of an extremely positive profile in Nintendo Power - "extremely positive" being NP's default setting back in the day - but then vanished, presumably never to be seen again. Last week, though, the archivists at Lost Levels not only acquired the long-lost prototype cartridge, but uploaded a playable version of it to the Internet.</desc>

		<desc>In The Black Bass you are an angular in a Black Bass fishing tournament. In this tournament, you start out on Lake Amanda as a rating C class angular in 200th position. You must find a good position on the lake to fish as the size, type (fish types: Black Bass, Brown Trout, Rainbow Trout, and Pike), quantity of fish, and obstacles vary depending on were you are on the lake. Once you selected your ideal location, you cast out the lure using a power meter and as you slowly reel it back in. You must try to attract the interested fish by wiggling the lure in the water and if the fish grabs the lure you must reel the fish back in making sure that the line does not snap as well as avoiding any obstacles in the way.

To help you have many lures to choose from (more been unlocked as you progress though the game) as well as a guide to tell you how good you currently selected location is. You have one day in game time to catch the biggest Black Bass you can find as at the end of the day the average weight of you caught Black Bass improves or reduces you rating as well overall position. Your rating determines how far you progress in the tournament unlocking new lakes (lakes: Lake Amada, Japan Lake, Lake More, San Lake).</desc>

		<name>Blades of Steel</name>
		<desc>Based on the arcade game, Blades Of Steel is a hockey arcade action game (gameplay doesn't require the need to worry about statistics or provide the ability to customize teams.) Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer. In one player mode there are single game and tournament mode options.  From time to time a fight may break out, which will provide a close up view of the two players. The player has control during the miniature fight game sequence, with the loser having to spend time in the penalty box.  The referee will break up fights that go on too long, and calls a few penalties such as icing. Several short clips of digitized voices are also featured.</desc>

Side-by-side two-player competition. Complete a layer and dump it on your opponent! Featuring a unique 3-D perspective - BLOCKOUT releases the power of your 16-bit Genesis. 11 difficulty levels - novice to advanced.

		<name>Blow'em Out!</name>
		<desc>Blow'em Out! is a homebrew game that is the first in the developer's Holiday series of holiday themed homebrew games. The idea was that a physical version of this game could be gifted to a retro gamer for a birthday as the end of the game could be personalized to contain the recipient's name. The game consists of ten single, fixed screen levels. Each level contains a birthday cake with candles on it. To win a level a boy or a girl, chosen at the start of the game, needs to blow out all candles. The cake often has multiple layers (platforms) that can be reached by jumping. Sometimes there is also jelly that can be used to jump and reach a high area.

Some levels contain small floating flames that need to be avoided. These flames can also reignite some of the candles. The candles are put out by blowing, with a button press, and this can also be used to push the floating flames back.

The later Genesis version has upgraded music, more challenging enemies and the character can now drop down directly from a layer of birthday cake.</desc>

		<name>The Blue Marlin</name>
		<desc>The Blue Marlin is a big, strong, quick fish with a long nose. To catch such a fish is the dream of any fisherman. A great fishing competition begins this summer in Florida and Hawaii. You are invited to participate in it. Will you be able to demonstrate your fisherman skills and win the competition?

"The Blue Marlin" is a fishing simulation. You start out in Florida and work your way through various fishing stages in Florida and Hawaii. Each stage contains three different locations. You navigate your boat from a top-down view, choose an appropriate place, and then start fishing. You can choose the length of the line, how deep you put it into water, what lure you use, etc. The more you fish, and the better fish you catch, the better stats you gain.</desc>

		<name>Bo Jackson Baseball</name>
		<desc>Bo Jackson was the first all-star athlete in two major sports, Baseball and American Football. Bo Jackson Baseball is a game about Bo Jackson baseball career. This game plays lake a standard baseball nine (or 5 – 8 if you wish) innings baseball game. There are three difficulty levels giving access to players at all still levels. When pitching you are given 5 different pitch types that pitcher chooses by pressing the correct directional button before the pitch, therefore keeping it hidden from your opponent. Batting is done the same way but the type of hit is chosen as the batter hits the ball.

At any moment, base sneaking can be made (by the batter) or stopped (by the pitcher). Fielding is only done using the CPU, but once the fielder gets the ball then you must choose what base to throw to using the directional buttons. All of the teams are just city names and players, all with different stats, are fictional except for Bo Jackson himself who is hidden in the game.</desc>

		<name>Bomberman</name>
		<desc>Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

		<name>Bomberman II</name>
		<desc>Our hero the white Bomberman (Bomberman Shiro) was walking down the street one day when he witnessed a robbery. It was black Bomberman (Bomberman Kuro) who was the robber. But Black Bomberman knocked White Bomberman to the ground, and than left the money so that he would be framed. Now Bomberman has been taken to jail and must fight his way out of this place using the only method he knows: explosive bombs.

Bomberman is the second Bomberman game in the series and plays similar to the first, only all gameplay has been reduced to a single screen. Your goal however remains the same on a smaller playing area. You are to destroy all enemies on a level and then find the exit to the next one. Bombing the exit is always a bad idea. The occasional power-up will increase your bomb blast, number of bombs on the screen at one time, player speed or give you the ability to walk through walls.

In addition to the single Player game, Bomberman II introduces a Versus Mode for 2 players and a Battle Mode for 3. Your goal in these is to destroy the other players while staying alive yourself.</desc>

The game is very similar to every other platform game you have ever played, but it does have its own unique features such as the ability to climb vertical walls with your teeth and do a diving head butt from a jump. Power ups come in the form of lumps of meat and give extra speed and invulnerability in the later stages.

If you have ever played chuck rock then you know what to expect from this, a bog standard platform game with a prehistoric theme.</desc>

Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.</desc>

		<name>Perfect Bowling</name>
		<desc>Perfect Bowling is a Japan-only Famicom bowling game, in which the player competes with other computer opponents. Each of the opponents has their own name, appearance and style of play. The game seems to take place in the future, with lanes restocking pins with lasers and certain characters dressed in strange, futuristic (or at least an 80s interpretation of futuristic) fashions. This is a complete departure from its box art, which seems more reminiscent of the 1950s and 60s.

The game allows for a lot of precision-based options in order to bowl effectively. This includes rotating the ball to put spin on it, selecting the power and hitting the power gauge just right. The player can also select which hand they favor and the weight of the ball during the character creation process.</desc>

		<desc>BoxBoy! It is a puzzle platform video game in which players control a square-shaped character called Qbby. The objective of the game is to guide Qbby through a series of stages full of obstacles that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world focuses on a particular game theme; For example, one world introduces scenarios containing deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes to transport Qbby. The central mechanics of the game is Qbby's ability to create boxes and use them to remove obstacles. The boxes are created one at a time as a connected chain and the maximum number of boxes in a chain varies between each stage. Qbby can separate the chain of boxes and then push it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles,</desc>

		<name>Bram Stoker's Dracula</name>
		<desc>Bram Stroker's Dracula is a side-scroller platform game loosely based on the 1992 film of the same name. Players take the role of Jonathan Harker whose mission to to destroy Count Dracula by first heading to Transylvania and then London.

Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and attack with a weapon, the most basic of which is a knife. The status display on the screen shows Harker's health bar, countdown timer to complete the level and currently held weapon.  Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario games) can be found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration, timer increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections: the "Daytime" and the "Nighttime". These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss creature who must be defeated to progress.</desc>

		<desc>This is a tetris variant with an adult theme. On the bottom of the play field, a naked woman is bathing, sending up bubbles of different colors. Your task is to arrange those bubbles on the top of the play field in such a way that they create a line of several bubbles of the same color. When you succeed, the bubbles of the same color will disappear. When the whole play field is filled by bubbles, you lose. There are two types of gameplay (one grants you powerups which allow you to clear quickly a large amount of bubbles), with four stages each. You'll get various mildly erotic scenes after completing the stages, and a "reward" in the end. There is also a two-player mode.</desc>

Each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

The game plays much like the original game: You use a dinosaur that spits bubbles at their enemies, trapping them until you touch the bubbles to make them pop and defeat the trapped enemies. But Cubby and Rubby have two skills their ancestors did not: by holding down the attack button, they can float upwards - and by releasing it, they'll fire several bubbles at once. They can also pick up special items that increase their points, speed and attack power. This game features 80 levels, all-new enemies, and bonus mini-games.</desc>

		<name>The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout</name>
		<desc>The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout takes place as Bugs is invited to his 50th birthday. Because some of the other Warner Bros. toons weren't invited (including Wile E. Coyote), they decided to stop Bugs from going to this party.

A Warner Bros licensed game, The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout is a 2d side-scrolling platform game. Bugs can jump over and on some enemies and try to collect as many carrots as possible. Bugs can use his hammer in order to smash enemies as well as to find some secrets.</desc>

		<name>Bump 'n' Jump</name>
		<desc>Bump 'N' Jump is an action racing game played from a top down point of view. As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</desc>

		<desc>The Burai, a race of evil super-brain aliens, have launched their plan to conquer the universe with their army of half-organic, half-robot creatures -- the robo-mutants.  It's up to you to stop them!  Strap on your jet pack, and get ready to become the ultimate Burai Fighter.

Burai Fighter is an arcade shooter with two modes of play.  Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts.  A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout.  Either way, you'll be armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything onscreen.

Burai Fighter uses a slightly different gameplay mechanic when compared to other shooters. You can shoot in 8 directions, and when you hold down the fire button you keep shooting in that direction.</desc>

		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Cabal is a shooter where the protagonist runs back and forth along the bottom of the screen, ducking and dodging bullets and grenades from the enemy. The roll maneuver from the arcade was not implemented in the PC version. The player returns fire by moving a target around the screen which also moves the player character and may expose him to enemy fire. 

The enemies throughout the five levels come thick and fast and there are many of them. They include normal foot soldiers, tanks, helicopters and end of level bosses such as submarines and war machines. Just about everything on the screen can be blown up or shot. There are bonus points to be picked up for destroying buildings and weapons to be picked up from the enemy, such as machine guns and shotguns. Two-player mode is available.</desc>

		<desc>California Games was the original "Extreme Games" – what today's generation might call "X-Games in the sun".  Players can select sponsors (absent in some versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX.  The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.

The Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.</desc>

		<name>The California Raisins: The Grape Escape</name>
		<desc>The California Raisins: The Grape Escape is a California Raisins video game developed by Radiance for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Capcom planned to publish the game in 1990 but its release was canceled due to the California Raisins' dwindling popularity because of the decline in raisin sales in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the single-player side-scrolling action game the player controls a California Raisin through five stages in an effort to rescue the band and their band's musical notes that were stolen by the gang of jealous musicians. The player walk, jump, climb on vines, moonwalk (by pressing the "select" button) and shoot an unlimited supply of grape jelly beans as projectiles. As was the case with other Capcom games, such as Mega Man and DuckTales, one can play the first four levels in any order that you want, but the final level is only available after you have collected the musical notes from each of the four levels. The first four levels include The Grape Vine, The Factory, The Maize Maze and The Juicery. The final level takes places in The Clouds. During each level you can collect 'I' icons that give you temporary invincibility, regular black musical notes for bonus points, 'Sunshine' icons to restore your health, and 'Raisinette' icons to give an extra life to the player. One can also locate items by shooting at the thin air or at columns.</desc>

		<name>6 in 1 - Caltron</name>
		<desc>6-in-1 is an unlicensed game that contains a set of six different game in one cartridge that were not released separately. Most of these games is known to have a major resemblances to other games such as Soko-Ban and Pang. It includes the six following games.

You have to fly past all of the obstacles and shoot all of the enemies throughout five stages, with the final sixth stage being a boss fight.

Magic Carpet 1001: This game is a side-scrolling shooter where you are on a magic carpet, armed with only a bow and some arrows to defend yourself from the enemies in the sky throughout four different levels.

Balloon Monster is similar to the game Pang. A huge, bouncing bubble is attacking you from the sky and you have to shoot at it before it kills you. When you try to shoot it, it divides into smaller bubbles, making it harder. This game contains 50 different levels to play through.

Adam and Eve: in this game, you are Adam from the Bible. This game is nothing more than a Balloon Fight clone where the player is supposed to rid the screen of all the floating snakes to make it to the next stage. The player must defeat the floating snakes by popping their balloons then their parachutes. The game also contains an air pump powerup which heals the players damaged balloons. This game contains 40 different levels to play through.

Porter is a puzzle game similar to the game Soko-Ban. In this game, you have to move all of the boxes onto the stars in a limited amount of time, in order to make it to the next stage. This game contains 25 different levels to play through.

Bookyman: is similar to the arcade game Make Trax where you are a bug and you have to paint the entire maze before you are caught by the other enemies. This game contains 8 different levels to play through, with enemies getting increasingly faster the higher the level.</desc>

		<desc>The Mandarin has knocked out Iron Man and the Vision. This time it is personal.

You play as Captain America or Hawkeye. In the one player mode, you must fight your way through various thugs to rescue Iron Man and the Vision. This game is a side scroller, somewhat reminiscent of Bionic Commando in which you fight through a level then move to an overhead map to decide where to go next. In between levels, Wasp gives you hints.

Captain America's attacks are: when he is standing, shield throw; when he is crouching, punch and when he is jumping, kick. Also, if you push twice in a direction, Cap can do a powerful forward charge with his shield for a short distance.

Hawkeye's attacks are all arrow shots. He can shoot left, right, up, upper-left or upper-right.

If you complete an area with one character then complete it with the other character right away, you can press start to switch between Cap or Hawkeye. This has the advantage that Cap's forward charge is powerful and by grabbing poles, he can then jump to areas Hawkeye cannot.

Hawkeye can shoot enemies or targets too high for Cap to jump up and kick.

In the battle mode, this is a two player, one-on-one battle. Player one chooses from Captain America or Hawkeye (the good guys) and player two chooses from Wizard, Ultron or Crossbones (the bad guys).

You fight each other until one player has won three rounds.</desc>

		<name>Captain Comic : The Adventure</name>
		<desc>"You are Captain Comic, galactic hero. Your mission is to recover three treasures from the planet Omsoc, which have been stolen away and hidden on the remote planet of Tambi."

Captain Comic is a platformer featuring a huge nonlinear playfield divided into several different terrains. As Comic, you must search throughout Tambi for power ups and items that will aid you in your quest to recover the three treasures. The Captain's main weapon is 'Blastola Cola', a can of drink that allows him to hurl fireballs at his foes. For each can that he finds, an additional fireball can be thrown.

There are many different paths that are available from the start, but without the right item or weapon, it can be impossible to progress through certain paths, or even to commit suicide. It's up to the player to decide the correct route to take, and which places to return to at a later time.</desc>

		<name>Captain Planet and the Planeteers</name>
		<desc>Based on the cartoon series of the same name, Captain Planet and the Planeteers are environmental protectors. Each Planeteer is endowed with a special elemental power which is used to combat pollution, preserve the enviroment and keep everything ship-shape. When the Planeteers powers combine they summon Captain Planet, a superhero Captain Planet, guardian of the Earth, is summoned. The powers of Gaia keep watch over the world, and assign the Planeteers to where they are needed.

Captain Planet and the Planeteers is an action sidescroller game divided into two sections: Inside levels and outside levels. Outside levels usually put the Planeteers in some kind of vehicle which can move in any of eight directions on the screen. The planeteers can use any of their elemental powers, drained from an energy bar: Fire shoots a fireball directly ahead, Water shoots out a water wave, Wind lets loose a defensive air currents, Earth tosses stones out to the earth and Heart calms animal creatures. Touching an enemy or projectile results in instant death. 

Inside levels summon Captain Planet himself, who can punch or turn himself into a swirling version of any of the five elements. Captain Planet can also move/fly in any of eight directions and also can only take one hit before dying. Power-ups can also be found on these levels.</desc>

If you think it's scary on the outside, wait till you see the basement. You're in for the longest night of your life. Ghosts, goblins, demons, wolves, bats – creatures lurking around every corner. As you descend deeper and deeper, they get thicker and thicker. Better stick close to the cavern floor - it's your only chance of finding a weapon or two. You're gonna need 'em. Because when you finally meet the Count, you know he'll be going for the jugular. So keep your courage up and your stake sharp. And say your prayers.</desc>

		<desc>Castlevania II: Simon's Quest is the second one of three Castlevania games released on the NES. After the vampire killer Simon Belmont destroyed Count Dracula in the original Castlevania (1987), an evil curse possessed him. The only way Simon can break the count's curse is to find five of Dracula's body parts (which are mysteriously strewn throughout Transylvania) and burn them. 

Unlike most of the other Castlevania games, Simon's Quest does not feature the traditional stages but allows you to freely roam the land of Transylvania in the style of Nintendo's Metroid. In several towns Simon can talk with NPC's and buy items in shops, adding a touch of role-playing.</desc>

Unlike most of the other Castlevania games, Simon's Quest does not feature the traditional stages but allows you to freely roam the land of Transylvania in the style of Nintendo's Metroid. In several towns Simon can talk with NPC's and buy items in shops, adding a touch of role-playing.</desc>

		<desc>Championship Bowling plays like a standard 10 frame ten-pin bowling game with the objective to knock down as many pins with the bowling ball as possible.

After picking a lane (5 different designs), a character (4 different characters), and the weight of the bowling ball they will be using, the player is placed on the lane. To bowl the player first picks the location that the bower will bowl from and then, using the ‘Control’ panel, the player must time it correctly to stop the ball at the desired angle and finally, time it correctly to stop the ‘Power’ bar at the desired power. The power, and the weight of the ball determine how much effect the control has. Up to four players can play using the NES Four Score accessory with all players taking turns to bowl.</desc>

		<name>Championship Pool</name>
		<desc>Championship Pool is a pool game where players can 8-ball or 9-ball pool tournament that starts off with the BCA Regional Championship where the player must defeat 32 opponents in a first to four games match. If the player loses against any of the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto the World Championship.

All of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes. 

There are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:

1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship. During the tournament the opponent is never actually is seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the player with a caption and then returns the control to the player with some balls removed and moved. This way the opponent can finish the game within 4 turns regardless of if they where snookered or not.

2. Challenge:  It has many different pool games that are played, all with one player without an opponent. The games are:

1. 14.1 Challenge – After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. At that point, the player can hit any ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole the game is over. If there is only one ball left on the table the rest of the balls are re-racked and play continues. At the end score is given based on the number of balls that where hit in the holes. The score are tallied up over 5 games to get the total score.

2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit all the chosen set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball in one turn.  The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

3. Nine Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one turn. The score is based on how many balls where hit in.

4. Equal Offence – Same as 14.1 Challenge but there is only one game played.

5. Three Pool – Only have 3 balls on the table. Score is based on how many shots it takes to get all three balls in with lower been better.

6. Speed Pool – Objective is to hit all the balls in as quickly as possible as a timer is timing how long the game takes. Any ball can be hit at any time and the player can miss the shot and not be penalised (other than taking longer).

1. Eight Ball (2 Players)  – A standard eight ball game with the players taking turns to play.

9. Ten Ball (2-8 Players)  – Same as Nine Ball except with 10 balls.

10. Rotation (2-8 Players)  – Only the lowest ball can be hit and the score for getting a ball in is the value of the ball (e.g. 8-ball is 8 points). Player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

11. Straight Pool (2 Players)  –  Same as 14.1 Continuous but the player with the highest score after one game wins.

12. Equal Offence (2-8 Players)  –  Same as Equal Offence in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each others score.

		<name>CheetahMen II</name>
		<desc>There were plans for a sequel to Cheetahmen I, but it was not completed (6 of 10 proposed levels were made) and was never officially released. In 1996, however, 1,500 copies of the game were located in a warehouse and eventually put on sale on the secondary market. All copies of the game were reused Action 52 cartridges, some with a small gold sticker reading "Cheetamen II". This cartridge is now very rare and hard to find, though numerous ROM images exist on the Internet. Dr. Morbis is out to destroy the Cheetahmen with all new traps and dangers. It is up to the Cheetahmen to make their way to Dr. Morbis' secret (and heavily guarded) laboratory to battle Dr. Morbis and his sub-humans (including the new, powerful ape-man). Cheetahmen II is a side scrolling platform game with arcade style action. There are three different Cheetahmen to control, a different one every second level.</desc>

		<name>Cheril in Cadaverion</name>
		<desc>Help Cheril in the sixth game in the Cheril Trilogy! You have approximately one minute to escape each of the four floors in the mansion, each floor being composed by five closed chambers. To progress from one chamber to the next, you'll have to open the gate by means of pushing around every statue on the screen to their bases. If you get it wrong you can always restart the room by pressing «fire» over the blueish tile you will find in every room with statues. This will revert the room to the original position.

You must hurry, because if the time runs out you'll have to start the current floor over. Luckily, you can collect hourglasses for some more time, but be careful with the mansion inhabitants, who are everything but friendly.</desc>

This game starts out simply enough, with a mission to rescue a small kitten, but soon escalates into a wider plot that pits the rescue rangers against their arch-nemesis, the feline kingpin, Fat Cat.</desc>

		<name>Chip 'N Dale : Rescue Rangers 2</name>
		<desc>Following the first Rescue Rangers game, the Rangers' overcame the plot of their arch-nemesis Fatcat, and locked him up in the prison/pound. However, Fatcat's henchmen have sprung him from prison by blimp. Suddenly a television news anchor is reporting that there is a bomb threat in a local restaurant. The Rescue Rangers take it upon themselves to save the day only to learn that the whole bomb scare was a diversion in order to allow Fatcat to steal an artifact known as the Urn of the Pharoah. The team must track Fatcat and learn what he has in store for the stolen goods.

Like the previous game, Chip &amp; Dale's Rescue Rangers 2 is a side-scrolling action game where 2 players can play simultaneously as Chip &amp; Dale, or 1 player can control either chipmunk. Our heroes must conquer a series of oversized (from their perspective) stages in order to thwart Fatcat's nefarious schemes. For example, the first stage has the chipmunks hopping across the tables, chairs, and counters of a restaurant, and on through the kitchen. Many enemies try to slow the player's progress. The chipmunks' offensive ability is to pick up any of the copious blocks that litter the landscape and toss it in any of 5 directions (sideways, up, and diagonal-up). Along the way, there are scattered RR blocks for the heroes to collect. The other members of the Rescue Rangers -- Monty, Gadget, and Zipper -- are on hand to lend help out at key junctures.</desc>

		<desc>Professor Plum and his designs for the "doomsday device", DEAD END have been taken by the diabolical LAWBREAKERS - a sinister group dedicated to the destruction of mankind. It's only a matter of time before the device is assembled and the final countdown begins. 
As Sergeant Billy "Big Bang" Blitz of the special Assault Brigade for Real Emergencies(S.A.B.R.E) your mission is to foil the LAWBREAKERS plan. To do this, you must find the shortest route to the summit of Demonhead mountain, where the professor is being held. Rescue the professor and save the world from total destruction. 
This is a "typical" sidescroller with Role playing elements. the various enemies you meet with leave behind cash which can then be used to buy equipment. You'll need a diving suit to swim underwater, a jetpack to get to those hard to reach areas and don't forget the shop card that can be used to call the shop no matter where you are.</desc>

		<name>Classic Concentration</name>
		<desc>Concentration was a popular game show in the mid-to-late 1980s, and this game was adapted from that television program.

Two players can play against each other, or one person can play against a computer generated opponent. The answer to the puzzle is hidden by tiles. The tiles have words denoting game prizes ("Mexico", "Camera", "Telescope", for example), and your object is to find the two matching worded tiles. Exposing two at a time, your memory is taxed as more prize tiles are revealed and then covered over again.  As more tiles are matched, the hidden puzzle is revealed. Solve the puzzle and you win the game.</desc>

		<name>Cliffhanger</name>
		<desc>Cliffhanger is based on the 1993 Sylvester Stallone movie. The lead character, Gabe Walker, is an expert in high mountain search and rescue and receives a distress signal from a plane that has crashed nearby. However, the plane is actually loaded with terrorists who hijacked a large shipment of cash. The game consists of side-scrolling action. The hero can walk, run, jump, punch, and kick while jumping. Further, he can perform special feats as the situation requires, such as crossing a rope suspended from 2 cliffs. One of the biggest threats in this game is nature as Gabe must defend against wolves and birds, snow falling off cliffs and structures, and falling rocks.</desc>

		<name>Cobra Triangle</name>
		<desc>Cobra Triangle is a single-player boat racing game that lets you do more than just race. It borrows the power-up system from the shoot 'em up genre, but focuses more on manoeuvring than shooting. Since you have a health meter with a dozen bars, it's not that important to dodge bullets unless your health is really low. But you should try not to hit too many walls. To get very far, you have to use your power-ups: TURBO for better acceleration, FIRE for more firepower, SPEED for faster speed, MISSILE to fire both missiles and bullets, and FORCE which lets you fire tons of missiles and also makes you invincible for a limited time. You have about one minute to complete each level. Speaking of which, there are 7 types of levels, each with different objectives. The entire game consists of repeating these types of levels, 25 in total. The later levels are much more difficult than the first ones. They are peppered with extra obstacles like icebergs, more mines, ...</desc>

Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</desc>

		<name>Conflict</name>
		<desc>Conflict is a turn-based, hex-grid wargame for the NES that can be played by one or two players.  It is not a strictly historical wargame in which battles of the past are recreated using real-world geography.  Instead, the two opposing sides (Blue vs. Red) fight it out across 16 imaginary scenarios with armies modeled on NATO and Warsaw Pact forces of the late 1980s. 

The game alternates between two modes of play: a strategic/operational scale, in which players move their units around the hex map; and a tactical combat module for resolving unit-to-unit combats.  In the tactical mode, human players have the choice of either issuing orders themselves or using the "auto" mode which delegates command to the AI.
Splash graphics and text messages convey battle results.

By capturing towns and winning battles, the player gains "fame" points that can be used to purchase more and better military hardware.  Every scenario ends only when the same, single victory condition is achieved by one of the two sides: destroy the opposing side's main battle tank unit in combat.

Winning any one of the first 15 scenarios yields a letter of the alphabet; together, the letters spell out the password that must be entered in order to play the final scenario.</desc>

		<name>Conquest of the Crystal Palace</name>
		<desc>Long ago the Crystal Palace was a thriving kingdom, however the evil war spirit Zaras appeared one day and brought destruction to the lands! The people of the Crystal Palace left as Zaras and his henchman took over, changing the kingdom into a maze of many dangers. You control Farron, the hero of the story who needs to enter the Crystal Palace and destroy the bad guys in order to restore peace. The game is an action platform game that scrolls both horizontally and vertically. On each of five stages you'll need to fight various enemies throughout the varied terrain, and finally defeat the boss at the end. You'll start with just a simple sword, but additional weapons can be found or bought in order to help you out. If you get into trouble, you can also call your dog Zap onto the screen; he'll jump around causing damage to the enemies giving you a chance to escape. You may also come across Kim's shops along your journey. Here you can buy various items, including additional  lives, replenish your health, more powerful weapons, and other useful items. To purchase items, you'll need money which can be collected after defeating enemies in battle.</desc>

		<desc>In this game you play the role of a young gunslinger who travels the land fighting baddies and playing mini games. The main game play involves you moving around the towns horizontally collecting gold by hitting chest whilst at the same time killing the bad guys before they kill you. There is also an RPG element to it where you have to visit people in the towns in order to proceed like at the very beginning where you need to first acquire a knife and you are then able to smash the chest and get money in order to buy a key which in turn allows you to enter the Sheriffs building. Once you are made sheriff you can go to various towns hunting down an outlaw for the bounty money. There are also mini-games such as the shooting range where you have to shoot the bad guy targets whilst avoiding shooting the innocent bystander targets.</desc>

		<name>Crackout</name>
		<desc>In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.

But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.

There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.

Crackout is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.</desc>

		<name>Crystal Mines</name>
		<desc>You control a CM-205 mining robot, your goal is to retrieve "Starla" crystals from various mines on a remote planet. Using the robot you need to locate your quota of crystals while avoiding the many dangers present in the mines, including lava, rock slides, and unfriendly creatures. The robot is equipped with explosives to help reach remote locations in the mine, or destroy any creatures getting in the way (be careful with explosives, you could set off a rock slide and crush the robot!) Once your crystal quota is met, quickly locate the exit and move on to the next, more challenging mine. Crystal Mines is part action and part strategy. There is a time limit to locate the crystals in each mine, plus avoiding falling rocks and monsters will keep you on your toes, but before long you will need to figure out how to locate crystals by properly removing obstructions and navigating tricky mazes.</desc>

		<name>Cyber Stadium Series : Base Wars</name>
		<desc>In the 24th century, the game of Baseball is very different. Tired of paying huge players salaries, the team owners got together one weekend and came up with a bold new idea, Robots. Indeed they renamed their league the Cyber League and stocked it with four robot types; Cyborg, Tank, Floater or Motorcycle, to play.  On an orbital stadium in space, these robots all play a slightly different variation of the baseball rules. Hitting the ball and catching pop-flys and making home runs are all the same, but when the call of a play is in dispute, there are no base referees; the robots engage in a one-on-one battle using any weaponry they're carrying.  Of course to make things interesting, weaponry (and other robot parts and equipment) can only be purchased with team funds during a tournament game, and team funds can only be obtained by wins. Thus the series closer is always sure to be a sold out game.</desc>

		<name>Cyberball</name>
		<desc>After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.

Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.

Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives</desc>

Now you have to fly an experimental spacefighter, the Cybernoid, into battle to recover the asteroids. The Cybernoid is equipped with standard laser blasters, missiles, and the ability to pick up other weapons along the way. 

Cybernoid is an arcade style action game for one player. You can choose from three different skill levels; easy, hard and lethal. On some versions two different sound modes are also available, a basic music and sound effects mode, and a super sound effects mode with no music. Each room you explore is equipped with a time bomb. The bomb will explode taking you with it should you take too long to get past all the obstacles on the screen. You start the game with nine ships, and more can be earned by collecting enough points during the game.</desc>

		<name>Dance Aerobics</name>
		<desc>Dance Aerobics is a chance to get fit by following the movements of an aerobics instructor.

Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4 by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.

The second mode is mini-games called Pad Antics that includes Tune Up, Mat Melodies, and Ditto. Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80 points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song.  Ditto is like a one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every successful position.

The third mode is Aerobics Studios.  Aerobics Studios is the same as the main game but with only 4 levels (Studio 5,  Studio 10, Studio 15, and Studio 20) all unlocked at the start, a score that counts down from 100 with mistakes (or up if the player is doing well), no progression in levels, and the player can continue playing even if there score is at 0.</desc>

		<name>Danny Sullivan's Indy Heat</name>
		<desc>Danny Sullivan, 1988 IndyCar champion and winner of the classic 'Spin &amp; Win' Indianapolis 500 in 1985, put his name to this Super Sprint style racing game. There are 4 cars in each race, 1 or 2 player options, and 9 tracks to race on, with the Tradewest Speed Bowl the ultimate target, and is much longer but with double points (it's essentially a substitute for the licensed-elsewhere Indianapolis 500, which did pay double the usual level of IndyCar championship points for many years).

The player has limited fuel, and will run slowly if supplies run out, and the car can be damaged, although both are repairable in the pits. They get a turbo to use sparingly, which can also be recharged in the pits if they have bought more. After each race the player will get money (slightly more for a higher finish), which can be spent on upgrades such as improved power, brakes or more turbos.</desc>

		<name>Dash Galaxy In The Alien Asylum</name>
		<desc>You are Dash Galaxy, a fearless space explorer. You have just landed on a strange, alien planet thousands of light years from Earth. Your mission is to make your way though the maze of rooms and return safely to your ship. To do this you will need to enter every room and collect all of the objects that can be found in it. Your oxygen supply is limited, though, so be sure to hurry! Throughout this world there are many aliens which will deplete your oxygen even faster if you come into contact with them. Occasionally you will find bombs or keys which can be used to reach previously inaccessable rooms on a floor. The game is played from two points of view; top down when in an elevator shaft, or side scrolling when in one of the many rooms. Some levels contain hidden rooms with many bonuses, or even an express elevator to get you to your destination faster (or it might take you back down a few levels.)</desc>

		<desc>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</desc>

		<name>Death Race</name>
		<desc>Death Race is seemingly inspired by the Sylvester Stallone movie Death Race 2000 released 15 years before this game. The object of the game is to run down innocent pedestrians in your souped-up automotive grim reaper. Progress through the race courses in 8 U.S. cities, moving from west to east starting with San Diego and Phoenix. Each race consists of capturing a flag and finding the exit door, all while squishing or gunning down as many people on foot as possible while avoiding helicopters and heat seeking missiles that are actively trying to discourage this unique hobby. If the time runs out, a barrage of missiles descends on the player's car to indicate that the race is over.

The player has a certain amount of money to begin with and earns more money for completing the races alive. This money can be used to upgrade the engine, steering, tires, chassis, or weapon systems on the car.</desc>

		<name>Deathbots</name>
		<desc>The Mutech Corporation has created their Gamma Base on what used to be Alcatraz Island. Their attempts at creating computer intelligence has backfired, as the AI they've created has taken over the computer systems and is threatening the world! Deep in the fortress is a gamma bomb, and your goal is to penetrate the fortress to destroy the bomb before it can be used. But be careful, for many Deathbots are guarding the maze-like passageways leading to the bomb! 

Gameplay is from an overhead point of view;  you'll need to find your way through the various passageways to reach the gamma bomb (located on the 8th level) and diffuse it. In addition to doorways and walls, transporters can also be found in the maze. These will instantly teleport you to a new location, and on many levels you will need to figure how to use them correctly to get past otherwise dead ends. Different types of Deathbots guard the passages; and you'll need to use the various weapons you find lying about to get past them, before they destroy you. You have a limited amount of energy. Each time you are hit by enemy fire or by a Deathbot, your energy depletes. Lose all of of your energy and a life is lost. And of course, each level ends with a large boss Deathbot. Good luck on your mission!</desc>

The Defender ship is now equipped with an Inviso cloaking device, which renders the ship invulnerable when activated, but has a limited charge. A Stargate will transport the ship to any humanoid in trouble. There are now two special stages, the Firebomber Showdown and the Yllabian Dogfight, that occur every fifth and tenth wave. As in the first game, if all the humans are captured the planet explodes and turns all the landers into mutants.</desc>

		<name>Defender of the Crown</name>
		<desc>Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</desc>

		<name>Déjà Vu</name>
		<desc>Deja Vu was the first game ever made by ICOM, the makers of such famous adventure games as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. 

In Deja Vu your character wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who you are or what you're doing there. To make matters worse, you soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegatable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.

In 1991 a remake of this game was made for Windows 3.x, featuring improved graphics etc.</desc>

		<name>Déjà Vu</name>
		<desc>Deja Vu was the first game ever made by ICOM, the makers of such famous adventure games as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. 

In Deja Vu your character wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who you are or what you're doing there. To make matters worse, you soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegatable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.

In 1991 a remake of this game was made for Windows 3.x, featuring improved graphics etc.</desc>

		<desc>In Demon Sword you play the part of the noble fighter Victar. Victar carries with him a sword which was used long ago to defeat the evil Dark Fiend who took over the land. Now he is back, and Victar must use the sword to defeat him once again.  The game is an arcade style platform game. You begin with just part of the demon sword, and after defeating a large monster at the end of each level an additional section of the sword is restored. After all six missing parts of the sword are found, you can attempt the final level to defeat the Dark Fiend. In addition to the sword pieces, there are other items which can be found during the levels to help out; these include keys to open mystic doors, spheres to restore life, and different types of weapons.</desc>

		<desc>Two centuries ago, an alien species known as the Kojans kidnapped the people of Earth and made them their slaves. But the Earthlings never gave hope of returning to their homeland. So they sent you, a brave space ship pilot, to travel through the galaxy in search of the Earth. But beware, as the Kojans won't let you pass without a fight!

The gameplay is divided into two parts. You begin in the simulation mode, controlling your ship from first-person perspective. You can change your altitude, speed, and weapons, at the same time paying attention to the fuel you have left. Once you have defeated enough enemies and landed on a planet, the game turns into a side-scrolling shooter in which you must navigate your ship through arcade sequences.</desc>

		<name>Destiny of an Emperor</name>
		<desc>A role-playing game for the NES set within the Romance of the Three Kingdoms mythos that has spawned games on nearly every platform imaginable.  A party is formed by selecting up to five officers from a huge pool, many of whom would only join you after be bribed or defeated in combat.  Officers in turn each had a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Si Ma Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).  One of the first games on the NES to attempt to simulate large scale combat between different forces, although obviously in a very limited way.</desc>

		<desc>You play as square-jawed detective Dick Tracy as he tries to solve five different crimes that vary in difficulty. This game is mostly a platform game with some overhead driving to get to the different buildings in search of clues.

There are five different weapons in the game: hand gun, tommy gun, super punch, tear gas and Tracy's plain fists. There are also medical kits that can be found. Enemies can be armed or unarmed. If Tracy shoots an unarmed thug, he loses health.

The main goal of the game is to collect five clues; enough to be able to arrest the culprit. Clues are scattered all over town in various buildings, usually full of Tracy-hating thugs. You start by viewing the mug shots of known criminals, going to there last whereabouts and interrogating them.</desc>

		<name>Die Hard</name>
		<desc>John McClain decides to visit his wife Holly in Nakatomi Plaza, only to discover that she is taken hostage on 30th floor, along with a bunch of other hostages. The main terrorist, Hans, is after the money locked away in a safe on the 30th floor. His hacker, Theo, is slowly breaking the locks into the vault. It's up to McClain to stop them. Die Hard for the Nintendo Entertainment System is a lot different to its other counterparts. The game is played from a top-down perspective, rather than the 1st-/3rd-person perspective.

There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and the task is to clear each floor of terrorists. The stairwell, air duct or the express elevator is used to travel only to Floors 31-35. These are freely accessible at any time, doing away with linearity, and more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). At the start of the game, John can only use his fists to deal with foes, but after bringing down some terrorists, several weapons become available, including the pistol, machine gun, C-4 explosives, rocket launcher, and flash bangs, using their weapons against them. When hit by these terrorists, John loses some life, but it can be restored by collecting soda cans and med-kits. The game ends when all life is lost. 

One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. Also notable is the "foot meter". It starts out full, but will eventually decrease if John steps on shattered glass or runs around at a faster speed. If the meter is empty, he will walk much slower than with a full meter. This may have been added in tune with the film, where the main character John McClain's feet end up in pretty bad shape near the end. Parts of the environments are destructible, most notably vending machines (receive free soda), glass walls and windows. Not all parts of the environment are shown on the screen all the time - a fog of war appears to shroud nearby areas in darkness.

The missions are time limited. There about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened (shown in the status screen), but more time can be gained by destroying the main computer on the fourth level. Once all the locks have been opened, there are only a few minutes to escape. Once this time expires, the game ends.

Like its counterparts, the game features cinematic sequences, which change the story depending on which actions are taken.</desc>

		<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>

		<desc>It is Dig Dug's job to protect 72 different tropical islands from his arch rivals, Pooka and the fire breathing Fygar. Played from an overhead point of view, Dig Dug now has two weapons at his disposal; the first is an air pump and the second is a drill. The pump can be used to inflate and destroy the enemies the same as in the original Dig Dug. At various locations on the islands are stakes, and when the drill is used near a stake a crack will form. If enough cracks become connected that section of the island will fall into the ocean, hopefully taking an enemy (and not Dig Dug!) with it. When all of the Pookas and Fygars have been destroyed, the game moves on to the next, more difficult level.</desc>

		<desc>It is Dig Dug's job to protect 72 different tropical islands from his arch rivals, Pooka and the fire breathing Fygar. Played from an overhead point of view, Dig Dug now has two weapons at his disposal; the first is an air pump and the second is a drill. The pump can be used to inflate and destroy the enemies the same as in the original Dig Dug. At various locations on the islands are stakes, and when the drill is used near a stake a crack will form. If enough cracks become connected that section of the island will fall into the ocean, hopefully taking an enemy (and not Dig Dug!) with it. When all of the Pookas and Fygars have been destroyed, the game moves on to the next, more difficult level.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/20230123-044446 [headered]/Dirty Harry (USA).nes</path>
		<name>Dirty Harry</name>
		<desc>Dirty Harry is based on the popular Clint Eastwood movie character of "Dirty" Harry Callahan (rather than the specific movie "Dirty Harry"), a cop famous for his use of a .44 magnum for doing away with evildoers, and for his catchphrase, "Go ahead, make my day." In fact, the game begins with a digitized sample of that quote. The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited. Further, Dirty Harry has a number of other tools at his disposal, provided he collects them.

This is not a one-way side-scroller, however. There are some adventure elements as well, such as being able to walk through alleys to other streets and going through doors to enter building. Entering buildings provides even greater challenges, like snakes and laser flooring. Dirty Harry even takes the fight down to the sewer.</desc>

		<name>Donkey Kong 3</name>
		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1983, Donkey Kong 3 is the third of the "Donkey Kong" arcade game series, changing the format to more of an action-shooter than a platform game. 

As Stanley the Bugman, players are positioned under Donkey Kong, who has taken over a multi-level greenhouse.  Stanley's goal is to remove Donkey Kong from the greenhouse, but the big ape isn't willing to leave without a fight.

Donkey Kong will agitate two beehives that are close to him to send down a swarm of angry Buzzbees, Beespies and destructive Queen Bees toward Stanley.  These insects, as well as caterpillars which creep down nearby vines are intent on destroying the flowers below Stanley.  Donkey Kong will also send down projectiles himself in an attempt to stop Stanley's attacks.  Stanley must jump between the levels and use his bugspray to repel the insects, and send Donkey Kong into the next area of the greenhouse.

Once Stanley pushes Donkey Kong high enough, a can of super bugspray will become available, allowing a larger shooting radius, and is able to send Donkey Kong up the vines faster.

Once Donkey Kong is sent through the three levels of the greenhouse, Donkey Kong will end up with a beehive on his head, and the levels start all over again.</desc>

		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1983, Donkey Kong 3 is the third of the "Donkey Kong" arcade game series, changing the format to more of an action-shooter than a platform game. 

As Stanley the Bugman, players are positioned under Donkey Kong, who has taken over a multi-level greenhouse.  Stanley's goal is to remove Donkey Kong from the greenhouse, but the big ape isn't willing to leave without a fight.

Donkey Kong will agitate two beehives that are close to him to send down a swarm of angry Buzzbees, Beespies and destructive Queen Bees toward Stanley.  These insects, as well as caterpillars which creep down nearby vines are intent on destroying the flowers below Stanley.  Donkey Kong will also send down projectiles himself in an attempt to stop Stanley's attacks.  Stanley must jump between the levels and use his bugspray to repel the insects, and send Donkey Kong into the next area of the greenhouse.

Once Stanley pushes Donkey Kong high enough, a can of super bugspray will become available, allowing a larger shooting radius, and is able to send Donkey Kong up the vines faster.

Once Donkey Kong is sent through the three levels of the greenhouse, Donkey Kong will end up with a beehive on his head, and the levels start all over again.</desc>

Will you fight back-to-back against waves of baddies in Double Action Blaster Guys? Compete in the ultimate home decoration challenge in RHDE: Furniture Fight? Conclude an interstellar conflict in Solar Wars? Or enter the four-player free-for-all in Super PakPak?
It's not all multiplayer mayhem, though. Face a demon, suffer the horrors of war, challenge a god, or test your NES knowledge in our single-player epics. You can even just kick back and play a few casual rounds in modern-day classics like 2048 and robotfindskitten.</desc>

Like the TV show, the game is basically a trivia game with the added enhancement of being able to answer the question, or take a dare. Dares consist of the Toss-up Challenge, the Physical Challenge, and in the last round, the Obstacle Course. Questions are varied, and in large enough number to avoid excessive repetition even over several games worth of play.</desc>

		<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon II : The Revenge</name>
		<desc>The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of the Black Warriors gang by Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee in the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time.

The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade.

The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire.

The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and "River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon III : The Sacred Stones</name>
		<desc>The final game in the trilogy.

Billy and Jimmy Lee are returning from martial arts training when their paths cross a fortune teller. She tells them of a great evil in Egypt, their strongest adversary yet, and how the Rosetta Stones can aid them.

This game features weapon shops where Billy and Jimmy can buy power-ups, tricks, energy and extra lives to aid them in 
their quest.

Power-ups make Billy and Jimmy twice their size, increasing their damage done and range of attack.

The character graphics have changed, moving away from cartoon style graphics to more realistic looking characters.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the arcade game, Double Dribble is a basketball action game for one or two players. You can select different time limits for games, select teams, and begin playing! Gameplay is entirely action, so no time needs to be spent customizing the teams or with statistics. You control each player on the team one at a time (the player with or about to receive the ball will be human controlled, with the computer taking over the other players temporarily.) Some versions feature a small amount of digitized sound effects, and close ups of slam dunks.</desc>

		<name>Dr. Chaos</name>
		<desc>Dr. Chaos was your typical mad scientist. He owned an extensive mansion and spent his time experimenting within it on things that mankind was never meant to know. His latest invention is an Interdimensional Warpgate which allows access to worlds beyond our own. As the doctor's younger brother, Michael, you arrive at Dr.Chaos' mansion one day to find the place crawling with strange mutant creatures. To make matters worse, the mansion itself isn't looking too good. Strange "holes" into other dimensions have opened up and made a mess of the architecture. Furthermore, Dr.Chaos himself is missing.

The game takes place as a platform game where you must use various weapons (knife, pistol, machine pistol or grenade) to fight your way past mutants and into various rooms of the mansion. Once in these rooms, the view changes to a first person maze...  and you'll need to open various cabinets, doors and hit walls in special places to find access into a dimensional hole. Once you enter the dimensional hole, the game once again becomes a platform game, where you will need to fight your way to the end of the level and defeat a boss monster of some sort to obtain a piece of the Warpgate. Then you'll have to proceed BACK through the level and return to the mansion, where you'll explore to find the next dimensional hole.</desc>

		<name>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</name>
		<desc>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is based on the Robert Louis Stevenson novella "Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", which follows a respected doctor who develops a serum that transforms him into the embodiment of his darkest thought and desires. He becomes a slave to his alter ego and is ultimately destroyed by it. 

In the game, Jekyll must make his way from his home to the church where he is to marry his sweetheart Miss Millicent. He's got to keep his life bar and "Jekyll to Hyde" meter in check, or he'll find himself changed into the nefarious Mr. Hyde. If this happens, Hyde must then defeat enough baddies to raise the meter back up and allow the good doctor to continue his quest.</desc>

		<desc>An unreleased video game developed by Mark Lesser and Rex Bradford of Microsmiths that was produced for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game featured the sponsorship of the Reebok Pump shoe.

In the game the player controlled the infamous Count Dracula who, while wearing Reebok Pumps, had to first work his way down his castle while avoiding the hostile villagers. This could be accomplished by hypnotizing the villagers with your vampiric gaze, or by pulling a lever to spring one of many Rube Goldberg-esque hidden traps.</desc>

		<desc>"Dragon Buster" is a conversion of Namco's arcade game from 1984. The game is composed of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. Your goal in every level is to reach the final stage where you face the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, you move through the platform-like stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since you can't heal your character between the stages.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to the arcade game "Dragon Buster" has the following background story: you are a young archer Carl, who has to retrieve an ancient artifact in order to liberate the world from the domination of demons and dragons. 

Unlike the first game, you are not restricted to a platform here, but can move freely to any direction. You have to go through the maze-like dungeons, find a key, and then get to the exit. After that, the dungeon disappears and makes it possible for you to progress to the next one. You fight enemies with your bow. You have a limited supply of arrows, but you can find quivers among other items in the dungeons.</desc>

		<desc>In Dragon Fighter the protagonist is a fighter who can turn into a dragon. In this side-scrolling action game the hero can walk, jump, and slash with his sword. He can also charge his sword to fire a magical projectile. The real power-up, however, is that he can transform into a flying dragon. When this happens, the game turns into a shmup-style game in which the scrolling moves at a constant rate and the dragon can shoot fireballs in a spread formation. Transforming into a dragon is restricted by a power meter.

The game features six levels of action-- a snow level, a cave level, a water level, an industrial level, and a haunted castle level. The sixth and final level is fought entirely as a dragon with unlimited flight capability.</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Power is an action-adventure game developed and published by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System on March 3, 1988. It is a heavily localized version of the Japanese game Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo (translated to Dragon Ball: Mystery of the Dragon God), originally released on November 27, 1986. Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).</desc>

		<name>Dragon Warrior</name>
		<desc>Dragon Warrior is the first famous console RPG. You assume the role of a descendant of Erdrick, a brave warrior of the past. Once upon a time, Erdrick defeated the evil Dragonlord with the help of the Ball of Light. Now, Dragonlord stole the Ball of Light, and your mission is to recover it and to restore peace in the world.

In Dragon Warrior, you move your character around in a top-down world. In cities and palaces you can talk to people, rest in inns and buy stuff in shops. There's a variety of weapons, equipment and armor to buy. 

When wandering around in the wilderness, you occasionally encounter enemies, and fight them from 1st person perspective. Combat is turn based: you select menu options while fighting - you can attack with your weapon, cast a spell (using up some of your magic energy), use and item or try to run. Killing monsters gives you experience, and, as is typical for RPGs, you level up and improve your stats when you gain enough experience. 

Like in later RPGs, you have limited hit points, lose them when you are attacked by enemies, and die when you run out of them. When your character dies in a battle, he is automatically restored in a nearby town.</desc>

Unlike the first game, Dragon Warrior II allows the player to join forces with two other characters, a magic-using princess and a wizard-warrior prince. Also including expanded monster battles involving up to 6 creatures and a much larger world, Dragon Warrior II is an important step in the evolution of the Dragon Warrior series.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Warrior III</name>
		<desc>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.

Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. 

You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.

The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Warrior IV</name>
		<desc>Dragon Warrior 4, the fourth volume in the Dragon Warrior series (and the last on the NES), once again took the elements of the previous games and expanded them into a five chapter saga of epic proportions.
  The first four chapters are played from the viewpoint of one character per chapter, who will all meet up in the fifth chapter.  From a soldier to a merchant, the game weaves an intriguing story that ties all four characters together in the end.
  Also new in Dragon Warrior 4 is the introduction of battle tactics where the lineup of the characters is important to how much damage they deal.  The player is even given the opportunity to swap a character from reserve into the battle to add a whole new depth of strategy.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Wars</name>
		<desc>Dragon Wars takes place in the magical land of Dilmun, an island of salvation perverted into a world of horror by Namtar (as you might expect - the bad guy).

The player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with nothing more than.. well - nothing. Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). 
Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out).

Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based.

Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities.
Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.</desc>

		<name>Dragon's Lair</name>
		<desc>The NES version for Dragon's Lair brings Dirk the Daring in a side-scrolling game, different from the interactive movie gameplay common to the other games under the same license.

Once again, Dirk is up to rescue Princess Daphne from the evil dragon Singe. To do so, Dirk will use weapons such knifes, axes, fire balls, etc, thrown against dragons, bats, snakes, the Lizard King (who will steal gold from him), among other foes. He will also do a lot of jumping and ducking to avoid threats along his way, such as falling bridges, presses, spikes and holes on the floor. To complete a stage, all he has to do is to get to the end of it alive.

At the end of some stages, Dirk will take an elevator that will lead him to other stages. The elevator makes short stops at some platforms, and you have to decide if Dirk will jump onto that platform or another. If  he takes the wrong platform, he may go back to a previous stage and go through it all over again. From the elevator Dirk can also get to a bonus level, the Lizard King's throne room, where he can try to recover the gold the King has stolen from him.

Although Dirk has a life bar, he will instantly die if takes damage from the most of the threats. He also has a "candle bar", which is used (by pressing the start button) to light up dark places and to discover hidden items at specific locations.

The game can be played by 2 players taking turns. The PAL version has faster gameplay, additional enemies (including level bosses), death animations and splash screens in between the levels.</desc>

		<name>Duck Hunt</name>
		<desc>Duck Hunt is a shooting simulation where the player goes out with his faithful dogs to hunt ducks. It requires the use of the Zapper light gun. In game modes A and B, players view a swampland from a first-person perspective. The dog scares ducks (one or two at a time) out of the swamp, and they go flying around in the air. The player has three shots and a limited amount of time to shoot the ducks before they fly away. Each round only allows a limited number of misses in order to move on successfully. As the rounds progress, the ducks begin flying faster and faster, and fewer misses are allowed.

Mode C features target practice on clay pigeons rather than ducks. The perspective and rules here are the same, with only three shots to destroy two clay pigeons before they disappear off the horizon. Destroy enough clay pigeons to move on to the next, tougher round.</desc>

		<desc>Duck Tales for NES is a traditional platform game in which the player takes the role of greedy Scrooge McDuck in search of treasures around the globe. He counts on his three nephews and on other Duck Tales characters to help him in his quest through inospit places such as the Amazononic forest, the African Mines, the Himalayas, Transylvania (where he meets Dracula Duck) and even the Moon.

Each one of them reserves the old duck lots of adventure, different enemies and hidden rooms.

The game features a 2D side-scrolling platform gameplay very similar to Mega Man. Graphics are colorful and cartoonish, music remembers players of the TV series and controls are very simple.</desc>

These dudes being referred to are emoticon looking characters who go by the names of Dude, Happy, Patch, Bozo, Babe and Foxy. In this puzzle game, you control one of the dudes as they bounce back and forth across the screen trying to acquire the jewels on the playfield. The one caveat is that your dude has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, you have to bounce across a paint can (an attitude converter) that will change your dude to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time. This is an unlicensed game.</desc>

		<desc>The evil sorcerer Darces took over our world once again. The only way to defeat him is to find five elemental swords and to combine them into the ultimate weapon which is the only possibility to destroy the villain. Naturally, you, the nameless hero, are the one who is chosen to go on this dangerous journey. 

"Dungeon Magic" is a first-person RPG that looks similar to  Wizardry games, but instead of the usual turn-based combat you fight your enemies in real time, parrying to avoid their blows and attacking physically or casting offensive magic to hurt them. You explore large outdoor areas, towns, and dungeons, and specialize in five kinds of magic.</desc>

		<desc>All weekend ballplayers know softball's no joke, but that doesn't mean you can't have a little fun with it. And when you step up to the plate in this cart you'll find the wackiest bunch of players to ever hit a softball diamond!

Play seven inning fast or slow-pitch games. In One Player mode, you face the computer in a five-game elimination tournament. Win them all, and you earn the right to challenge the awesome Amazons - All-Star Softball's all-time championship team. Of course, you and a friend can play each other in a head-to-head contest.

There are no preset ball clubs so you recruit 10-member squad from a roster of 60 weird players. Look for players who have strong basic baseball skills such as arm strength and speed. But to win on some of the tricky fields you'll also need players with more unusual skills - such as climbing fences, diving into water, and flying at night

In fast pitch, you hurl that baby in three speeds. But stay alert, base runners steal and batters bunt. In slow pitch, you can lob the ball short or long. You can also make your pitches curve right or left.Fielding the ball takes practice, but your guys can also dive for hard grounders and leap up to snare line shots. For quick double plays, infielders can tag a base then throw the ball.

With six softball fields to choose from, including the Sandlot, the Cliff, and a Professional field, there's some great action. Get ready to take yourself out to the softball park.</desc>

		<name>Dynowarz : Destruction of Spondylus</name>
		<desc>This is a game of combat between giant mechanized dinosaurs named robosaurs in a faraway solar system named Spondylus. Mad robosaurs have overrun the planets of this man-made solar system and it is up to Professor Proteus to take the controls of the #1 robosaur, the Cyborasaurus. The goal is to get to the center of all 7 planets in this solar system and disable the artificially intelligent life support systems, which are guarded by progressively tougher defense.

Gameplay consists of getting into your robosaur, tromping across the surface of desolate planets in the solar system, fighting meaner robosaurs, and equipping better weapons along the way (you can launch your dino's fist!). Once you make it to the middle of each planet, you eject from the Cyborasaurus and head to the life support computer. Destroy the computer and get out fast.</desc>

		<name>Eliminator Boat Duel</name>
		<desc>Eliminator Boat Duel is a ruthless one on one boat racing game that can either be played against the computer or a human opponent. The races take place in such settings as open water, the bayou, and even industrial water districts. Each boat race consists of several sections. First, there is the starting line -- where you can expect a $2000 fine for a false start -- which begins with a brief side-scrolling race with split-screen background scrolling, a common characteristic of later NES titles. The primary sections of the races are a mixture of top-down racing and 3rd-person racing from a perspective behind the boats. The top-down sections are the most involved with numerous threats to avoid such as alligators, sharks, and whirlpools that will turn you the wrong way. There are also ramps to jump off of, people in need of rescue, nitro speed boost powerups, and raw cash bonuses to collect. The 3rd person segments have less detail and distraction but move much quicker as the 2 players vie to stay within the flags, collect speed boosts, and hit the occasional ramp. Speed boosts are collected along the way and can be used at the player's discretion to gain a much-needed edge at any point during the race.

A race finishes back in the side-scrolling view. If the boats come through too close together, the bikini models on the sidelines act confused and request a slo-mo replay, which the game subsequently provides. Prize money is then awarded with which the players may use to repair and upgrade their boats with faster engines, tougher hulls, and better steering.</desc>

		<name>Eskimo Bob Starring Alfonzo</name>
		<desc>Eskimo Bob: Starring Alfonzo is a side-scrolling adventure puzzle platformer based on the early 2000s Flash cartoon of the same name. You control either Eskimo Bob or Alfonzo as they try to find their friend Seal, who has gone missing, across a total of 64 levels.

Eskimo Bob or Alfonzo must collect every fish on the stage to proceed to the next area. Both of them have different abilities: Eskimo Bob can punch the ground to destroy blocks or attack the boss, while Alfonzo can use his stick to poke enemies and destroy blocks in front of him. They are helped by Walrus (who can help them reach higher areas after you poke him) and Fish In A Spaceship (who carries them across long distances.) You can switch between them in some levels where their abilities are required in different situations to get past specific obstacles.

Every stage is filled with various antagonists from the series, including Maurice The Pigeon, Yeti, Sams, Penguin, Flying Nose, and Yuck. They have to be avoided or defeated using each character's specific attacks. Each level has its own environmental hazards, including slippery ice sheets, breakable blocks, and bottomless pits. You'll also face a boss every 16 levels.</desc>

		<name>Exodus : Journey To The Promised Land</name>
		<desc>In Exodus you need to guide Moses through 100 different levels in order to reach the promised land. The gameplay features an action/strategy part similar to Boulder Dash, and a question part. In the action part, you need to collect five question marks and enough Manna to open the exit of the maze-like screens. There are a variety of boulders, walls, dirt, and other obstacles in the way. Some obstacles can be destroyed when moses uses his staff to say the word of god, other obstacles can be pushed out of the way, and some you must find a way around. You need to be careful when navigating around the screens, if you cause any boulders to fall and they land on you a life is lost. Also wandering about are a variety of enemies which can be destroyed or avoided, but will cost you one life if you get caught. When you find all the question marks and manna you need, the exit appears and you can move on to the question phase.</desc>

		<name>F-117A : Stealth Fighter</name>
		<desc>F-117A Stealth Fighter is a flight simulator where the player is in the cockpit of the game's eponymous jet fighter. The game revolves around flying solo punitive strike missions against various rogue nations. For example, the first mission has the player launching from a base in Sicily to strike targets in Libya. Watch out for enemy jets, of course. The 8-bit NES's input capabilities are a bit limited so this flight simulator depends on many button combinations in order to carry out various complicated actions.</desc>

		<name>Family Picross</name>
		<desc>Family Picross is a homebrew picross puzzle game. It keeps the classic puzzle game formula using the numbers on top and to the left of each row and column to fill in the boxes. The player controls the cursor directly and moves over the boxes. A single button is used to toggle between the three box states: selected, crossed out or open.

There are more than 100 puzzles to complete, starting from very small puzzles to large and complex ones. Options including entering a name, a selection between three music tracks, stopping the cursor at the edges or allowing it to wrap around, and the ability to continue using a password. A password is provided after completing each puzzle. The game also keeps track of the high scores as puzzles have a time limit. Completing puzzles in a short time provides more points. It is possible to continue playing and complete the puzzle even when time has run out, but that costs one of the three lives provided.

The game is available as a ROM download and a successful Kickstarter campaign was launched to provide a cartridge version in three varieties: box, loose cartridge and a solutionist version with a solutions guide to all puzzles.</desc>

		<name>Faria : A World of Mystery &amp; Danger!</name>
		<desc>It was a stormy night. Cold wind raged, and rain poured over the country. The wise men understood at once: the prophecy has become reality. The spell of the Legendary Sword was lifted...

Fast-forward to three months later. You are a nameless young adventurer, looking for some action. Your first task is... you guessed it, to rescue a princess. After the king gives you this assignment, you are free to roam about the world, visiting dangerous caves and towers, and fulfilling ancient prophecies..

"Faria" is a combination of console-style RPG exploration and character development (like in  Final Fantasy or  Dragon Quest) with real-time battles. On the world map, you are randomly attacked by enemies, and have to eliminate them running around the battle field and attacking them physically or casting spells. In the complex, maze-like towers the enemies appear everywhere. There is also a good deal of puzzles to solve in the dungeons.</desc>

		<name>Faxanadu</name>
		<desc>This 2D platformer has elements of role-playing and adventure in addition to side-scrolling action.

The story is a classic one of good versus evil.  Disaster strikes the once peaceful Elf town of Eolis. The sky rains meteorites upon the World Tree - wild animals and evil monsters terrorize the citizens - the water supply from the wells is dwindling - plants are withering - people are dying. Only you can restore peace to the land by conquering the Evil One, who lives in the Evil Place.

There are many places you must visit during your quest including the medieval town, where you begin, country villages, fortresses, caves, and gloomy bogs - each with its own ambiance and musical score.  You will be talking with the villagers, collecting gold to buy weapons, armor and other objects, jumping over obstacles and using items.  Attack zombies, dwarves, giant snakes, wyverns, evil gnomes, or one-eyed one-footed things with a large collection of swords and daggers or zap them with a magic spell. 

As areas are completed by defeating enemies, your character rises up in “levels” and achieves a new “rank” which is tied directly to the restore password (called a “mantra” in the game). The higher your “rank”, the more gold you start out with.  Saving a game can only be done in a shrine or temple with a priest.  This is also where you are transported when you restart the game - or if you die.</desc>

		<name>Felix the Cat</name>
		<desc>Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous cartoon character.

The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix' magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. 

There are four different types of levels. 

1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons.

Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin.

Levels that take place entirely under water.

Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella.

Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.

The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</desc>

		<desc>The player takes the role of a Ferrari team driver who's objective is to become an F1 Champion during the standard 16 round season. The player competes against 25 computer opponents representing different F1 teams. Every round consists of a qualification race (1 lap) and a main race (5 laps). The qualification race determines where the players vehicle will be placed at the beginning of the main race. The player is rewarded points which determine their standings at the end of a main race with more points being given for the higher position finished in the race. Also during a race, the player can make a pit stop to change their worn down tires and to refuel, which involves playing a minigame. There is also a practice mode, where the player can choose the number of practice laps they wish to practice.</desc>

		<name>Fester's Quest</name>
		<desc>Uncle Fester was out one night, moonbathing in the yard of the Addams Family property one day when suddenly, out of the sky, a UFO descended and started beaming alien creatures to the planet. Grabbing his gun, Fester sets off to stop the aliens and slay their boss creatures, encountering other Addams Family members along the way who will aid him.

Fester's Quest is an overhead-view game in which Uncle Fester uses his gun, or later, a whip to attack enemies near him. Enemies drop money and power-ups. The money can be used at Hot Dog stands to replenish health. A variety of items can be collected, each with a different effect. Fester and the rest of the Addams family are based on their characters from the popular 1960s TV show (this game was made before the remakes in  both series and movie form).</desc>

		<name>Fire 'n Ice</name>
		<desc>The peaceful island Coolmint is attacked by flame monsters sent by the evil wizard Druidle. The queen of the winter fairies chooses the novice wizard Dana to drive back the monsters.

Fire 'n Ice is a puzzle game seen from a side-view perspective. The goal in each level is to extinguish all flames by pushing or dropping blocks onto them. The player takes control of Dana who can create or destroy ice blocks, climb blocks and push loose blocks. Ice is created diagonally below Dana in the direction that he is facing, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed. However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a flame, so that the player will often have to find a way to create ice blocks next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning it can't be moved and won't fall down. It is therefor also possible to create ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used to extinguish flames, but they are indestructible and only move one space when pushed (unless they are on an icy surface).</desc>

		<name>Fisher-price : Firehouse Rescue</name>
		<desc>In Fisher-Price: Firehouse Rescue, the player controls a fireman driving a firetruck. Both the fireman and the firetruck bear the familiar style of the popular Fisher-Price toy line. The object of the game is to rescue pets from trees and people from houses in the immediate neighborhood. There are 2 parts to this task: the first part involves navigating the maze-like streets from an overhead perspective in order to find the troubled residence. Once the house is reached, the second part of the job is to maneuver the firetruck's ladder underneath the person or animal in need of rescue, from a side perspective, and letting them down to safety.

While the first level confines the entire neighborhood to a one-screen maze, later levels span multiple screens, thereby increasing the challenge. Further, later levels also add time limits and additional keys that the player must collect before attempting the rescue mission.</desc>

		<name>Fisher-Price : I Can Remember</name>
		<desc>Fisher-Price: I Can Remember is a card-based game of memory transposed onto the NES. The object is to flip over pairs of cards and find pairs that match. If an unmatched pair is flipped then they get flipped back and the player must remember that data for their next turn. The game has 3 levels, with each having progressively more cards (12, 16, or 20). The cards contain pictures of Fisher-Price toys. Finding matches removes the cards from the screen which then reveals parts of a larger Fisher-Price item.

The game allows a player to play alone, or it allows 2-player competitive play. Further, it also allows human vs. computer competition, where the computer player is named "Electro".</desc>

In earlier levels, this is just a matter of moving the shape around the screen. In later levels, the player must also flip the shape vertically, horizontally, or both, before it forms the perfect fit for one of the silhouettes. The games can be played against the clock. There is also 2-player alternating play, where 2 human players can compete, or a human player can square off against the computer player (named "Electro").</desc>

		<desc>This is a platform "beat-'em-up" game based on the animé series Hokuto no Ken. According to the story mentioned in the manual, Kenshirou, the main character, has to save the people from the evil Emperor Heaven. The game itself, however, features no story whatsoever, but a lot of platform action instead. You have to run quickly through the levels (there is a time limit), punching and kicking your enemies, causing them to fly away or to explode, occasionally meeting a boss, visiting secret areas behind doors and collecting various power-ups. 

This is in fact the second game in the series; the first one was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<desc>In this puzzle game, you control Flappy, a yellow mole.  The object of the game is to help Flappy push the Blue Stone onto its Blue Platform in each level.

Red Stones are placed in key locations across the levels.  They can be pushed, stacked on top of each other, and even destroyed.  Flappy must strategically take advantage of the gravity and the Red Stones in order to clear the path for pushing the Blue Stone.  Three different types of enemies will try to prevent Flappy from clearing the level, so you must either avoid the enemies, crush them from above with the Stones, or pick up Sleeping Mushrooms to knock them out temporarily.</desc>

		<name>The Flintstones : The Rescue of Dino &amp; Hoppy</name>
		<desc>The Flintstones and the Rubbles were enjoying a fine day when suddenly, someone from the future called Dr. Butler arrived and stole their pets, Dino and Hoppy!  Butler plans to feature the pets in his intergalactic zoo, and what's worse, he's destroyed the Great Gazoo's time machine so that no-one could stop him!  It's up to everyone's favourite caveman, Fred Flintstone, to find the pieces to the time machine and repair it, so that they can travel to the future and confront Dr. Butler once and for all!

The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino &amp; Hoppy is a side-scrolling platformer for the NES.  In it, you control Fred Flintstone through various locations such as Bedrock, Reef Rock, the Jungle and more as he searches for the missing pieces of Gazoo's time machine.  Fred has his trusty club which he can use to attack with, or charge up it's power by holding B for a more deadly attack.  Fred can collect coins after defeating enemies, which are used to pay for secondary weapons like slingshots and tomahawks, as well as special abilities such as flying and diving.

After completing the first level, the player is presented with an overworld map that allows you to choose which level you'd like to go to.  There are also basketball courts on the map - if you beat your opponent in a game of basketball, you can earn one of the special abilities which are required for use later.</desc>

		<name>The Flintstones : The Surprise at Dinosaur Peak</name>
		<desc>Fred and Barney are searching for their children, Pebbles and Bam-Bam who got lost. When they finally find them, a volcanic eruption blocks their way and so they start going all the way around the mountain to find out why this happened and of course to save their children. 

The Surprise at Dinosaur Peak is the second Flintstones-licensed game for the NES. There are two characters you can play with. By pressing the Select button you can change from Fred to Barney and vice versa. Each character has unique abilities that are needed to complete certain parts of each stage. For example Fred can grab the edges of a roof or a hill and climb while Barney can hang from ropes and vines. In terms of weapons Fred has a bat which is stronger and can also be charged for extra power but it takes more time to use. Barney on the other hand has a slingshot and can shoot small rocks for ranged attacks but rather weak. There are also weapons like throwing axes and bowling balls that both can use.</desc>

		<desc>The game is about a team of superheroes called the Flying Warriors who have to fight a demon before he can take over the world with his armies of Tusk Soldiers. You start off with kung fu master Rick Stalker, but eventually get the help of Hayato Go, Mary Lynn, Greg Cummings and Jimmy Cutler. During the side scrolling portion of the game you can use your kung fu and mystic spells to dispose of enemies. Each enemy you defeat gives you experience points which will eventually increase your life points. There are some one on one duels during fighting tournaments that involve hitting a target on your opponents body while defending the target on your own body. There is also RPG-style command battles against bosses.

There is also a tournament mode, where up to 8 players can compete to win the championship. You can choose your characters fighting style from six different choices; kung fu, boxing, karate, wrestling, kick boxing, and martial arts.</desc>

		<name>Formula One : Built to Win</name>
		<desc>Formula One: Born To Win is a career racing game. The player begins with a Mini Cooper and claws up the ranks of the racing circuit starting with the lowest ranked races in the eastern part of the United States. By winning races, the player can upgrade parts on the Mini and have a better shot at more races. Win enough races and eventually earn the opportunity to race using faster cars. The other cars available in the game are the Vector W2, Ferrari F40, and of course, the Formula 1. The first races take place in New York City, Detroit, and Miami.

		<name>Friday the 13th</name>
		<desc>Based on the popular movie franchise, Friday the 13th casts you as one of six camp counselors (three girls or three boys) at the infamous Camp Crystal Lake, and you are tasked with destroying Jason Voorhees once and for all.

To get to Jason, you must run around a camp, killing zombie ghouls and collecting weapons, until you hear an alarm sound.  When that alarm goes off, it means Jason has entered a cabin and you must find him.

To save time, you can switch between all six counselors, depending on where you are.  Once you enter the house that Jason is in, the game switches to a 3D-esque maze in which you have to hurt Jason with the items you collected.  Once he's been damaged enough, he'll run away, only to sound another alarm later and enter another house.</desc>

From the deepest trenches of the ocean, the Kraken has come to lay waste to your city!

The archers have slung every arrow.
The burning tar has run dry.
Every piece of military weaponry has been dispatch.

And yet... the Kraken moves forward, climbing the towering walls of your seaside fortress.

With no ammunition left, the city itself moves from a barricade, to a weapon!</desc>

		<name>Fun House</name>
		<desc>Fun House is based on a children's television game show of the same name.

The basic premise of the game is to get through the 72 rooms of the Fun House. The object of each room is to throw tomatoes at the targets littered throughout the room before time expires. Sometimes these targets are numbered, so they have to be hit in numerical order. After all targets are hit, a key will appear allowing the player to move on to the next room. 

This may appear simple, but the player's character is on rollerblades, thus making navigating not such a simple task. There are also blobs, boingers, the banana launcher, and the spray gun which will either try to hinder progress or take away time if the player gets hit by them. The player also has to deal with various terrain obstacles in each room such as slime covered ramps or icy floors.

The player starts with three lives, but can earn more by collecting 25 silver coins. There are also gold coins with each one equaling 5 silver coins.

Other helpful items the player can collect are glop clocks, with the small ones adding 8 seconds, and the large ones adding 15 seconds to the game clock. There are also sneakers which will temporarily increase the player's speed. There are also starbursts, which increase the players score and warp cubes, which will send the player to another part of the Fun House.</desc>

		<name>G.I. Joe : A Real American Hero</name>
		<desc>G.I Joe is a side-scrolling action game where you can select 3 out of a possible 5 characters to complete a mission. 

Each level is in three main parts:  The fight into the mission zone, the mission zone, and the escape from the mission zone.  The stages where you fight into and escape from the mission zone are straightforward action – just fight your way to the end of the stage, and defeat the stage boss.

The actual mission zone is a maze, where the object is to place bombs at pre-determined locations, then find and use the exit.  The mazes start out easy with the first one being only two screens high and 4 long.  Level 6 is 7 by 8 for a total of 56 screens.

Characters:

Duke (Tiger Force first sergeant/squad leader), Rock &amp; Roll (gatling gunner), Capt. Grid-Iron (hand-to-hand combat specialist), Blizzard (arctic attack soldier), Snake Eyes (commando)</desc>

		<desc>Your starship is alive! A metamorphic creature that can transform from a huge flying insect into a metallic destroyer. Face squadron after squadron of alien fighters, marching ever onward towards a final confrontation with an all-powerful enemy.

This is basically a scrolling, shoot-it-if-it-moves, action game. As your ship scrolls up the screen, you fire on ships coming from the top of the screen. Occasionally, after ships have been destroyed, you can pick up a power up to increase you firing ability. At the end of each level is a boss you must defeat to move onward.</desc>

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</desc>

		<desc>Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</desc>

		<name>Galaxy 5000 : Racing in the 51st Century</name>
		<desc>Galaxy 5000 is an isometric-perspective space racing game where 4 spaceships compete head to head in outer space races. 1 or 2 human players can compete in the races; the rest of the ships are controlled by the computer. The ships complete several laps around each course and have limited firing capacity to throw their opponents off balance. The ships can also jump. In fact, the ships can jump right off the edge of the course and drop down (in space). If the player does not complete a course in good time, the entire race track will disintegrate and leave the ship to fall down (and apparently splash into some water below).

A notable item about this game is its use of squeaky, comical, digitized voices for exclamations when colliding with another player ("Hey!", "Excuse me!", "Watch it!"). There are also 2 completely different control schemes that a player can adopt for cruising around the course. The first scheme rotates and drives the ship in the direction that the control pad is being pressed. The second scheme uses left and right to rotate the ship and up to thrust in the direction the nose is pointing.</desc>

		<name>Galf</name>
		<desc>Galf is a retro throwback golf game that was originally part of the 2017 golf game Golf Story. It was released standalone as a fully functional NES cartridge in 2018. The game consists of nine holes and controls very similarly to Golf on the NES. The holes feature a variety of typical golf course traps and hazards. The position of your ball, what type of grass you're hitting it out of, and the current wind speed all affect your ball's power and accuracy.

As an additional bonus to the physical release, there is now a two-player mode, where each player takes their entire turn finishing the hole before the other player is allowed to tee off.</desc>

		<desc>Gaplus is a sequel to Galaga and has similar gameplay. The player controls a spaceship, that can now move vertically (limited to halfway up the screen, much like Atari's Centipede) as well as horizontally, and shoots at swarms of incoming insect-like aliens which fly in formation above it and swoop down to attack it in a kamikaze-like dive. In this sequel, the level starts over if the player gets killed before all the enemies have come in. When all enemies are killed, the player moves on to the next level.

The official NES port of the arcade game was released in 2020 as a bonus game in Namco Museum Archives Vol. 2.</desc>

		<desc>The Ghoul realm is under attack by a mysterious force and aspiring warrior Firebrand sets out to save it.

As in its predecessor, gameplay in Gargoyle's Quest II is divided into an adventure and an action part. During the adventure parts, Firebrand explores a world map and several villages from a top-down perspective, talking to his fellow ghouls and zombies to advance the story or receive important items. Action parts are seen from a side-scrolling perspective. In these parts of the game, Firebrand has the ability to jump, cling to walls, fly for a limited amount of time and shoot fireballs at his enemies. As the game progresses, Firebrand becomes more and more powerful, receiving items that improve his agility, armor or attack power.</desc>

		<name>Garry Kitchen's BattleTank</name>
		<desc>Battletank is an advanced tank simulator where players take control of a tank from its driver's seat. Players are stuck straight in the tank and sent off to the battlefield in order to accomplish the mission they are assigned to.  

Mission objectives.can be anything from eliminating the enemies to destroying the enemy fuel dump to taking out an enemy camp.  However dangerous enemies lurk all over the battlefield.  Helicopters, minefields and other tanks wait to block your moves.  These enemies can move off-screen and strafe around the tank, leading to difficulties.  

However, many strategic elements are involved.  The first-person mode offers a limited view of the battlefield, and if players push the tank into overdrive it can miss the target and rush into a nest of tanks or a minefield.  Turret angle, ammunition, and tank fuel remaining must all be taken into account by the player.  To add to this, certain guns on the tank (there's 4 of them) will only hurt certain enemies.  But don't expect any help here!  Six hits and your tank is cooked!</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet</name>
		<desc>Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.</desc>

Six magicians, each trapped inside a magical gem, are liberated from the crown Gemfire by Princess Robyn, daughter of the tyrannical ruler of Ishmeria, King Eselred.  Fleeing across the length and breadth of the island nation, they each choose a leader from the greatest noble houses as their champion to topple Eselred and bring peace to Ishmeria. 

Players select one of these noblemen and seek to unite all the provinces under their banner through a combination of warfare and diplomacy.</desc>

		<name>George Foreman's KO Boxing</name>
		<desc>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.

Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.

By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.

All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</desc>

		<name>Get'em Gary</name>
		<desc>Get'em Gary is a prequel to Handy Harvy and it was created during the development of that game. It draws inspiration from titles like Donkey Kong and Wrecking Crew, but also Fix It Felix Jr. from the Disney movie Wreck-it Ralph.

The local neighbourhood punk Rusty is destroying the windows of the Westspring Manor apartment building with firecrackers and bombs. Gary is the building's property manager. He has to fix Rusty's mess by repairing windows and closing their shutters.

The game consists of several fixed, single screens. Gary starts at the bottom and needs to fix and close all broken windows to win the section and move on to a higher part in the next screen. This continues until the roof of the building is reached and Rusty is defeated.

Gary only has 60 seconds to win a screen. There are multiple ledges and he can also only climb up when there is a gutter and sometimes there are plants and crates that block the way. In the meantime Rusty moves about on the highest ledge and constantly drops bombs, bowling balls and game consoles that hurt Gary and take away one of his two starting lives. The level is won only when all broken windows are repaired and the shutters are closed before time runs out. Rusty can break windows again with his bombs that a little time to detonate.

Every now and then a turbo burger appears as a bonus item. It needs to be picked up quickly before it disappears. It grants a brief period of invincibility and provides double points for each shutter closed.

The Windows version is identical and uses GGvm, a virtual machine for NES games written in JAVA.</desc>

The legend of the White Lion tells that one day, a Lion attacked and ravaged the village. The lion was wounded by the spear of a brave soldier and disappeared in a cave. One day, the parents of a young girl named Maria, decided to go and solve the mystery of the White Lion, leaving her alone. They never returned. While searching for her parents, Maria falls into a river and wakes up in a fantasy world.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.

As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

		<desc>Ghostbusters II is a single-player side-scrolling game. Generally, the player controls a ghostbuster as he explores levels based on the film. The character's goal is to make his way to the museum before time runs out. Two levels involve riding around in the heroes' famous car. In another level the player controls the Statue of Liberty, shooting fireballs. The ghostbuster character is armed with unlimited supplies of slime that can be shot out of a cannon and ghost traps.</desc>

		<desc>Ghosts'n Goblins is a sideways scrolling action platformer spread over six levels, each of which must be completed within three minutes (or a life is lost), taking in forest, village, mountain and cavern settings with increasing difficulty.

Arthur the brave knight must rescue his beloved Princess from the Demon King Astaroth and his forces - amongst them are the various undead (ghosts, zombies), bats, ogres and goblins. Other challenges include moving platforms, ladders and water/fire hazards. 

As in most games in this genre, the player can pick up power-ups such as daggers and bombs during the course of the game, giving the player greater firepower.</desc>

		<name>Ghoul School</name>
		<desc>In Ghoul School the player is cast as Spike O'Hara, a senior at Cool School High in a small American town. Spike is a rebel and an outcast, but is a good kid. While taking a shortcut through the graveyard home one day, he comes across a glowing skull. Intrigued, he takes it to Dr. Femur, his anatomy teacher, the next day, which happens to be the day before Halloween. Dr. Femur wants to keep it for an overnight study, and Spike reluctantly agrees, noticing that the skull appeared bigger than the day before.

During the night, the skull begins transmitting a message to the realm of the dead. On Halloween, the dead begin their assault. The teachers and students inside are turned into zombies and demons under the control of whatever intelligence has taken over the school. Samantha Pom-Pom, the head cheerleader, is captured by the dead and held somewhere inside the school. Paranormal eliminators and members of the football team have ventured inside to find her, but have not returned. When Spike learns of the mess from the TV news, he rushes to the school and decides to rescue her himself.

Spike ventures inside. The doors shut and lock behind him. There's no turning back now.

Spike begins his quest with only his trusty baseball bat and battered sneakers, but can collect better weapons and shoes along the way. Among them are the straightforward sickle, embalming fluid, towel and almighty gamma gun, the strange Deweytron and taserlike Spinal Zap, and a sandwich (if it can be used as a weapon, they should have fired the cafeteria workers a LONG time ago), among other weapons. Useful items include the spring shoes, needed to reach high places, the suction shoes, which allow you to walk on the ceiling, and the Golden Apple, needed to bypass the Medusa head guarding the way to the second half of the school.

Get going! You have 129 rooms to explore and Samantha is counting on you. Good luck.</desc>

		<name>Godzilla 2 : War of the Monsters</name>
		<desc>In a completely different style from the first Nintendo Godzilla game from Toho, you play as japanese military forces fighting against Godzilla. Because Godzilla is such a ferocious monster, this is no easy task... in fact, your attacks to Godzilla don't actually do any damage to him at all. Strategy instead becomes the main point of play as you must position forces in strategic points to route Godzilla away from important buildings and into other areas where his movement will be less destructive to the city. Actual success of these routing attacks is imperfect, if one is not careful, the whole offensive will fall apart over a single missed attack.
Beware Godzilla!</desc>

		<name>Godzilla 2 : War of the Monsters</name>
		<desc>In a completely different style from the first Nintendo Godzilla game from Toho, you play as japanese military forces fighting against Godzilla. Because Godzilla is such a ferocious monster, this is no easy task... in fact, your attacks to Godzilla don't actually do any damage to him at all. Strategy instead becomes the main point of play as you must position forces in strategic points to route Godzilla away from important buildings and into other areas where his movement will be less destructive to the city. Actual success of these routing attacks is imperfect, if one is not careful, the whole offensive will fall apart over a single missed attack.
Beware Godzilla!</desc>

		<name>Golf Grand Slam</name>
		<desc>This game was made with the intentions of helping the player improve their golf game. You can practice setting up putts, dealing with wind resistance, choosing a strike point on the golf ball, and other technical aspects of golfing in the two training modes the game offers. Once you feel you have enough experience you can enter the Golf Grand Slam, a tournament against 29 other fictitious pro players.

The game features 4 sets of 14 different golf clubs that you can bring to the course. The golfing is done by lining up a cursor to where you want the ball to land and then choosing the proper golf club, stance, and grip. The last step before taking the swing is finding the correct contact point on the golf ball. The contact point is represented as a dot that scatters around on top of a golf ball icon and you have to try to stop it on the part of the ball where you want your club to make contact with the ball.</desc>

		<name>The Goonies II</name>
		<desc>In a movie released in the 1980s, a group of youngsters formed a special gang and called themselves The Goonies.  Nintendo banked upon the movie’s popularity by releasing several games using the characters and music from it, including the theme song by Cyndi Lauper.  This is their second game on NES, The Goonies being released only for the Famicom system outside the United States.

You play Mikie, one of the gang members, whose friends have been kidnapped by the gang’s arch enemy – the Fratelli family.  Your buddies and Annie the Mermaid must be rescued, but it won’t be easy sneaking into the dark and creepy underground hideout where they are being held.  You must find a way to destroy their master computer and keep your friends from becoming road kill.  If Ma Fratelli or crazy Cousin Pipsqueak doesn’t stop you, one of her two crazy sons will!

Upon starting the game, Mikie is armed only with a yo-yo and the ability to jump.  As the game progresses, he will find boomerangs, a gun, bombs, molotave cocktails and even scuba gear to help him. Fight snakes, spiders, skeletons, man-eating fish while exploring the huge world full of cellars, secret caverns and elaborate mazes.

There is more than typical side-scrolling action, although there’s certainly a multitude of that.  Seventeen magic implements and many secret messages await you.  When Mikie enters a room he can talk to NPCs and try to find hidden items and doors by hitting the walls.  A password lets you keep your possessions for the next game.</desc>

		<name>Gotcha! : The Sport!</name>
		<desc>Gotcha! is an NES Zapper title based on the "sport" of paintball, and loosely tied into the paintball-themed movie caper of the same name. You are required to traverse three different battle zones, grab the opposing teams' flag from the opposite end of the field, and make it back to your flag without getting shot.

One hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.

The game contains three difficulty levels and three different zones (woods, city, snowfield) which cycle until you lose all of your lives. Numbers of enemies and their reaction time increase with each cycle. Aside from additional ammo, there are no powerups, no teammates, just you against the computer for a beat-your-highest-score challenge.</desc>

		<name>The Great Waldo Search</name>
		<desc>Based on the popular Where's Waldo series of books, the player's goal is to find Waldo, who is hidden in various pictures, before the time on the clock runs out. The player controls a magnifying glass and must click on various items for different effects. Finding a clock adds more time to the search, clicking on a 150 icon adds 150 points to the score, etc.

Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens containing a continuous theme. The themes are The Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The Battling Monks, The Unfriendly Giants and The Land of Waldos. Players are given the option of playing on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or playing the Land of Waldos stage. The only difference between the difficulties is that on expert there are no clock items to provide players with extra time.

In all of the stages the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. Waldo must be found before the scroll in order to complete the stage. Waldo's dog Woof is also in each of these stages (except for the Land of Waldos) and by finding him players get to play a small bonus stage where they collect points as they control the dog on a flying carpet.</desc>

		<name>Greg Norman's Golf Power</name>
		<desc>This golf game comes with pre-designed golf courses in locales such as the U.S.A., Japan, England, Scotland, Germany, Spain, France, Australia, and Hawaii. There is also an opportunity for the player to design their own golf course. The game features variable weather conditions like showers, downpours, wind, and sunshine. The game allows for both strokeplay and matchplay. It also allows for three difficulty levels: novice, amateur, and professional. Practice mode lets the player train on the putting green or on a practice hole.

Gameplay consists of aiming the golf ball and then swinging the chosen golf club. Swinging is done by a meter which measures the power of the shot and determines whether the ball gets hit straight, hooks, or slices. Putting is done with an overhead view on the green with the meter being used to measure the amount of power that is put on a putt.</desc>

		<desc>In the far future, Earth is a peaceful place with very few worries.  To ensure it stays that way, a top secret project was authorized: the creation of the guardian suit.  It's a suit of flight armor that allows the guardian to survive any environment.  It's a good thing too, because a giant space station is spotted on a collision course with Earth.

You take the role of the guardian.  Your mission is to activate the station's self-destruct and destroy it before it collides with Earth.  As you travel through the station NAJU, you'll find increased armor and better weapons to help you defeat waves of enemies.  You'll battle through the station in a human form and also as a jet in certain areas.</desc>

March through the rivers, swamps and forests to overthrow the dictator (specified as Batista in Japan) in this evolution of the Commando style.

The game scrolls vertically, as you move up the screen shooting enemies, finding good strategic firing points and collecting powerups. As the enemy soldiers come towards you in groups, some care is required when picking them off, either using your gun or the grenades. There are also hostages carried by some soldiers, with points bonuses for not shooting these but shooting their captors. Each level ends with a boss.</desc>

Throughout the levels there are five diamonds you must collect which are needed to complete the final level and rescue Jennifer, with plenty of obstacles and enemies to get in the way. During the game Mr. Stevenson continuously walks to the right and you have to use the light gun to save him from any obstacles blocking his path. Some obstacles can be destroyed with the light gun, others Mr. Stevenson will need to jump over (shooting him with the light gun will cause him to jump.) You have a limited amount of ammo, but more can be obtained by popping the balloons which are scattered throughout the levels.</desc>

		<name>Gun.Smoke</name>
		<desc>Gun.Smoke is a top-down scrolling shooter that casts the gamer as a lone gunman, out to save the gold rush town of Hicksville from a fearsome group of bandits known as the Wingates. Each level has a particular target enemy, although his or her henchmen must also be taken out.

Although it largely takes place on foot, the gameplay resembles Commando, with its top-down action. The screen scrolls at a constant rate, and enemies come at you from the edges, to be shot or avoided. You can grab various power-ups along the way. Finding a horse will allow you to get hit twice before you die rather than just once. There are scenes in which you raft up a river and use the tracks of a railway line.

On the NES you can tap the A button to fire up and right, the B button to fire up and left, or A and B simultaneously to fire straight ahead. One-button control systems mimic all this.</desc>

		<desc>In Gyromite, you need to help a mad scientist deactivate all of the dynamite in his laboratory before time runs out! ROB the robot will assist you in this game by moving the red and blue pillars blocking the way. Just in case finding your way through the laboratory wasn't enough, be sure to watch out for the deadly Smicks who wander about trying to prevent success of your mission. If you find a radish, pick it up and feed it to the Smicks so you can safely get past them. There is also a second game variation where you need to clear the way for a sleepwalking mad scientist so he can get home safely.</desc>

		<desc>The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single canon, and can gain a double canon after shooting a power up satelite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</desc>

		<desc>Just like Halloween 2015 and Halloween 2016, this game is intended to scare the player by abruptly showing a screaming face in the middle of gameplay. The time of play is longer than the previous versions, but the function is still the same. This was released on NintendoAge by auction in very limited numbers.</desc>

		<desc>In Hatris, the falling blocks of Tetris are replaced by falling hats which are  top hats, cowboy hats, baseball caps, derbys, party hats and crowns. The setting is a hat factory, where hats are dropped down from a conveyor belt two at a time and must be stacked on one of six mannequin heads. Once five hats of the same kind have been stacked on top of each other, they fall down onto another conveyor belt below and are shipped out of the factory, rewarding the player with a cash bonus. (The game keeps track of score as money, not simply points.)  Once you ship out enough hats out of the shop, you go up a level to the next shop. The higher shop number you get to, the more types of hats start appearing to make it more difficult for you to accomplish your task. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen.</desc>

		<desc>It's Halloween in 1985, the town of Possum Hollow has been haunted by an evil presence, turning even your best friends into brain-craving zombies and innocent pumpkins into poisonous, death-dealing obstacles. To get to the source of the evil you will need to battle the haunts, climb trees, avoid jagger bushes, navigate underground caverns and come face to face with an unexpected evil that you must overcome in order to climb out of your own grave. Six unique bosses await you as you battle through six different levels of haunted suburbia. Take control of Donny Johnstown and fight like the little bit-kicker that he is to prove that you have what it takes to save Possum Hollow!</desc>

		<desc>Heavy Barrel is a shooter with a top-down view similar to Commando and Ikari Warriors. Terrorists have seized the underground control complex of a nuclear missile site. It is up to the player to infiltrate the installation and eliminate the leader of the terrorist army before they can launch the missiles. To stop the terrorists you will need the powerful weapon Heavy Barrel. The problem is that the weapon still is in the installation. Before the fortress fell the weapon was taken apart and locked in six different storage lockers. To defeat the terrorists you must collect all keys and reassemble the weapon. The game supports co-op for two players.</desc>

		<name>Heavy Shreddin'</name>
		<desc>In this snowboarding game, the player goes on various runs completing events on downhill mountains. There are five events in all: Downhill, Slalom, Half-pipe, Moguls and Backwoods.  In Downhill the object is to get down the slope as fast as possible. In Slalom you have to guide the board between the gates. In halfpipe, you have to perform stunts on a half pipe. In Moguls, you have to jump over both small and large moguls. In Backwoods, you'll be given different obstacles to contend with and you'll have to find away to get around them.

You also earn points by executing various stunts along the way. Stunts you can pull off are a toe grab, hand-plant, mid-air 360, and a mule-kick.

There are three different peaks, each featuring a couple different runs. The mountain ranges consist of Poseur Peak, Scary Summit, and Mt. Mortified.</desc>

		<desc>High Speed is a conversion of the Williams Electronics pinball game of the same name. The game recreates the pinball table and gameplay from the arcade version and also adds some video game features, such as lightning bombs, attacking enemies, magnetic helicopters, and rust balls which dissolve your flipper. The bottom part of the screen remains on the bottom set of flippers, while the top half scrolls over the whole pinball table to follow the action. Gameplay is for one to four players alternating.</desc>

		<desc>This game involves the use of the Nintendo Light Zapper, and has, truly, no plot. You are in the police station doing target practice, either with three targets at a time with at least one innocent person, or in an alley with both good and bad targets in windows and walking on the sidewalk. Then there's Trick Shot, where you shoot the cans, trying to make them land in a slot for points, or at least not let them fall to the ground.</desc>

		<name>Hollywood Squares</name>
		<desc>This is a GameTek conversion of the '80s version of the game show Hollywood Squares.  Two contestants play a version of tic-tac-toe, with "celebrities" filling in for the squares. The selected celeb is asked a question, answers it, and the contestant must agree or disagree with their answer. A correct guess captures that square.  After three games, the winning contestant picks a key and a car out of two separate pools, hoping to match the two up and win the car.</desc>

		<name>Holy Diver</name>
		<desc>Randy, the Holy Diver, is setting out to retrieve the five emblem seals belonging to the King Crimson Family in order to expel the greatest evil, the Black Slayer, back into another dimension.

Holy Diver is an action game much in the vein of Castlevania. The player controls the Diver as he uses magic powers such as shooting energy balls and freezing time to traverse the game's eight levels. Enemies throughout the levels respawn and there are destroyable objects in your path. At the end of each level a tougher boss character must be beaten. Once defeated a power-up spell becomes available to the player. To use these spells the player must pause the game and select it from the inventory menu. The player has the ability to shoot horizontally as well as up. Difficult paths may sometimes be crossed by the combination of the right spell at the right time such as the freezing spell that freezes quicksand. 

Though scheduled for release in North America, the game never went beyond its release in Japan.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the film of the same name, Kevin McAllister has been left home alone for Christmas while his family is on vacation. This would not be so bad except for two burglars, Harry and Marv, aka the Wet Bandits, have decided to burglarize his house. However, Kevin is too smart to play victim and will use the items he has available to make traps for the burglars.

Home Alone is a side scroller. Controlling Kevin, the player must wander around Kevin's house picking up icons representing different kinds of traps. He then drops these icons onto the ground, in the path of one of the burglars, stunning them and earning a score. Once stunned, Kevin can walk past them and continue collecting trap icons.</desc>

		<desc>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.

This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</desc>

The legends of the Playground are all here: Mr. Doc, Jammer, Legs, Bomber, Wiz, eight players in all. You can pit them one-on-one or two-on-two. You pick the court - Eastern or Western - and you pick the rules, too. You can play against the computer or one other player. Or you can even team up with another player against the computer. You can block shots, make steals, pass off or go strong to the hoop - in fact, you control just about everything in this ultra-realistic rendition of the playground game. Except, of course, the final score. But win or lose, you know you've been in a game after you've played a game of HOOPS!</desc>

		<name>Hoppin' Mad</name>
		<desc>Hoppin' Mad is an action game released in 1988 by Elite Systems for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. The game takes place over 12 levels. On each level, the player has to guide a group of bouncing balls from the right edge of the level to the left edge. The balls are constantly bouncing, and the player can only alter their travel speed (by moving the joystick left or right) or make them bounce higher (by pressing the fire button). Various different dangers appear on the levels, including sharp rocks, venus flytraps, hedgehogs and flying birds. The balls can also collect balloons for bonus points. The game starts with four balls, and each time the balls collide with a dangerous object, one ball bursts. If all four balls are burst, the player loses a life. Elite Systems developed this NES version which was never released.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Soviet Union have been building in secret a Typhoon-class submarine with nuclear strike capabilities. This war machine has been named the Red October. While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. 

You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</desc>

		<desc>An evil demon named Varalys casts a curse upon the princess Ann, turning her into three fairies. You control Sir Jim and set out to find the fairies, and then slay Varalys.  Only by vanquishing Varalys can the curse be lifted. Once the princess is restored the kingdom will be saved.

The fighting is a little more in-depth than hack and slash.  You can either fight with a defensive or offensive stance, or you can use magic spells.</desc>

		<name>Ice Hockey</name>
		<desc>Ice Hockey is an action game for one or two players. Start of by selecting a team and customizing your players. Each team member can be one of three player types: small and skinny (very fast, but not good at checking or shooting), very large (slow, but with a strong body check and outstanding shooting strength) or average (medium speed, with average checking and shooting strength). After the teams are set up, it's time to play some ice hockey! Gameplay features a scrolling screen to follow the action, and lets you choose which of the players you wish to control when on defense (on offense you always control the player with the puck). Fights can break out between players, and the loser may end up in the penalty box. There are five different speed settings for the game, and periods can be either 7, 10, or 15 minutes long.</desc>

But there are also power-ups scattered around in small green containers. You must destroy these containers before you can obtain the power-up. Those power-ups include pods that add extra attack power or speed, new kinds of weapons, the ability to fire in different directions, etc.</desc>

		<name>The Immortal</name>
		<desc>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of 
isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.

The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.</desc>

		<name>The Incredible Crash Dummies</name>
		<desc>Junkman breaks into the crash test center and kidnaps two of the Incredible Crash Dummies, Daryl and Spare Tire with the intentions of using them for their parts to build his junkbots. Now it's up to Slick and Spin to go and rescue the kidnapped crash dummies.

In The Incredible Crash Dummies the player alternates between Slick and Spin as they go through five levels with each level containing 2 stages (except for the 4th level which only consists of one). One of the Dummies' legs has been replaced with a wheel while the other Dummy has his legs intact. So the main difference in gameplay is that in some stages the player either rolls throughout it or walks throughout it. The Dummies' arsenal includes an air gun which stuns enemies at close range and an oil gun which shoots and kills enemies at a far range. There are also a few powerups scattered throughout the stages such as the arrow, balloon, and arm powerup.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</name>
		<desc>As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary. 

This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade</name>
		<desc>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade differs from the two other games with the same name as it is a hybrid of various genres such as platform action, motorcycle racing, puzzle solving and even some adventure elements.

In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade you play Indy's role in his search for the Holy Grail, but this time it is you who chooses which step he will take at each part of his quest. For example, in the very beginning you receive a diary about the Grail from Indy's father, who is in Venice. At the same time, you receive a telegram from Marcus saying that the Cross of Coronado is in Portugal on a ship called Coronado, and that he'll meet Indy there. So you have to choose what you'll do first: go to Venice and check about the Grail and your father, or go to Portugal to find Marcus and the Cross of Coronado.

In the entire game you'll be prompted with these choices, each one leading to different stages throughout the game. Each stage presents different game genres. For example, in Venice you find a scrambled picture of the Grail, and you have to try to put it back together, just like you'd do with the pieces of a puzzle. Besides, in the platform stages, Indy has plenty of movements, as he can punch, kick, walk, run, jump and use his whip.

The game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</name>
		<desc>The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy you must complete several cycles of the following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.
With every cycle the mine &amp; mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.</desc>

Isolated Warrior is a constantly-moving shoot-em-up, or shmup, where the hero is always walking or flying forward from an isometric overhead perspective. The hero has a basic laser gun to start with but collects powerups that can allow the gun to fire in multiple directions. He can also collect bombs that can be launched in multiple directions while jumping, as well as shield powerups.</desc>

		<name>Ivan "Ironman" Stewart's Super Off Road</name>
		<desc>Enter the world of off-road racing as 4 vehicles will face each other, on a series of tracks which are based around flipped and reversed versions of a core selection. Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.

Successful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits.</desc>

		<desc>The enemy army has captured too many of your forces. Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war... unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals...

Jackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your gernades (upgradable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you'll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress.</desc>

		<name>Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu</name>
		<desc>Jackie Chan and his twin sister Josephine were great kung fu fighters in China and trained under a great master. One day when Jackie and Josephine were out walking, the Master's great enemy, The Sorcerer appeared. The Sorcerer had come to rule over China and knew the twins would stand in his way... so he cast a spell to make Josephine disappear. Now it's up to Jackie Chan to follow after the Sorcerer and battle his minions in order to rescue his sister and save China.

Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu is a side-scrolling fighting game. Jackie's controls are one button to jump and another one to attack or be used in combination with a direction for a special attack. On his quest, Jackie must punch and kick his way past frogs, ninjas, birds and other enemies. Jackie can acquire special-moves such as the Tornado attack, the 180 degree spin kick, the 360 degree spin kick and the Sky Attack. Other power-ups include energy refills and bonus points.</desc>

		<name>Jaws</name>
		<desc>Loosely based on the fourth movie "Jaws: the Revenge", players take control of a ship to sail the ocean in the search for the killer shark.  Along the way, the ship will stop to allow a diver to swim out and kill baby sharks, jellyfish and manta rays to find conch shells.  The conch shells are used to buy upgrades for the boat.  Extra conch shells can be earned in bonus rounds where a sea plane flies over the water to bomb jellyfish (think the bonus rounds of Galaga with reversed perspective).

The diver will battle Jaws several times in an attempt to wear down his life meter.  If the player is lucky, they can find a submarine to increase their firepower and defense.

If the diver manages to wear down Jaws' energy, they take back to the boat again, launching strobes into the water in an attempt to lure the shark out of the water.  If close enough, the player can use the boat to ram Jaws in an attempt to kill him and win the game.</desc>

If three human players are engaged, then Player 1 and 2 share the first controller, with the second controller going to Player 3.

For the first two rounds, six categories with five questions each are randomly selected by the computer to populate the game board. The contestant who answered the last question correctly gets to pick the category and a dollar value, with harder questions being worth more money. Players have ten seconds from the time a question appears to "ring in" with the appropriate controller button and answer.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the television game show of the same name.  The 25th anniversary edition of this quiz show requires you to provide 'questions' in response to the 'answer' clues.  The harder the question the more money it is worth.

You can play with 1-3 players.  If less than 3 players are competing they may choose whether or not to play against the computer.

Three skill levels provide  40, 45 or 50 seconds allowed to key in your answer.

The first part of the "question" (WHO IS...or WHAT IS...or WHAT ARE, etc.) will appear with a number/letter grid (not QWERTY).  You response must be the EXACT spelling and tense that the system is looking for or it will not be accepted as a correct "question".</desc>

		<name>Jeopardy! Junior Edition</name>
		<desc>A conversion of the popular TV game show for younger players ages 7 and up.

Up to three players can take part in the three-round trivia contest where the answers are given and the contestants must supply the correct question.

In the first two rounds, six categories of five answers each are randomly chosen by the computer to fill the "wall" and the player begins by choosing any one of them.  After the chosen answer is given, the first player to hit his "buzzer" gives the response using the controller to move a cursor over an onscreen keyboard, spelling out the question within the time limit.  In the final round, a category is announced and the players each place a bet, up to the limit of their winnings so far, on the final question.  After all players are ready, the final answer is shown and all players give their questions.

There are three difficulty levels and the computer can supply opponents if desired.</desc>

		<name>The Jetsons : Cogswell's Caper!</name>
		<desc>The Jetsons: Cogwell's Caper is based on the well-known Jetsons property from Hanna-Barbera. In this spin-off adventure, George Jetson is tasked my his employer to put a stop to the profit-making schemes of the rival Cogswell's company. To do this, George must hop from location to location in his jet and conquer each level using the resources available to him, as well as with the assistance of the other Jetson franchise characters.

Cogswell's Caper is a side-scrolling action game where George Jetson can walk, crouch, and jump (actually, he's too lazy to jump and a jet pack handles the jumping duty for short bursts). Each level is littered with crates and other items that George can pick up and toss at enemies, while finding useful items (and occasionally even more enemies) underneath them. Since the game is set in the futuristic world of the Jetsons, there are also copious switches on walls which activate all kinds of features of the surroundings, such as a switch that reverses gravity for a brief time.</desc>

Select your team's home city (there is no NFL or NFLPA license, so there are no real teams or players) and then battle the opposing team for four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  Graphics are simple: one team has blue uniforms, the other team red ones.  The human player gets control of the quarterback on offense and the middle linebacker on defense.  The play perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling.  Choose from 9 offensive--mostly passing--plays and 6 defensive plays.  Teams have 9 players each.</desc>

		<name>Jordan vs Bird : One On One</name>
		<desc>Two of the greatest icons of the Golden Age of the NBA match up in this game. On one side, the spectacular dunks of Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls; on the other, Larry Bird's incredible accuracy from the outside. 

While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal, each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts from the judges, and win the competition.

While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird's stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan's speed and jumping abilities?</desc>

		<name>Joust</name>
		<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>

		<name>Jurassic Park</name>
		<desc>One of many different titles based on Steven Spielberg's 1993 dinosaur thriller, the version for NES and Game Boy is a top-down action game with exploration elements.

Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player must work through six levels by completing certain objectives including rescuing the kids Tim and Lex, restoring power, destroying Raptor nests and finally getting off the dinosaur-infested island. To advance in a level, a number of dinosaur eggs scattered over the area must be collected or destroyed. This will reveal a passcard used to gain entry to buildings, or some other items necessary to complete the assignment. The park's computer terminals can be used to request hints on where to go next.

Naturally, the levels are full of hostile dinosaurs. Dr. Grant can fend them off with his gun. Several ammunition types are available, varying in damage and shooting patterns. Killed dinosaurs will always drop the most basic ammo type, the others must be found. Next to ammo clips, there are boxes with question marks on them to be collected. These might include beneficial powerups like a health increase, but can also be dangerous and reveal a bomb.

Some levels end in boss encounters, including a Triceratops stampede and a fight against the Tyrannosaurus Rex.</desc>

		<name>Kickle Cubicle</name>
		<desc>Kickle Cubicle is a Lolo type sliding puzzle game where the Wicked Wizard King covered the kingdom with ice and hid the people and palaces deep within the ice.

Armed with his freezing breath, Kickle sets out to save his friends and attempts to rescue the kingdom from this puzzling predicament of perpetual winter.

Each level has a fixed time limit and enemies that will try and block your progress. The four lands (Garden, Fruit, Cake and Toy) have 17 or 18 puzzles in each. Beat all of those and there is a Special Stage with 30 more challenging puzzles.

Your main options are to move, make a block of ice and slide a block of ice.

Objects appearing in puzzles include: 

1. Rock: You cannot go over these but you can use them to stop sliding ice cubes.
Slippery Ice: Enemies can not go there.
Base Rock: These can not be destroyed and enemies generate from them.
Spring: Springs an ice cube across the screen.
Water Hole: You can't fill or walk across these holes in the ice.
Breaker: Shatters ice cubes that strike its corners.
Hammer: Changes ice cube direction and hits enemies.
Power Rock: Hit this and all enemies will freeze.</desc>

		<desc>The evil wizard Belzed and his forces have attacked the kingdom of Lowrel, killed its king and queen and kidnapped princess Silphee. Players take control of aspiring martial artist Thonolan who sets out to rescue Silphee and defeat Belzed.

Kick Master is a side-scrolling platformer in which enemies are defeated by using various kicks and spells. Defeated enemies drop three items that refill Thoalon's health or magic, grant an extra life, damage him or increase his experience. When Thoalan gains a level, his maximum MP is increased and he learns new kicks, such as sliding, flying, roundhouse or butterfly kicks. Along the way, he can also pick up different spells that damage his enemies, protect him or refill his health.</desc>

		<name>Akumajou Special - Boku Dracula-kun</name>
		<desc>Kid Dracula is an unusual side-scroller from Konami.  It's  a parody of the company's popular Castlevania series. Instead of playing as a member of the Belmont family, you play as young Kid Dracula.

You have been woken up from your sleep by the evil demon Garamos, who's been wrecking havoc in Dracula's Castle. It's up to you to stop him by traveling across several different locations, including Dracula's Castle, New York, the Sea, and Egypt!

Gameplay consists of very standard jump and shoot platform action.  As you progress through the 8 levels, you gain the ability to perform spells, such as turning into a bat, and different special attacks, such as a spread / homing attack. You can also spend the coins you get when you defeat enemies in one of several mini-games that show up when you're between levels.</desc>

		<desc>Far away in peaceful Angel Land lived a young angel warrior named Pit, who has been given the task of defeating the monstrous Medusa, who wishes to destroy Angel Land and all of the people, and she has started by kidnapping Palutena, the Princess of Angel Land.

Young Pit must rescue the Princess and restore peace to Angel Land. He will travel from the deep caverns of the Underworld to Medusa's palace in the sky on his journey, and deadly monsters will attack him every step of the way. But he has the power of the Gods on his side! A powerful bow and arrows, Water of Life, and Angel Feathers will assist Pit on his quest to destroy Medusa and save the princess!

Kid Icarus is a platform game where the player goes through several vertically outlaid levels, shooting enemies with his bow on the way and collecting hearts they leave behind. Pit's bow can shoot both forward and upwards. As Pit continues upwards, more and more of the level ends up beyond the bottom of the screen and if Pit falls down out of the screen, he dies. 

The levels contain doors which lead to chambers of various types - some chambers are filled with enemies, some are treasuries which allow Pit to obtain a power-up, some are stores where Pit can buy stuff, some will replenish his health, in some Pit will be able to take a test in hopes of getting a powerful weapon, and finally some chambers give Pit a chance of receiving a strength upgrade, therefore increasing the amount of damage his attacks deal. 

Pit earns experience as he defeats enemies, and he gains levels from this experience. The more levels Pit has, the more maximum health he has. 

Hearts taken from enemies are used in shops to buy various items and power-ups. Items include a protective shield which harms enemies, a more powerful bow, a mallet which allows you to smash the poor Palutena's warriors turned to stone who will later help you to fight a boss, a torch to see yourself in dark areas and others.</desc>

He asks Kid Klown to help him open a treasure vault, but Kid Klown, having been warned about the evil magician by his parents, refuses. Not willing to give up so easily, Night Mayor kidnaps Kid Klown's family and dares him to follow him into his world if he ever wants to see his family again.

Kid Klown in Night Mayor World is a side-scrolling platformer. Kid Klown has to complete several different stages inhabited by various enemies. His most helpful tools are his balloons that he can throw at his enemies, use as a trampoline or cling to in order to float through the air. 

There are various items to be picked up as well, including bonus lifes, health power-ups, strawberries, lightnings that make Kid Klown temporarily invincible and question marks that can have the same effect as any of the other items, but might also reverse the controls.

After every completed stage, a bonus game can be played in which Kid Klown may win items by throwing balloons at them. The number of balloons available depends on the number of strawberries collected in the previous stage.</desc>

		<name>Kid Kool and the Quest for the Seven Wonder Herbs</name>
		<desc>Kid Kool is a side-scrolling platformer.  The king is sick and Kool must gather the seven magical herbs to cure him within three days.

Unlike most platformers, momentum is very important in Kid Kool.  He takes several steps to get up to full speed when running and cannot stop on a dime.  There is no air control, so how far he is able to jump depends entirely on how fast he was going when he left the ground.

Kool faces a variety of enemies.  They can be defeated by jumping on their heads.  The first jump drives them into the ground and the second eliminates them.  They also can be beaten with a furry companion that Kool can pick up by running fast enough past the appropriate spots.  He can be thrown with the B button, then retrieved by standing near him.  He also affords some protection as if Kool is hit while holding him, he will only lose his companion, not a life.</desc>

		<name>King's Quest V</name>
		<desc>The NES version of King's Quest V retains the icon-based interface and most of the locations, puzzles, and dialogue from the earlier release. Graphics had to be re-drawn with less colors and detail to fit within the restrictions of the hardware, and the artwork in many areas is different.

This version removes most alternate solutions to puzzles and does not allow many actions that would render the game unwinnable. It also shortens and eliminates several scenes; for example, it is impossible to revisit the wizard in the first house. A few locations (such as the desert) are smaller. Some death sequences have been removed or modified not to include words related to death; also, some text descriptions were altered.</desc>

		<desc>Fami-chan was stomping about her room, fuming. Paso-kun was late. And she did not like being kept waiting. "'I'll bring you something nice,' he says, and then no word for hours! What sort of trouble did he get himself into this time?" she wondered aloud. "What do I see in him, anyway?" From her window, Fami-chan absently watched the sun slowly sink beneath the horizon. As the last slice of sun disappeared, an unnatural darkness fell like a curtain across the land. She gasped at the suddenness of it. Above her head, the night sky was a solid, unbroken black. "What's going on!" she cried. Where was the moonlight? Where was the starlight? Fami-chan leaned out her window, peering up at the featureless black sky. A sudden bright pinpoint of light appeared, flashing through the darkness. It rocketed across the sky toward her, zipping past her head and into her room like a miniature meteor. She let out a surprised yelp and turned. On her bedroom floor she saw, of all things, a tiny, strange looking mouse.</desc>

		<name>Kitty's Catch</name>
		<desc>Kitty's Catch is a cancelled NES game created by GameTek employee David Wiebenson in his spare time. Wiebenson pitched Kitty's Catch to several publishers, all of which refused to publish the game. Eventually, several prototypes were discovered and purchased in a lot by the Nolan brothers, who released the most complete ROM to the public.
Kitty's Catch is a two-player game where players control cats named Pitter and Patter, and have to catch fish with their tails. The first player to fill their bucket with fish gets a shell, and the player with the most shells at the end of the time limit wins. There are also several power-ups obtained by collecting tin cans, such as larger hooks.</desc>

		<name>Kiwi Kraze : A Bird-Brained Adventure!</name>
		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

The ball must be thrown into the goal at your opponent's end. Any amount of physical contact can be made, and there are no illegal ways to get the ball or the goal.

Before each match you can bribe the referee into awarding you a head-start or strengthening the abilities of your players. You compete in a simple knockout cup tournament, or in individual 2-player games.</desc>

		<desc>Krazy Kreatures is an action strategy game for one or two players. Critters of all sorts will fill up the game board and you need to move them around to line up creatures of the same type before the entire board becomes filled. Depending on the type of creature, you will need to line up 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the same type of creature for them to disappear. After you have cleared a certain number of creatures, the board will stop filling up and you have a limited amount of time to try to clear as many creatures as possible for bonus points. As the levels progress the game board changes shape and will fill up faster and faster with different creatures.</desc>

		<name>The Krion Conquest</name>
		<desc>The Krion Empire chose the year 1999 in which to stage an invasion of earth. The planet's defenses were no match for the alien robot invaders. Fortunately, a witch named Francesca has taken it upon herself to single-handedly free mankind from this scourge.

The gameplay and artistic style are heavily influenced by the NES Mega Man games (some contend the elements are "borrowed" or "stolen", in fact). The game is a side scroller in which the heroine can wield a variety of different offensive capabilities (all available from the start of the game), selectable via a subscreen in her quest to wipe out wave after wave of robot invaders throughout the four levels. You also have a limited range broomstick at your disposal for riding across chasms and such.</desc>

		<desc>Krusty the Clown's Fun House has been overrun by rats.  You must help him to herd the rats into trap machines to clear them out.  In order to do so, Krusty must manipulate his environment to set up pathways so that the rats are headed in the right direction.  Objects that Krusty move around include blocks, fans, and pipe pieces.

The trap machines are operated by other recognizable Simpson's characters:  Bart, Homer, Sideshow Mel, and Corporal Punishment.</desc>

		<name>Kung-Fu Heroes</name>
		<desc>Kung-Fu masters Jacky and Lee (Lee and Loo in the arcade version) return to their kingdom from a long trip. They discover that in their absence, Princess Min-min has been kidnapped and the 10 treasures of the kingdom stolen. Jacky and Lee must fight their way into eight different castles in order to defeat the monsters and rescue the princess.

Chinese Hero is a top-down action game for one or two players, both playing on the same screen. Each ninja has the ability to move in any of four directions: up, down, left and right, as well as punch directly in front of them and do a "Moon Sault Kick" (which can be powered up to a "Miracle Kick") whereby they jump and somersault directly in front. Both punches and the Moon Sault Kick can harm enemies. Defeating a certain number of enemies on each level will open the doorway into the next level. Occasionally extra passages (named "Quick Passage Zone") can be found to take shortcuts through areas with stronger enemies. At times, defeated enemies will leave power-ups behind which either player can collect in order to increase their abilities temporarily. While power-ups are diverse, here are examples of some of the effects: weakening specific enemies, invincibility, increased attack, extra lives and the ability to use projectile attacks.</desc>

		<desc>In Laser Invasion you are trying to stop the enemy from deploying a new type of super weapon while saving a captured undercover agent.

The game is a compilation of familiar types of gameplay. The first stage is a helicopter aerial battle similar to Top Gun. The second stage is a first person side-scrolling shooter like Operation Wolf. The third stage is a maze hunt with influences from Golgo 13.

The game plays out in four levels.</desc>

		<desc>Danny Madigan is watching a sneak preview of the latest film of his favourite hero, Jack Slater, when he is mysteriously catapulted inside the screen; now standing next to his favourite idol. You are Jack Slater, an action movie hero, who takes on the ax maniac “The Ripper”, who is holding a school under siege, and Benedict, a villain who wants to use Danny’s ticket to bring terror to the real world.

The game, based on the film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is very different for each platform. For most of them, the gameplay can be split up into two parts: side-scrolling fighting levels and wild car chases on the streets.</desc>

Through six 3D stages, you'll have to use both your ninja skills as a fighter and a thinker to take on your enemies and solve the puzzles impeding your progress. You'll amass many types of weapons and objects along the way, but their ultimate use may differ from the obvious. In the end, you'll have to show Kunitoki who's boss in any century.

		<desc>The Last Starfighter is based on the 1984 movie of the same name. The hero must single-handedly pilot an extraordinarily powerful starfighter to destroy an enemy armada. The action takes place in outer space from a side-scrolling perspective where the ship always remains lined up in the middle of the screen but is able to turn forwards and backwards while accelerating and decelerating. The ship can also collapse into a slimmer configuration. Enemies come at you from all directions and in all formations. Shoot them as quickly as possible while also disabling the enemy fleet's starcruisers as best you can.

The game also features a 2-player mode where each player takes turns fighting the armada.</desc>

		<name>Lee Trevino's Fighting Golf</name>
		<desc>When this golf simulation was released in 1988 the U.S. National Video Game Team said it was "by far the best video golf simulation available".

1 to 4 players can tee it up on either an 18 hole American course or an 18 hole Japanese course.  Players 1 &amp; 3 share controller 1 and players 2 &amp; 4 share controller 2.

Game modes are:

1. Stroke Play - The winner has the lowest number of strokes through 18 holes.
Nassau Game - The players compete against each other for points.  Presses are allowed.
Practice - A single player can practice on their favorite hole.

Swing mechanics are: Press A to start the backswing, press A at the top of the swing, press A at impact. High and low shots can be selected by pressing up or down on the control pad. Right after contact another quick press of the A button at the same time as left or right will apply backspin to the ball. Complete club selection is available with the B button.  

Terrain includes tee, green, fairway, out-of-bounds, water, sand (light and hard), and rough (super, light, heavy and deep).

There are four available characters:

1. Pretty Amy - Slow swing speed with fantastic ball control and accurate aiming.
Big Jumbo - Powerful stroke and a long hitter but good technique is needed to control his shots.
Super Mex - All-around player with average distance, accuracy and swing speed.
Miracle Chosuke - Less power than Super Mex but good at putting and unequalled accuracy.  He can hit a "Reverse Miracle Putt."</desc>

		<name>Legacy of the Wizard</name>
		<desc>Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.

Legacy of the Wizard is an side-scrolling action platform game with role-playing elements.  The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.

The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-resoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</desc>

		<desc>In 1990 , Arcadia games. Licensed by Nintendo. 
Although, here is another fine game that never made it on the shelves. This game was in production, unfortunately Kevin Costner's movie was also in production at the same time.
This proved bad timing on Arcadia's behalf.

This game was in the final stages before release. At this vital time Kevin Costner's movie was released. Robin Hood, prince of thieves. But Arcadia didn't have the funds to obtain licensing from both Nintendo, and the movie, they were forced to pull out. The game itself is a lot of fun, it's an action RPG and it shows the life of all the Merry-Men.</desc>

		<name>The Legend of Zelda</name>
		<desc>In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.

The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. 

Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. 

There are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. 

To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. 

If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the "2nd quest", which is essentially a harder version of the game. 

The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.</desc>

		<name>The Legend of Zelda</name>
		<desc>In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.

The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. 

Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. 

There are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. 

To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. 

If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the "2nd quest", which is essentially a harder version of the game. 

The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.</desc>

		<name>Legendary Wings</name>
		<desc>Legendary Wings is an arcade shooter influenced by Greek mythology.  A heroic figure from ancient times thrust into a strange futuristic world, you must fight your way through six levels to defeat "The Devil" and save the day.

The primary gameplay mode is a top-down, vertical-scrolling shooter similar to Xevious and Capcom's own 1943.  Your main weapon is used to attack flying enemies, and your secondary missile weapon is used to attack fixed placement, land-based enemies.  Numerous powerups are available along the way, and these both improve your weapons and your resistance to damage (every "upgrade" is worth a free hit from enemies without dying).

Several secondary gameplay modes (Danger, Lucky, and Palace) are also triggered at key points in the vertical-scrolling mode.  All of the secondary modes are side-scrolling shooters.  The Danger stage requires you to face a gauntlet of enemies, while the Lucky stage is full of powerups, game continues, and other bonuses.  The Palace stage is triggered when you defeat a mini-boss; you must get past the palace defenses before you can face the end-of-stage boss.  And, oh yeah...don't get crushed by those walls!</desc>

		<name>The Legends of Owlia</name>
		<desc>The Legends of Owlia is Gradual Games' second release for the NES.
It is an action-adventure game inspired by StarTropics, Crystalis, and the Legend of Zelda.

Once upon a time. On a world far beyond imagining. Six great owls brought forth a land called Owlia. Together, they reigned in peace and wisdom for eighty thousand years. However, their pride in the beautiful land and sky of Owlia led them to forget the vast vast seas... Mermon, King of the Mermen, oft rose to the surface to view the Land of Owlia. His desire for sunlight, sky, and green forests grew until he decided the seas were not enough for him. He endeavored to summon the six great owls one by one. He began sapping their powers of flight, empowering his minions to float towards the Land of Owlia to claim it for his own. However, one great owl eluded him.. Silmaran, the White King. Soaring high above the Land of Owlia, as Mermon's forces grew in power, he searched for one who might heed his call to rescue the great owls and restore the Land of Owlia.

		<name>Legends of the Diamond : The Baseball Championship Game</name>
		<desc>This baseball game features 30 all-time great baseball players (only 6 are pitchers). There is an exhibition mode which is just a single game and a tournament mode where you pick your players and then the computer pits you against the others in random made teams; win and you advance on to the next game. 

Pitching is done by a behind the batter view. The pitchers can throw the ball with three different speeds; slow, medium, and fast. Also, the fielders are controlled manually.

You can also choose between an old classic style stadium or a new modern style one. Besides the actual look of the place the only real difference between the two is that it's easier to hit a homerun in the old style stadium.</desc>

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>

		<desc>You get your choice of 16 teams to play, eight domestic teams and eight foreign teams from Asia and Europe. In One-Player mode you play the computer in an international tournament. For Two Players, you each have a squad in the tourney. All games are seven innings long.

To help you pick a team, Power Analysis screen enables you to see how teams rate on hitting, pitching, overall defense, and running.

When you're up to bat you can move around in the box, control your swing, and bunt. Pitcher's have a choice of fastball and changeup, and curving the ball left and right. On defense, all players can dive for balls or jump up to snare line drives. A great defensive plus here is the ability to move players into pre-set defensive shifts, for example, to defend against pull hitters or bunts</desc>

		<name>Little Medusa</name>
		<desc>Little Medusa is an action puzzle game with gameplay similar to titles like Adventures of Lolo and Kickle Cubicle. Artemiza is a goddess and the daughter of Zeus. She is also the successor to his throne on Mount Olympus. She is very vain and Fiora, the goddess of strife and magic, turns her into the gorgon Medusa. She also makes the other gods believe Artemiza has disappeared. Fiora frees the Titans and takes over the throne. Now Medusa is the only one who can stop her.

The game consists of five worlds with multiple levels and a world ends with a boss fight. Each world is tied to one of the Titans: Ariadne (water), Coeus (wind), Ermolai (earth), Fiora (magic and discord) and Thia (fire). A level consists of a single, fixed screen that is completed once Medusa has collected all yellow stars. She has two lives at the start and there are enemies roaming. She can petrify enemies with her gaze and then push them into the water to create bridges. She can also create stone blocks that serve as obstacles.

Some enemies have attacks and they respawn from pots. Later levels introduce keys, chests, rotatable arrow tiles that change the movement direction of pushed enemies, and additional lives that can be picked up. The game keeps track of the score and has a timer counting down. If the game is completed quickly enough a sixth and final world is unlocked with a new ending to the story. The game has achievements and an Olympian mode with permadeath.</desc>

		<desc>In this version of Disney's The Little Mermaid you play as Ariel the mermaid.

Ariel has already met Eric, and they plan to wed, but the sea-witch Ursala has taken control of the ocean!  So Ariel (After explaining what's going on to Eric) becomes a mermaid once more and sets off to rescue the sea.

The game takes place from a side view and Ariel (Swimming most of the time, but hopping around on the land occasionally) can shoot bubbles to trap her foes and can then throw them at each other.  She can also dig through sand to find treasure and pick up sea shells to help her break chests open.

The treasure she finds in the sand is usually just bonus points, but the treasure you find in chests will increase your bubble's power and range.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/20230123-044446 [headered]/Little Samson (USA).nes</path>
		<name>Little Samson</name>
		<desc>Ta-Keed, the Prince of Darkness, has managed to escape from his supernatural penitentiary where he has had centuries to plot exactly how he will take revenge on those that locked him away. Emperor Hans sends his troops to deal with this threat, but they are no match for the ultimate evil one. As an alternative, the emperor summons the bearers of 4 Magical Bells. These 4 adventurers must make their way to the castle and work as a team if they are to destroy Ta-Keed.

The first part of Little Samson has each of the 4 characters journeying from his or her home land to the emperor's palace. This gives the player an opportunity to explore that character's unique abilities which will be essential throughout the game.

1. Samson is a human who is reasonably fast and also possesses magnificent rock climbing prowess. He is able to scale walls and hang across ceilings, and also grab onto walls and ceilings while jumping. His offensive option is the ability to shoot bells straight ahead.

2. Kikira is the Dragon Lord. Since she has claws, she does not slip on ice. When she jumps, she can also fly for short bursts. She breathes fire in 2 intensities, depending on how long the player holds down the fire button. Her fireballs spread in arc patterns.

3. Gamm is the Rock Lord. Since he is a living rock he is very strong. So strong in fact that spikes do not hurt him, which is very valuable in a number of situations. He is also very slow and has only a short leap. He has a powerful punch.

4. K.O. is the Mouse Lord. He is tiny which allows him to enter areas that other team members can not. He is also extremely fast and the highest jumper of the team. However, he is the weakest member so he can not sustain very much damage. He has the same wall and ceiling traversal abilities as Samson. Offensively, he can drop time-delay bombs.

When all 4 characters reach the emperor's palace, they all jump into Samson's bell. Actually, Gamm and K.O. quietly jump into Samson's bell; Kikira initially refuses. After a brief fight (with the player controlling Samson), Kikira joins the effort. Throughout the rest of the game, the player can switch between any of the 4 characters by entering the sub-screen. Each character has their own power meter. However, all the characters share lives. If the presently selected character loses all of his or her power, then one life is lost. The player must swap between all 4 characters in order to complete the journey.</desc>

		<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

There are also multiple environments and different game modes. The characters are described as lumberjacks. Matches take place on a fixed screen view shown from an elevated position. Characters are standing on rolling logs and throw an axe that acts like a ball.

In a typical tournament different opponents need to be defeated one after the other. Points are scored by throwing the axe into the goal area behind the opponent. This zone is different for each environment. Sometimes there is only a single, large goal area, while another environment has three zones for five, two and five points respectively. In some levels like North Pool the middle part is entirely open, while in others like Mount Olympus the axe can only be thrown through a few open passages.</desc>

		<name>The Lone Ranger</name>
		<desc>In the early 1880's in Texas, a man has returned to bring  justice to the outlaw who murdered his brother and his former comrades, the Texas Rangers. His name is the Lone Ranger. The outlaw, whose name is Butch Cavendish, has now kidnapped the President. The time has come for the masked man to begin his journey of adventure for the purpose of safely rescuing the President and avenging the deaths of his brother and former comrades.

The game takes you through 8 western-themed regions, each 
with a different objective, all of which brings you closer to your nemesis, Butch Cavendish. The game features many points of view during gameplay. Most of the time, the game is played from a top-down perspective, as you travel through the country and walk through towns. At other times, the game switches to a side scrolling view when you are in a boss stage. On occasion, the view switches to a first person perspective and plays similar to a first person shooter.

Each bad guy you kill is worth money. You can use money to buy more bullets, dynamite, rifles or a patch up from a doctor. For example, you start with a short barreled gun which you can upgrade to either a medium or long barreled gun. Your gun shoots standard bullets but can also fire silver bullets which are stronger than the standard ones.</desc>

		<name>Loopz</name>
		<desc>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.

Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next..</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2284, and the human race has perfected space travel and is colonizing the galaxy. To help out, robots of all types are used in exploring new planets. There are even entire planets dedicated to manufacturing new robots. But then an alien race captured one of the robot manufacturing planets and reprogrammed the robots to destroy humans! Now it's up to you to go in and take back the planet. Using a low gravity backpack, you have the ability to jump higher than normally possible. You also have a wide variety of weapons to help battle the robots guarding the planet, and additional weapons can be found by destroying certain robots.  Some robots will be riding in vehicles. If you destroy the driver, you can capture the vehicle to help you out on your mission.</desc>

		<desc>This is a futuristic pool game, in which the tables are designed in several different shapes and sizes, with pockets sometimes slightly inwards from the cushion. This makes the game more similar to miniature golf than conventional pool. 

You can set the power of each shot, though not the spin. In one-player mode you must clear the table without missing more than more than 3 times. There are 60 different tables, and 255 levels in total to play through in sequence, and you can also alter the friction level. You can also go head to head with another player.</desc>

		<name>M.U.L.E.</name>
		<desc>M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.

You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.

Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.

After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.

After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.

Third phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. 

There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are:
- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it.
- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.
- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).
- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.
- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.
- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.
- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.
- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.

M.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. 

M.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.</desc>

		<name>Mach Rider</name>
		<desc>Mach Rider is a motorcycle combat game set in a post-apocalyptic future. Players, represented by Mach Rider, must make their way across ten sectors to reach the city before it gets taken over by the enemy. Aggressive drivers try to force players off the road; obstacles, such as rocks, and the road's many turns also can cause players to veer off course. If destroyed, Mach Rider will reform himself so that he can continue.

There are three different play modes in Mach Rider.

On the Fighting Course, there are two paths to choose from. The goal must be reached while shooting down enemies or forcing them off the road; more points are rewarded by bumping off enemies. Unlimited lives are available for the first stage, but remaining courses must be finished in three lives or less.

On the Endurance and Solo Courses, there is a certain distance that must be gone before the time runs out. Enemies are on the Endurance Course, but the Solo course is devoid of enemies.

There is also a level editor (similar to the one in Excitebike) that allows creation of Endurance Course tracks, which are erased once the NES is turned off.</desc>

		<desc>Mach Rider is a motorcycle combat game set in a post-apocalyptic future. Players, represented by Mach Rider, must make their way across ten sectors to reach the city before it gets taken over by the enemy. Aggressive drivers try to force players off the road; obstacles, such as rocks, and the road's many turns also can cause players to veer off course. If destroyed, Mach Rider will reform himself so that he can continue.

There are three different play modes in Mach Rider.

On the Fighting Course, there are two paths to choose from. The goal must be reached while shooting down enemies or forcing them off the road; more points are rewarded by bumping off enemies. Unlimited lives are available for the first stage, but remaining courses must be finished in three lives or less.

On the Endurance and Solo Courses, there is a certain distance that must be gone before the time runs out. Enemies are on the Endurance Course, but the Solo course is devoid of enemies.

There is also a level editor (similar to the one in Excitebike) that allows creation of Endurance Course tracks, which are erased once the NES is turned off.</desc>

The game introduction is the speech from the beginning of the movie Mad Max 2 (a.k.a The Road Warrior), telling you how the world ended and how The Road Warrior, lost everything by "the roar of an engine" and how he in the wastelands "learned to live again".
The game is played in a top-down view where you move your car to attack enemy cars and pick up fuel tanks (if run run out of fuel the game is over).</desc>

		<name>The Mafat Conspiracy</name>
		<desc>You play as Golgo 13 aka Duke Togo, ace sharpshooter and assassin. Based off a character of various manga comics, Golgo is a down-to-business man at the end of a gun. Stuck in the world of espionage among such groups as the FBI and the CIA, Golgo is constantly in mortal danger, and a lethal weapon in his own right. 

The Mafat Conspiracy is the sequel to the NES game Top Secret Episode. In this chapter, Golgo must track down a missing satellite from the SDI laser defense system, as well as rescue a top scientist and stop those who would use the satellite for blackmail and terror on the world's nations. 

While Golgo is outdoors, the game is a side-scrolling romp where the player can fire and jump. This changes when Golgo enters a building, at which point the game switches to a first person 3D maze. Navigating past soldiers and between floors, Golgo collects various clues to advance the storyline. There is also a driving sequence, and several sniper sequences in which precision aiming is required.</desc>

		<name>Magic Carpet 1001</name>
		<desc>Magic Carpet 1001 (called "Arabian Nights" in Chinese) is an unlicensed shoot-'em-up developed by Mega Soft (NTDEC) and distributed by NTDEC in 1991, Caltron and Gluk Video in 1992 and Asder in 1993 as part of the Asder 20-in-1 multicart. Its Caltron 6-in-1 incarnation is arguably the most well-known.
The game is a standard NES shoot-'em-up. It is four levels long and mostly takes place in an Arabian setting, with the fourth level being in space. There are many enemies that stand in the way of your character (an Aladdin-type who rides a magic carpet, although the title screen suggests he is a genie) which follow set patterns that become more complex with each level.
As well as this, all four levels have a different boss; a witch, a snake in a flying jar, a giant skull and giant lips respectively, with the latter often being considered to be far too difficult. Numerous power-ups can be collected at random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your character's health. By default, your character starts with 6 lives, dies in one hit and he can only fire one shot on the screen at a time.
Oddly for a shooter, this game does not have a score system whatsoever and the levels progress with the only warning being that the screen fades out after the boss. The ending is a picture of your character and (presumably) the damsel in distress you were rescuing, followed by a credits screen which has some of the names that appear in other Mega Soft games.
This game was later hacked in 1995 to produce Aladdin III, which is identical apart from the title screen which removes the company name and logo, as well as decreasing protagonist's minimal speed. This one appears on several multicarts. It is also unrelated to the Hummer Team pirate.</desc>

		<name>Magic Darts</name>
		<desc>Magic Darts contains six different games of darts; 301, 501, 701, Count Up, Round the Clock and Half It. In the 301, 501, and 701 games you can choose the open or double rules. You can choose to be one of 10 characters (a monkey,alien, and a robot are just some of the choices of characters available). Throwing a dart depends on four different factors: position, curve, angle and power. The game allows up to four players to compete against one another.

In the 301, 501, and 701 games the point is to get the score down to exactly zero.
In Count up, the players compete to see who can achieve the highest score.
In Round the Clock, players must try to hit the numbers one  through twelve in sequential order.
In Half It, players begin with 40 points. Players have three chances to hit the assigned numbers to add to their own score. If the player is unable to hit all assigned numbers, their point total will be cut in half. The player with the highest score wins. The assigned numbers are 16, double ring, 17, 18,triple ring, 19, 20 and the bullseye.</desc>

		<name>Magic Johnson's Fast Break</name>
		<desc>Magic Johnson's Fast Break is fast-paced two-on-two action rather than the usual five-on-five contest. On screen you get a full-court, horizontally-scrolling gameplay. A referee monitors the action and calls the fouls if the gameplay gets too rough, and a crowd cheers you on.

Your team starts each game at a certain salary level. Your goal is to beat the opposition to earn a larger salary. Keep winning and you might etch your name onto the Big Earners Screen. Choose from five skill levels - Rookie to Professional. Each level provides quicker gameplay, tougher defense, and bigger bucks if you win.

Each game lasts four three-minute, real-life quarters. In between quarters, you can review stats such as field goal percentage, three-pointers made, rebounds, and steals. If the score is tied at the final buzzer, you play additional quarters until someone wins.

You control one player at a time. An arrow appears on-screen above the head of the player you're running. Just hit B to switch players. You can play against the computer or up to three friends.</desc>

		<desc>Merlwood was once a land of peace and prosperity. The people lived in harmony with one another and with their surroundings, thanks to the benevolent influence of the native wizards and their magical arts. All was calm until one ambitious wizard named Abadon began to lust for power. Abadon overwhelmed the other wizards, brought evil upon the land, and made himself its master. Only Paul, a young magician's apprentice, was left to oppose him. Can you guide Paul to victory, or will Abadon rule Merlwood forever? 

Magician is a 2D, side-scrolling action RPG. As Paul, you must travel through towns, have conversations with non-player characters, acquire and manage inventory (food, water, weapons, potions, etc.), learn magic spells, fight battles, and solve puzzles. Your ultimate goal: collect each of the four elemental vials -- earth, air, fire, and water -- and combine them to create the Ultimate Potion. Only then can you hope to vanquish the evil wizard Abadon!</desc>

		<desc>Merlwood was once a land of peace and prosperity. The people lived in harmony with one another and with their surroundings, thanks to the benevolent influence of the native wizards and their magical arts. All was calm until one ambitious wizard named Abadon began to lust for power. Abadon overwhelmed the other wizards, brought evil upon the land, and made himself its master. Only Paul, a young magician's apprentice, was left to oppose him. Can you guide Paul to victory, or will Abadon rule Merlwood forever? 

Magician is a 2D, side-scrolling action RPG. As Paul, you must travel through towns, have conversations with non-player characters, acquire and manage inventory (food, water, weapons, potions, etc.), learn magic spells, fight battles, and solve puzzles. Your ultimate goal: collect each of the four elemental vials -- earth, air, fire, and water -- and combine them to create the Ultimate Potion. Only then can you hope to vanquish the evil wizard Abadon!</desc>

		<name>Magmax</name>
		<desc>An alien menace has attacked the worlds of civilization and laid waste to their planets. However before the being conquered, a group of scientists has managed to create one last weapon and hidden it underground. The name of the weapon is Mag Max and only it might be able to defeat the alien invaders. Mag Max however is incomplete and for security reasons, his component parts are scattered across the land. Through their collection, Mag Max's strength increases.

Mag Max is a side-scrolling shooter game. At the beginning, Mag Max is only a tiny little fighter craft that can fire low-powered projectiles. As component pieces are found; such as a head, legs and a laser lance, Mag Max's offensive power increases. Access to the underworld can be granted through small dark craters on the landscape. Once in the underworld, Mag Max's weapons vary slightly as do the enemies (there are no stationary objects underground). Enemy fire or contact on each of the components will destroy that component. Fire on the main fighter will destroy Mag Max. At the end of each level awaits a boss creature.</desc>

		<name>Major League Baseball</name>
		<desc>Baseball game featuring full major league rosters of all 26 teams of the 1987 baseball season.  The players, however, are never identified by name, only by jersey number.  Oddly enough, the statistics for the players are very close to, but not exactly, the same as their real-life counterparts.  Close enough that it is possible to identify who each player is supposed to be, though they are represented only by a position (infield/outfield/catcher/pitcher), a number, and a stat line.

There is no season mode, but you can play a regular season game, an All-Star Game (you pick your own All-Stars from the team rosters), or a World Series.

Before each game begins, you set your lineup and starting pitcher from your chosen team's roster.

Gameplay is the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for pitching and batting, switching to different views after the ball is hit.</desc>

		<name>Makai Island</name>
		<desc>Higemaru Makaijima (Makaijima Nanatsu no Shima Daibouken, lit. Hell Island: Great Adventure of 7 Islands) is an action-adventure game developed for the Famicom and MSX home computer, and released by Capcom in 1987. It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed "Makai Island".
In Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.
Once Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.</desc>

Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.nnnnPlayers start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door").

		<desc>A port of the arcade game. The idea is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</desc>

		<name>Mario Is Missing!</name>
		<desc>Bowser, the token bad guy from the Mario Bros. series, is up to no good again in this educational game designed to teach children geography. This time he's set up his headquarters in Antarctica and created portals to 25 famous cities around the world, so that his Koopas can wreak havoc in our own world. He's also kidnapped Mario, hence the title of this game. You play as Luigi who must foil Bowser's plans by entering through each of the portals, tracking down the Koopas who have stolen famous artifacts, and looking for clues about your location. Once you've set everything right and determined where you are, you call Yoshi on your Globulator so he can track you down. You need Yoshi's help to eat the Pokey (a cactus-like creature) that's guarding the return portal, and when Luigi returns he can close the portal forever.

By exploring these 25 cities, children can familiarize themselves with the landmarks and artifacts that each city has. When Luigi returns the stolen artifacts to the proper places he can even take photographs of them. There is also an add-on disk you can purchase that adds ten additional cities to the game (it originally retailed for $24.95).</desc>

		<desc>This is a compilation cart featuring 15 games. There are 2 versions of this cart. The AVE cart contains the following games:

1. F-15 City War
Puzzle
Pyramid
Tiles of Fate
Krazy Kreatures
Double Strike
Dudes with Attitude
Venice Beach Volleyball
Stakk'M (never released outside of this multicart)
Deathbots
Rad Racket: Deluxe Tennis II
Chiller
Solitaire
Menace Beach
Shockwave

Stakk'M is a Tetris like game that uses falling square blocks with either numerals, hearts, or diamonds patterns on them. The player tries to create either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines of 3 to 5 identical or consecutive numbers to score points and eliminate them from the well. Each level has a goal that must be met in order to move on to the next level. Goals involve completing a set number of horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines, scoring a stated number of points, or eliminating a certain number of blocks at once by using any combination of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines. There are also treasure blocks which act as wild cards and death blocks which can only be eliminated by combining them with other death blocks.

The HES version of this game does away with Pyramid and Double Strike and adds the following games in their place:

1. BlackJack
Death Race

		<desc>This is a compilation cart featuring 15 games. There are 2 versions of this cart. The AVE cart contains the following games:

1. F-15 City War
Puzzle
Pyramid
Tiles of Fate
Krazy Kreatures
Double Strike
Dudes with Attitude
Venice Beach Volleyball
Stakk'M (never released outside of this multicart)
Deathbots
Rad Racket: Deluxe Tennis II
Chiller
Solitaire
Menace Beach
Shockwave

Stakk'M is a Tetris like game that uses falling square blocks with either numerals, hearts, or diamonds patterns on them. The player tries to create either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines of 3 to 5 identical or consecutive numbers to score points and eliminate them from the well. Each level has a goal that must be met in order to move on to the next level. Goals involve completing a set number of horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines, scoring a stated number of points, or eliminating a certain number of blocks at once by using any combination of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines. There are also treasure blocks which act as wild cards and death blocks which can only be eliminated by combining them with other death blocks.

The HES version of this game does away with Pyramid and Double Strike and adds the following games in their place:

1. BlackJack
Death Race

		<name>Mechanized Attack</name>
		<desc>Mechanized Attack is an adaptation of an arcade shooting game where the player uses a machine gun to stage an assault on a tropical island that's home to a cyborg army. In this NES port, the player can use either a gamepad or the NES Light Zapper to carry out the mission. Battle through numerous stages beginning with an approach to the island. This first stage is held over the water and features at attack on a number of small gunboats, a helicopter, and an entire battleship. As the player progresses through the stages of the island, the human (and even canine) enemies are revealed to be robots when the flesh is destroyed. At various junctures of the game, the player is allowed to choose which game path to pursue.

While the arcade version of Mechanized Attack had a miniature machine gun replica for the player to use, this NES adaptation attempts to reproduce the feel by allowing the player to hold down a game pad button or the Light Zapper trigger for automatic fire. Extra ammo is plentiful so be sure to fire at those power-up boxes to grab as much as you can. There are also more powerful grenades which are in much shorter supply than the bullets.</desc>

		<desc>In the future city of Monsteropolis, the use of robot labour has helped civilization grow more than ever before. At the forefront of this technology is Dr. Light and his assistant Dr. Wily, who are commissioned to build six robots to handle a variety of specific tasks. They are named Bombman, Gutsman, Iceman, Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman in reference to their individual prime functions. Dr. Wily, however, has bigger plans and chooses to take control of the robots and let loose destruction in a bid for world control. Dr. Light fights back with the best tool he has, an experimental human-like robot, Rock aka Mega Man, who had been tested to perform cleaning duties. Now properly armed, it's up to Mega Man to take on the maverick robots, fight his way into Dr. Wily's castle, and end this madness.</desc>

Dr. Wily has escaped from prison and is madder than ever, this time creating eight new Robot Masters of his own to take over the world and crush Mega Man!  Is the world doomed?

Mega Man 2 is the sequel to the NES game Mega Man. In this game, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man and Wood Man are Dr. Wily's eight prize creations that have been sent to take over the world.  As Mega Man defeats these bosses, he can steal their powers and use them for himself.  Each Robot Master is weak against another's weapon, and through experimentation, Mega Man can gain the upper hand by using the weapon they're vulnerable against.

Other additions to the game include the 'E-Tank' - an item that can be used at any time to completely refill Mega Man's energy, and a Password System, which allows players to continue their game by recording which Robot Masters have been defeated and how many E-Tanks they have.  Mega Man 2 also removes the scoring system from the original game.</desc>

		<desc>"Calling Mega Man! Calling Mega Man! Come in please! ...."

This is a traditional action-platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Also, there is a mysterious character called Protoman who may or may not be your friend.

Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.

How do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels, even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows: Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, &amp; Hard Man.

Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find.

This is a traditional action-platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Also, there is a mysterious character called Protoman who may or may not be your friend.

Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.

How do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels, even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows: Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, &amp; Hard Man.

Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. And, of course, you do get infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.</desc>

		<desc>In Mega Man 4, Dr. Wily is declared as having been killed by the explosion of Gamma. A year passes and Rock, Roll, and Dr. Light are living in peace. But soon, the peace is broken by a new threat.

A supposed colleague of Dr. Light's, the mysterious Dr. Cossack, has sent out eight of his own Robot Masters to find Mega Man, whom Cossack blames for the kidnapping of his daughter. Mega Man, hoping to clear his name, sets out to find Dr. Cossack, this time armed with a powerful new weapon: the Rock Buster!!

Rockman must now battle with Cossack's fiendish Robot Masters and find Cossack's daughter before it's too late!

Originally for the NES, Mega Man 4 was also released for the PSX in Japan as the fourth installment in the Rockman Complete Works series.</desc>

		<desc>Dr. Cossack, humbled by his defeat and his allowing of Dr. Wily to influence his ways, decides to help Dr. Light by providing him and Rockman with tools and weapons to help foil Dr. Wily for good. All seems calm and peaceful, until...

A sudden rampage breaks out, and the cause is found to be a group of robots, led by a mysterious figure. As Dr. Light begins to investigate this rampage and attempts to find a way to stop it, he is kidnapped by the leader of the robots. Rockman hurries to save Dr. Light, but is too late...the only thing he can find at the scene is a yellow scarf...one that almost seems to belong to...Blues!?

Could Rockman's supposed brother, the strange but good-hearted Blues, be the one who kidnapped Dr. Light? Is Blues the one responsible for the rampages? With these questions racing through his mind, Rockman sets off to find Blues and get the answers he wants.

Like the other early Rockman / Mega Man games, the Playstation version was only released in Japan, as part of the Complete Works series.</desc>

To help, and sometime hinder you, a man randomly throws ketchup bottles, wrenches, and bombs out of widows and random holes in the sewer walls. These items can be picked up and thrown at your enemies to defeat them far better than your fists ever will.</desc>

		<name>Mermaids of Atlantis : The Riddle of the Magic Bubble</name>
		<desc>Mermaids of Atlantis is a censored localization of the formerly pornographic game Bubble Bath Babes (also known as Magic Bubble or Soap Panic) with all nudity removed. Instead of showing erotic images after stages are cleared, this version of the game has cutscenes describing how the greedy emperor O-Dinten sealed the merpeople's games in protective bubbles and forces them pay licensing fees. You must solve puzzles to unlock the games, as an allegory of the real-life situation with Nintendo's lockout chip making it difficult to release unlicensed games for the NES.

The gameplay is reminiscent of that of Tetris and Puzzle Bobble in that the goal is to steer clusters of rising bubbles and place them so that they connect to other bubbles of similar color along the top of the screen. If the sufficient number of similar bubbles are touching, they will be cleared and all free neighboring bubbles will rise further, allowing for combos. If the accumulated bubbles on screen reach the bottom of the playing area, the game is over. If a level is completed, the player will be rewarded with erotica.

The game is very difficult to find and is sought after by collectors, often topping prices of $1000 U.S. Dollars on auction sites such as eBay.</desc>

		<desc>Metal Fighter is an arcade style shooter for one player. You control an MCS-920 in an attempt to free planet H17 from alien invaders. Along the way you can improve your fighters weapons and speed by shooting certain enemies and collecting the power ups left behind. Improved weapons don't come easy though; each time you collect a weapon power up you will need to fight another metal fighter and win to be able to claim the new weapon. Each of the numerous, colorful levels contains a variety of enemies trying to stop you, along with a large boss at the end that will need to be defeated before moving on.</desc>

		<desc>Metal Storm is an action game in which the player takes control of the giant mecha M-308 Gunner in order to put a stop to a malfunctioning computer menace. 

To save it from becoming another generic action game, innovation is shown through fast paced gameplay and the "gravity flip" ability, which enables the character to freely switch between moving along the floor or ceiling. While the game is only seven levels long, the difficulty ramps up quickly, so mastery of the gravity technique and memorization of the levels become absolute necessities for survival.</desc>

You're inside the fortress planet Zebes. The planet of endless secret passageways where the Metroid are multiplying. Left alone the Metroid are harmless. But in the wrong hands they could destroy the galaxy. It's up to you to prevent the Mother Brain that controls Zebes from using the Metroid for evil purposes. But that won't be easy. You'll have to use your spacesuit to absorb valuable energy for your search to gain the use of power items like the Ice Beam, Wave Beam, High Jump Boots and Varia. If you survive, it will be you and your acquired powers against the Mother Brain.</desc>

		<desc>Michael Andretti's World GP features 16 unique courses located in Brazil, San Marino, Monaco, Mexico, Canada, 
United States, France, England, West Germany, Hungary, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Japan, and Australia. Each track can be played either in single player mode or in head-to-head 2-player action on a split screen. There are 4 different cars to choose from and manual shifting is a consideration during racing, a facet often overlooked in simpler NES racing game scenarios. While the star of the game is Michael Andretti, who pops in before each race to offer useful advice about the current track, the game also has appearances by many other F-1 racing stars.</desc>

		<desc>One of Mickey's friends is in trouble, and Mickey and Minnie Mouse are on a rescue mission! Mickey Mousecapade is an action platform game. In order to reach your goal (and find out which of Mickey's friends is in trouble), you'll need to jump and climb your way through various levels which take place in different locations (including a fun house, a treacherous sea side, a pirate ship, and a castle). Each screen has numerous obstacles and enemies which will drain your energy if you come in contact; lose all of your energy, and a life is lost and the game ends when you have no lives left. You control Mickey Mouse and Minnie follows along. You'll need to make sure Minnie stays safe as you make your way through the levels (for example, if you mistime a jump and Mickey lands safely but Minnie doesn't a life will be lost). In addition to avoiding obstacles, there is also some occasional puzzle solving (such as locating a key to open locked doors, or finding your way out of the woods).</desc>

		<name>Mickey's Safari in Letterland</name>
		<desc>Mickey's Safari In Letterland chronicles Mickey Mouse's globetrotting adventures (on a slightly modified globe) to capture letters for educational purposes. Goofy assists with chauffeur and data processing duties. Mickey can venture into any of the following 6 territories: Yukon, Swamp, Forest, Jungle, Pyramid, and Caribbean. In each area, his mission is to collect three diamonds that contain letters. Doing so will spell a word. Then, Mickey ventures to the end of the level and collects a large slab. If Mickey collects the three diamonds in the stage to spell a 3-letter word, Mickey spells the word with digitized audio samples and says the word, complete with an illustration. Then, the slab that Mickey collected at the end of the stage is fed by Goofy through a large machine that spits out a letter. It is up to the player to identify which letter this is.

This game is oriented towards very young children. As such, it is essentially impossible to fail. There are many enemies in the game but none actually inflict harm. Snakes, porcupines, hippos, alligators, and even baby seals-- Mickey just bounces off each. Mickey can also swim handily and sustain long falls.

Further, the game allows the player to point at letters on a board and have Mickey say them using the cartridge's library of digitized mouse voice samples.</desc>

		<desc>The closest comparison to this action game would be Afterburner, a game which was overdue a decent home computer re-creation. You view the game slightly behind your plane, which must shoot out enemy planes, tanks and installations while avoiding their fire. You are armed with different kinds of weapons including downward bombs, air-to-air missiles and a nuclear bomb. More of each of these can be picked up by collecting the parachutes which are dropped into your path. There are mountain ranges, deserts and arctic scenes to clear along the way, with big boss planes to face.</desc>

		<name>Might &amp; Magic : Secret of the Inner Sanctum</name>
		<desc>In Might and Magic, the player controls a party of adventurers in a medieval world called Varn. Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Your task is to find the real king and ultimately to stop the alien invasion into Varn.

This is the first game in the  Might and Magic series, and one of the prototypes of role-playing games in general. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. The player creates a party of six adventurers, with traditional classes to choose from (fighter, cleric, etc.). The player also specifies the gender and the age of the characters - they grow old and will eventually die of natural causes. As in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world, performing quests, and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The turn-based battles typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain.</desc>

Once again you play as the bomb-hungry caped superhero. Collect the bombs for points and avoid being touched by the different monsters that spawn from crates and the like.

The game now features new scenarios like clouds and forests, as well as the usual sphinx and pyramids backgrounds of the original title.</desc>

		<name>Mighty Final Fight</name>
		<desc>Capcom's only 8-bit port of the Final Fight series, Mighty Final Fight follows the storyline and characters of the first Final Fight game. Mayor of Metro City Mike Haggar, his ninja friend Guy and his daughter's boyfriend, Cody learn that Haggar's daughter, Jessica,  has been kidnapped by the Mad Gear Gang whose leader has fallen in love with her, and also wants the meddling Mike Haggar to leave town. Now it's personal! Choosing one of the three fighters, the player embarks on a beat-em-up quest through the streets of Metro City.

The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up and a one-player only game (unlike other Final Fight ports). Also exclusive to this particular Final Fight game is the experience system which allows gaining levels to learn additional moves, similar to the first Double Dragon game. The characters have all been squished down to super-deformed 8-bit likenesses.  Graphically this looks similar to River City Ransom. Each character has a button for attack and a button for jumping. Pressing the two together unleashes a character-specific super-move. Various grabbing moves and throws can also be done by moving the player near an enemy.</desc>

Power Punch 2 is a one-on-one boxing game à la Punch Out, in which you control Mark as he battles all of the alien contenders in hopes of getting the galactic boxing belt. The game is played from a 3rd person perspective from which you see both fighters as they fight. You have rudimentary movement controls but the basic mechanics involve dodging and timing your attacks so that you can break the enemies patterns. Between fights you get to train in a gym, which involve taking part in a series of mini-games with the rewards being upgraded strength, speed or health for you upcoming bout.</desc>

		<desc>Mike Tyson's Punch-Out is one of the most popular and biggest selling video games of all time. Step into the ring as Little Mac, a 17-year-old fighter from the Bronx, ranked number three in the minor circuit. Your goal is to work your way up through the rankings so that you can challenge Mike Tyson, Kid Dynamite, in a dream fight. 

But the road to the championship is long and hard. You'll have to work your way up through the minor, major, and world circuits by winning against tough contestants like Piston Honda, Glass Joe, Super Macho Man and many, many more! Defeat all your opponents and meet the ultimate challenge against the World Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson in the greatest fight of all - The Dream Bout! Knockout Tyson and you can become WVBA (World Video Boxing Association) Champ!

The rules of the World Video Boxing Association govern your bouts. Each match is three three-minute rounds long. Any boxer knocked down for a 10 count is Knocked Out (KO). If a boxer goes down three times, he'll find himself a Technical Knock Out (TKO). If both boxers make it to the end of the third round, the ref determines the winner. 

Once you're in the ring you'll have to beat your opponent with smart fighting. Use left and right punches, as well as uppercuts to knock your opponent to the mat. Dodge your opponent's blows with some fancy footwork. Dazzle them with your brilliance and you'll be the World Video Boxing Association Champion. On the other hand, you might find yourself down for the count.</desc>

The rules of the World Video Boxing Association govern your bouts. Each match is three three-minute rounds long. Any boxer knocked down for a 10 count is Knocked Out (KO). If a boxer goes down three times, he'll find himself a Technical Knock Out (TKO). If both boxers make it to the end of the third round, the ref determines the winner. 

Once you're in the ring you'll have to beat your opponent with smart fighting. Use left and right punches, as well as uppercuts to knock your opponent to the mat. Dodge your opponent's blows with some fancy footwork. Dazzle them with your brilliance and you'll be the World Video Boxing Association Champion. On the other hand, you might find yourself down for the count.</desc>

		<name>Millipede</name>
		<desc>Millipedes, cousins of the Centipede, are all over the garden. This will ruin anything trying to grow there unless they are stopped. But there are other insects as well; spiders, bees, dragonflies and earwigs. Nature is dangerous. Luckily, there's a bug zapper that can shoot arrows at these insects and destroy them.

Millipede is the sequel to Centipede, and features similar gameplay, but with a new swarm of insects! The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen. When all millipede segments have been destroyed, the player will progress to the next, more difficult level. Millipedes and other creatures are all worth a different amount of points. Occasionally dynamite will appear on the screen, which will explode if shot by the bug zapper. With a well timed shot, numerous millipede segments (and other insects as well) can be taken out as they pass by.</desc>

		<desc>Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to rescue Dr. O and Shannon from the grubby clutches of the Sinister Seven as quickly as possible.  

As you fight your way through each area, you must obtain information and vital ID cards.  Your progress is blocked at every turn by acid flames, raw sewage, scorching steam, high voltage electricity and poison gas.

You can choose from three agents, Max, Grant and Nicholas, according to the situation at hand.  Each is equipped with two types of weapons which can be interchanged according to the surroundings.

If an agent's life gauge runs out the next agent in line will take his place.  If you complete an area successfully then the knocked-out agents will rejoin the team at the beginning of the next area.

The game is made up of six areas with the first and last consisting of two stages.  Two of the areas auto-scroll with all three agents in play at once.

This game will self destruct in five seconds.</desc>

		<name>Monster in My Pocket</name>
		<desc>The evil Warlock wants to take over the world! He calls his fellow monsters to join him, but several refuse - and after casting a shrinking spell that backfires and shrinks down all the monsters around him, transporting them to different homes in Los Angeles.

Warlock didn't let his size impairment get in the way of world domination, however, so it's up to The Vampire and The Monster to stop him! Along the way, both characters will have to fight through Warlock's henchmonsters through the streets, sewers, a construction area and even a Japanese garden.

The game features classic platforming action. The player only has one all-purpose attack and they can also double jump to avoid enemies or reach high ledges. The player can also pick up small objects and use them to attack several enemies at once. If there's only one player, they can choose between The Vampire or The Monster. Or if they don't want to go alone, a friend can join in and help them beat Warlock in the two player co-op mode.

The game is based on the Monster In My Pocket toy franchise. The package also included a limited edition Monster in My Pocket toy, Blemmyea (#81), which was only available with this game.</desc>

		<desc>You are a young boy with a baseball bat named Mark. On your way home from a baseball game, you encounter a monster named Bert. Bert needs your help in saving his planet from the evil monsters. You learn how to fuse with Bert and become a monster fighting gargoyle. You'll spend most of the game attacking bad guys by swinging your bat at them or volleying their fire.

This is a side scrolling adventure, similar in play to Super Mario Bros., but with monsters and skulls. The game itself is infamous for its outlandish quotes.</desc>

		<name>Monster Truck Rally</name>
		<desc>Take the wheel of a monster truck through nine different events at a time or choose the rally and go through all of them. The nine events are hill climb, drag race, bog, car crush, tug-o-war, sled pull, draw bridge, donuts and the combo course.

In the hill climb, players race on a track comprised mainly of steep hills. The drag race event offers drag racing down a long straight way. The bog event is a race on a track with numerous watery bogs throughout its path. In the car crush event, the player races up and down straight roadways, driving over rows of cars that are lined up for the monster truck to crush. In the tug-o-war competition, the player's truck and the one of the opponent are tied together, facing opposite directions, and the player has to tug the other across the line that is on your own side behind hum. The sled pull has the player drive along a straight path while pulling a weighted sled. While progressing, more weight is added, slowing the truck down. The draw bridge course features drawbridges that go up and down. If the bridge is down, the truck can pass, if it is up, the player has to wait until it comes back down to continue. Donut features races around a small donut-shaped track against an opponent. The combo course event involves all the previous events thrown in throughout a race,

Players can also create your own track or have the game create one at random.</desc>

		<desc>A simple, top-down driving game where you play a patrol officer in a city police force. You progressively take down bigger bad guys by chasing them down and shooting at them. The gameplay is a precursor to the first Grand Theft Auto games, developed later.

Gameplay consists of driving your squad car around the city, pulling over speeders, by flashing the siren, and stopping random robberies, by shooting the getaway car.  Larger crimes will pop up, which lead to capturing whoever the current Public Enemy No. 1 is.  The game ends when you fail in a mission, or when you total your police cruiser.</desc>

		<desc>Mr. Gimmick is a little doll with a life of its own, that's given to a girl for her birthday. The girl's other toys quickly become jealous of the attention given to Mr. Gimmick, and they decide to carry her away to a mystical land. Mr. Gimmick goes after them to bring his owner back. 

The game Mr. Gimmick is a platform game where you take control of Mr. Gimmick over the course of six levels. You defend yourself by throwing bouncing stars that take a second to form and are then thrown downward. You can also ride the stars thrown to gain access to higher platforms. The inventory you have allows you to store bombs, potions, and fireballs.

The game has two endings. The easier way is to just run through all of the levels. Each level has a treasure hidden that can be a bit difficult to get, and finding all of these gives access to an extra level. But if you lose all of your lives and have to continue, the game will take all of your treasures away, and not allow you to get to the final level.</desc>

		<desc>Mr. Gimmick is a little doll with a life of its own, that's given to a girl for her birthday. The girl's other toys quickly become jealous of the attention given to Mr. Gimmick, and they decide to carry her away to a mystical land. Mr. Gimmick goes after them to bring his owner back. 

The game Mr. Gimmick is a platform game where you take control of Mr. Gimmick over the course of six levels. You defend yourself by throwing bouncing stars that take a second to form and are then thrown downward. You can also ride the stars thrown to gain access to higher platforms. The inventory you have allows you to store bombs, potions, and fireballs.

The game has two endings. The easier way is to just run through all of the levels. Each level has a treasure hidden that can be a bit difficult to get, and finding all of these gives access to an extra level. But if you lose all of your lives and have to continue, the game will take all of your treasures away, and not allow you to get to the final level.</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-man (Namco)</name>
		<desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".</desc>

		<name>Ms. Pac-man (Tengen)</name>
		<desc>The conversions of Ms. Pac-Man which were developed by Tengen contained the original game as well as many upgrades, such as the choice between original, small, large or strange mazes, optional or obligatory use of speed booster, alternating or simultaneous 2 player games, difficult selection, and the option to continue a limited number of times. Any maze that is too large to fit on the screen scrolls vertically. Unlike the arcade version, each variation ends after round 32. There is also a fourth intermission called "The End", where Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man wave goodbye to the player, and the game ends. Finally, although there is an "arcade" mode on the NES/Sega Master System versions, the third maze has extra pellets on both the left and right sides of it, which are not present in the original arcade version. The Genesis/SNES versions of the game do not have these pellets, and are arcade accurate as a result.</desc>

		<name>Muppet Adventure : Chaos at the Carnival</name>
		<desc>Chaos at the Carnival is a collection of six arcade mini-games.

Miss Piggy has been "pignapped" by the sinister Dr. Grump; her Muppet friends come to the rescue. Kermit, Gonzo, Fozzie and three other characters from the children's TV show dash into Grump's mysterious fun fair in search for their pink companion. They must brave five rides in succession in order to take on the Grumpasaurus in the final carnival confrontation.

1. Tunnel of Love: Avoid objects in the waterway
2. Duck Hunt: Hit passing ducks with tomatoes
3. Space Ride: Land a spaceship in the correct dock using rocket blasts
4. Bumper Cars: Race around the track and avoid crashing into obstacles
5. Funhouse: Find a way through a small maze filled with guard dogs
6. Battle of the Grumpasaurus: Tickle the Grumpasaurus so that he laughs himself silly

The C-64, Apple II and DOS versions of Chaos at the Carnival support two players, taking turns.

The versions for the four platforms differ strongly; see the trivia section for details.</desc>

		<desc>Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.

Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.

More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?</desc>

		<desc>In NES Open Tournament Golf, you can play a round of golf on one of three different courses. One or two players can play in the U.S., Japan, or the U.K. and choose a stroke or match play game. Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook. If you are unable to finish a round in one play, NES Open Tournament Golf features a battery back-up allowing you to save the game and continue later.</desc>

		<desc>Nintendo takes its game to the gridiron with NES Play Action Football.  While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season.  You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.

Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen.  Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run.  The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from.  The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.

Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains.  Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play.  Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!</desc>

		<desc>NES Virus Cleaner is pretty much a spoof of the NES Cleaning Kit. That thing barely helped clean the NES, just as NES Virus Cleaner doesn't do much for removing ?viruses? from your NES. You guide Clik, the hero, around inside your NES and grab viruses in the various spots they are placed. The ultimate goal is to get to the lockout chip and destroy Virii, the main virus. The obstacles in the game are electric bolts, electric sparks, disappearing blocks, a homing missile system, and of course, time. If you run out of time on a certain level, the game is over. If you get hit by an enemy, you will respawn at the point where you picked up the last virus. It's a pretty simple concept overall. I tried to cover everything in the tutorial, but I did in fact miss the part about respawning at the last picked up virus. Oh well, things happen!</desc>

		<name>New Ghostbusters 2</name>
		<desc>New Ghostbusters II follows loosely the original Ivan Reitman's film plot. You start out by selecting two ghostbusters out of  five (The 5th one is Louis Tully). The first, player controlled buster will use proton pack and second, controlled by AI, uses the trap where ghosts end up, after been freezed by using the proton pack. Player controlled buster can get hurt, if touched by a ghost, while AI buster can't. 

The game's perspective is Top-Down, where you move from a one room to another and get rid of ghosts. The type of ghosts vary. After every level you have to fight against a boss, usually someone from the movie. For example, in the first courthouse level you fight against the Scoleri brothers. 

The game contains six levels, inspired by the movie:The Courthouse
2. Subways
3. Apartment
4. The Underground
5. The Museum of Art
6. Vigo's Altar</desc>

		<name>NFL</name>
		<desc>Based on professional football as played in the National Football League, NFL was the first 8-bit console game to carry the official NFL license. There is no NFLPA license, though, which means the 28 real teams are included, but no player names or faces.

The player is in control of the action from a side-scrolling perspective. The camera also zooms in for closeups on receiving plays. However, NFL is also a very strategic, coaching-oriented take on the sport, featuring large playbooks (team plays are included on a separate fold-out sheet bundled with the game manual, but not onscreen in the game itself), limited customization of team skills, and penalties.</desc>

Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.</desc>

		<name>A Nightmare on Elm Street</name>
		<desc>LJN's NES version of the classic horror series casts the player as a teen searching the houses on Elm Street for Freddy Krueger's bones. Once they are all collected, they must be thrown into the high school  furnace to destroy Freddy once and for all (a plot similar to 1987's A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors).

Nightmare has two worlds. In the red-tinted "real world," players fight snakes and spiders while navigating standard platform challenges. The players here have a "sleep meter" that depletes with every hit taken. If the player's sleep meter drops to empty, the game transitions into the blue-tinted "dream world," where enemies take on the appearance of skeletons and ghosts. An invisible timer also starts, counting down until Freddy appears and forces the player into a brief boss battle. The sleep meter becomes a standard life gauge in the dream world, and deducts a life from the player if drained.

Players can find and collect three different icons in the dream world to become "Dream Warriors" with special powers and projectile attacks - both of which give a significant edge when fighting Freddy. Collecting all the bones in a level takes the player to a final level boss, usually taking the form of a monster with Freddy's face or trademark razor glove. Players move back and forth down Elm Street, and a new house opens up as the previous one is cleared.

Nightmare is compatible with the NES Four Score accessory, allowing up to four players to play at once using the same screen.</desc>

Nightshade is a humorous adventure game, with a menu that allows the protagonist to perform various actions, such as look, take, talk, etc. Also included are some one-on-one fight scenes, which differ from the standard controls and in which Nightshade is able to jump, kick, punch and duck.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Crusaders</name>
		<desc>In Ninja Crusaders, a force of alien invaders has descended upon the earth and has wiped out humanity for the most part. Some ninjas survived the onslaught, however, and 2 ninjas in particular named Blade and Talon are assigned to rid the earth of this alien menace.

Ninja Crusaders is a side-scrolling action game that can be played alone or with 2 players fighting side by side. A ninja player can jump quite high and begins the game with a ninja throwing star weapon that can travel the length of the screen, although it's not very powerful. Other weapons are available for the taking throughout the levels, each with considerably less range than the stars but with more power. These weapons include a chain whip, a sword, and a bo staff. Battle your way past vistas of a post-apocalyptic world but try not to get hit because one enemy strike will take care of your ninja.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Gaiden</name>
		<desc>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which 2 ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Gaiden III : The Ancient Ship of Doom</name>
		<desc>This is the third entry in the series of fast-paced ninja action games, and is the last game in the series to be released on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Some time has passed since the defeat of Ashtar and the resurrected Jaquio, and Irene Lew has received a new mission to complete. She is to observe a strange factory that has been constructed recently for an unknown purpose, and investigate it. She proceeds to reconnoiter it, but is intercepted and apparently assassinated by her friend Ryu Hayabusa...except it isn't Ryu. It is an imposter. The real Ryu, angered over her death, and the subsequent false accusation that he murdered her, continues her mission and proceeds to investigate the factory.

As stated, this was the last game in the regular series produced for the NES. It had many features the previous games in the series did not, such as a power up to extend the length of your sword, a new vertical "wave" attack and vertically-scrolling levels. The US version of the game is reputed to be the hardest in the series, due to the extra damage incurred when hit, slightly shorter regular sword length, limited continues and more enemies.

The Lynx port is the second Ninja Gaiden game on the platform, the first being a port from the Arcade Version. This port is identical to the NES game, but the in-game picture is compressed for the smaller screen of the Lynx.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Gaiden III : The Ancient Ship of Doom</name>
		<desc>This is the third entry in the series of fast-paced ninja action games, and is the last game in the series to be released on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Some time has passed since the defeat of Ashtar and the resurrected Jaquio, and Irene Lew has received a new mission to complete. She is to observe a strange factory that has been constructed recently for an unknown purpose, and investigate it. She proceeds to reconnoiter it, but is intercepted and apparently assassinated by her friend Ryu Hayabusa...except it isn't Ryu. It is an imposter. The real Ryu, angered over her death, and the subsequent false accusation that he murdered her, continues her mission and proceeds to investigate the factory.

As stated, this was the last game in the regular series produced for the NES. It had many features the previous games in the series did not, such as a power up to extend the length of your sword, a new vertical "wave" attack and vertically-scrolling levels. The US version of the game is reputed to be the hardest in the series, due to the extra damage incurred when hit, slightly shorter regular sword length, limited continues and more enemies.

The Lynx port is the second Ninja Gaiden game on the platform, the first being a port from the Arcade Version. This port is identical to the NES game, but the in-game picture is compressed for the smaller screen of the Lynx.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Jajamaru-kun</name>
		<desc>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. 

Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.

In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.

As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.

Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.

The items in this game are:

1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.

2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!

3. Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.

4. Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.

5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.
2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!

6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.

7. Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Kid</name>
		<desc>Ninja Kid is a side-scrolling action game in which the eponymous kid must jump and shoot his way through a series of different levels in order to complete his quest. The assorted levels include the Poison Field, Guerrila Warfare, and Blazing Inferno. While armed with ninja bullets by default, he occasionally has the opportunity to pick up other offensive items such as ninja stars, boomerangs, or fireballs. Enemies obstructing Ninja Kid's quest include rolling eyeballs, crows, flying demons, Frankenstein monsters, and of course, other ninjas.

The game begins in an overhead map that allows the player to wander into various side-scrolling levels. The levels go on an on until the player completes a particular task that makes a door appear. Going through the door sometimes leads outside to the overhead map and sometimes leads to a boss battle.

In Japan, this game was known as Gegege no Kitaro: Yokaidaimakyo, based on an animated TV series.</desc>

		<name>Nintendo World Championships 1990</name>
		<desc>This is the cartridge that was used for the Nintendo World Championships held in 1990 in 30 cities across the U.S. and Canada. The player has a total of 6-7 minutes to play all three games but this can be changed by DIP switches on the cartridge.

The first game played is a version of Super Mario Bros. in which the player is given 99 lives and the goal of collecting 50 coins in the first level. Upon collecting the 50th coin, the "finished the castle" music will play and a score will be displayed.

The second game played is Course 1 of Rad Racer, using the 328 Twin Turbo vehicle. The player must finish the course as quickly as possible. No clock is shown in the game but the cartridge keeps track internally. After finishing Rad Racer, its score is displayed, multiplied by 10 and added to the previous Super Mario Bros. score.

Last up is Nintendo's Tetris in A-type mode. All remaining time for the Championship is played out here. The player's objective is simply to get the best score. The Tetris score is multiplied by 25 and added to the previous Super Mario Bros. and Rad Racer scores.

After all the time runs out, a screen will display "Time!" and display the final score, a sum of the previous scores and their multipliers.</desc>

		<name>Nintendo World Cup</name>
		<desc>This soccer game was made at the time when Nintendo introduced their four player adapter, and was probably made for the four playing purpose. This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability.

When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.

In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.</desc>

		<desc>Noah has been commanded by God to put two of each animal aboard his ark to save them from the flood. However unhappy people from around the world have captured different animal species, preventing Noah from doing his job. Noah will need to visit these different locations and free the animals from the people holding them captive.

Noah's Ark is a side scrolling action game. The player, as Noah, must choose which level from several world locations to play. Once in a level, Noah can move left right, duck, jump and fire pellets directly in front of him. These pellets can be used to defeat enemy creatures and uncover hidden items. At the end of each level, Noah will encounter a stronger enemy creature who must be defeated. Noah's ultimate goal is to rescue the designated captive animals listed for each level.</desc>

		<name>Nobunaga's Ambition</name>
		<desc>In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes.  Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</desc>

		<name>Nobunaga's Ambition II</name>
		<desc>Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment.</desc>

		<name>Nomolos</name>
		<desc>Nomolos: Storming the CATsle is a homebrew 2D side-scrolling platformer starring a cat in armour called Nomolos. The story starts when two cats, Solomon and Snow, are playing together when a portal suddenly appears. A giant purple arm shoots out from it and yanks Snow inside. Solomon follows right away and is transported, becoming the feline warrior Nomolos in the process. Going through twelve levels (with an additional hidden bonus level / warp zone) Nomolos pursues the purple enemy that is brining snow to the CATsle.

In addition to the platforming there are many enemy types and three weapons, both melee and ranged. Power-ups can also be found and picking up a mouse restores a heart. The game contains five boss encounters and there are three difficulty levels selected from the main menu. The game music contains chiptune renditions of famous classical music composers.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the Belgian comic book, "Les Tuniques Bleues", this strategy game allows you to replay the American Civil War from both the North and the South sides.

In the strategy part of the game, you can move your troops on a map of the US. If two opposing armies enter the same state, the battle is played out in an action sequence. Additional action sequences must be accomplished when capturing an enemy fort or train.

The game also offers a two-player-mode.</desc>

It is a "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades.  Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds.
You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, ... Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough.
Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

		<name>Orb 3D</name>
		<desc>The evil space wizard Krohn has mastered the power to control a black hole, and plans on using this power to control the universe. You are an explorer on assignment in a remote corner of the universe. You have just been reassigned to fight Krohn since your ship, the Millennium Orb, is the only space craft cabable of withstanding Krohn's black hole. To defeat Krohn, you must get past 30 different chambers blocking the path. On the left and right side of each chamber are force fields which you must maneuver to keep the Millennium orb within the chamber. Each chamber contains a plane in the center with various targets, around which the Orb will travel. You can make the Orb dive out of it's orbital path into the plane and hit the targets. To complete each chamber you need to complete a goal with the targets (often you will need to figure out a way to clear them all.) The Millenium Orb has a limited amount of feul, however, which will be used up over time and in even greater quantities should you miss the Orb with the force fields. When fuel is low, you can head to Vern's Orb-O-Rama and use earned credits to refuel your Orb. 

Included with the game is a pair of 3-D glasses which can give the game a more 3 dimensional appearance, though they aren't required for gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>Othello is a conversion of the board game. Each player tries to fill the game board with as many discs of his color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the board by selecting a location where the  opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The trapped discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out, and the player with the greatest number of his color discs on the board wins. Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.</desc>

		<name>Overlord</name>
		<desc>Overlord is a real-time strategic warfare game where the player must manage large standing armies, economic capital, and political stability throughout a number of extra-dimensional star systems. 

As the dictatorial ruler of the Epsilon Galaxy, the player has obtained complete, indisputable authority. However, during a scientific experiment in hyperdrive technology, Epsilon scientists discovered four "buffer" dimensions, each containing a number of barren planets that exist between the Epsilon Galaxy and another alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these alternate dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own experiments. The player must battle these alien species for control of these buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the Epsilon Galaxy remains intact.

To make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase terraforming equipment which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque worlds which are ideal for agriculture, mineral-rich and heavily volcanic worlds, desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, or ecologically balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily able to generate significant income through taxation. In addition, the player can mine for resources and tax their citizens to raise money, construct spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and equip them, buy battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The player can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The end goal is to ensure that the other alien races do not gain the upper hand by conquering these four new dimensions before the player can.

The player cannot retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the hyperspace link from their universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the player's homeworld, which is where the hyperspace generator is located. Politically (at the very least), this is not an option.

Blood will have to be shed for supremacy of the hyperspace planets, and for the player to become Overlord of these four new dimensions plus their own.</desc>

		<name>P'radikus Conflict</name>
		<desc>One day, the peaceful nation of the Lextorians discovers the planet P'radikus, where numerous uncivilized tribes are constantly at war with one another. When they steal a spaceship and start to expand their wars across the solar systems, you are trained by the elders to halt their dominance and destroy the home planet with a secret weapon known as "Thunderbolt".

Using the typical thrust movement from the Asteroids games, you roam space with your starship to return the peace by force. Starting as a rookie, many enemy ships need to be destroyed to earn credits that can be exchanged for fuel, armor, weapons, shields and warp drives. The commander instructs you with specific missions, such as destroying outposts or freeing alien groups. However, your ultimate goal is to find the Toson Drive, the only device powerful enough to reach P'radikus. To spice things up, there are many weapons such as shock waves, mines, missiles, cloaking devices and atomic cannons. As your fuel constantly depletes, you often need to orbit new planets to refuel and stock weapons.</desc>

		<desc>The enemy is unstoppable. They maintain vigilant guard over their front lines! The only way to defeat them is to get behind their lines. But how? By allowing a soldier to get captured, perhaps he could escape and single-handedly defeat the enemy forces in his way. 

In P.O.W., the player is a soldier who has been imprisoned in a Prisoner of War camp and must escape. In order to accomplish this, he must defeat a variety of enemies.  The foes will attack you hand-to-hand, with knives, guns, and from helicopters. Boss enemies will guard the end of each level.

To fight back, you can use hand-to-hand, and pick up weapon power-ups, found on the ground, in rooms, or dropped by enemies. These weapons include a knife, which can be used to stab or be thrown, guns and grenades.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Land is a side-scrolling 1-2 player game with a cartoony feel to it. Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man Championship Edition</name>
		<desc>Like the original Pac-Man, the basic game play of Pac-Man Championship Edition consists entirely of navigating Pac-Man through a maze, eating dots, power pellets and bonus items (such as fruits, keys, and other objects), and avoiding the four ghosts that roam the maze as well. If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, the player loses a life. Eating a power pellet causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them and send them back to their home, where they re-emerge in their original form.
However, there are several major differences from its original counterpart, making Pac-Man C.E. a faster paced game. Each maze is divided into two halves. Eating all the dots on one half causes a bonus item to appear on the other side, and eating the item causes a new maze to appear on the other half. Players can also collect additional power pellets to increase their powered up time and continue earning maximum points for eating ghosts.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Mania</name>
		<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<desc>The goal of Palamedes is to clear the screen which is, line by line, filling up with dice. Players control a small person situated near the bottom of the screen, who can only be moved to the left or right. The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.

There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</desc>

		<name>Panic Restaurant</name>
		<desc>Panic Restaurant is a side-scrolling platform game where you play as chef Cookie. The rival chef Ohdove has taken over his restaurant and it's up to Cookie to reclaim it.

It is a fairly basic platform game. You run and jump, and enemies are placed all around to try and stop you. The entire game, backgrounds, enemies and bosses, is food-themed. You encounter things such as sausages, microwave ovens, onions and hamburgers on your way through the restaurant. To your help you always have a frying pan to beat the enemies with, and you can also find other items, such as a spoon, and plates to throw at the enemies.

The game contains 6 stages, each in a separate location in the restaurant, such as the kitchen, freezer and basement. At the end of each level you are faced with a boss. In between each level is a bonus game where you play a slot machine to try and win some extra health and lives.</desc>

		<name>Perfect Pair</name>
		<desc>Perfect Pair is a homebrew NES game and the third and final game in the developer's Holiday series. Most likely the occasion for this title is Valentine's Day. The idea was that a physical version of this game could be gifted to a retro gamer as the end of the game could be personalized.

In this game the player controls Cupid bringing eternal happiness to a couple by collecting all hearts in each level. Each level takes place on a fixed, single screen and has a chain-like lay-out with loops that have hearts inside. To collect a heart Cupid needs to circle the heart on the chain to change the chain's colour. Once the loop is completed the heart inside is acquired. A loop does not need to be completed in one go. The colour changes when Cupid has passed and this can be continued at a later movement. Cupid is controlled direct and no other buttons are used as there are no other actions.

While the string-like design does not leave much room for evasion it is still needed to avoid the lurking enemies. The player needs to keep track of their paths so as not to become trapped. The game keeps track of the score and there is a limited amount of time complete a level. Levels gradually become more complex. Later levels introduce big hearts. When one of those is acquired, Cupid briefly becomes invincible and can run through enemies, stunning them for a short while.</desc>

		<name>Pesterminator : The Western Exterminator</name>
		<desc>When Ronnie the Super Rat radiates earth with a pest beam from his moon base, the world leaders' only hope is Kernel Kleanup, the mascot from the Western Exterminator Company. With his trusty hammer, Kernel needs to clear the levels by slamming all loose bugs. You will be haunted by spiders, ants, fireflies, worms, sharks, jellyfish and mutants.

The nine levels are pretty straightforward side-scrolling platform stages, with a nice twist in level 5, 7 and 8.1 (a helicopter, underwater and moon surface level respectively). While playing, you can view a status report with the remaining bugs to be found. Some defeated enemies leave behind hearts (extra lives) and the final level introduces an adventure element when you have to find a key card to open the door to Ronnie's lair.</desc>

		<name>Pictionary : The Game of Video Quick Draw</name>
		<desc>Based on the board game, the object is to guess either a word or phrase based on a drawing. Each team starts on the same square on the board and the first team attempts to draw a picture based on a clue.  If his team correctly guesses the clue, then this team gets to roll the dice and advance along the board.  If the team fails to guess correctly, then the other team gets a chance to draw and guess. The game plays much in this way until a team reaches the final square on the board and successfully guesses the clue to win the game.

This game contains three different modes; regular game, alternative game, and drawing practice. It also allows for up to four teams which can be made comprising of any number of players per each team. 

In the regular game, a team will be given a turn to start revealing pieces of one of the 500+ drawings that are hidden in the game. Each drawing is a 6x8 size and has 48 pieces to it. To reveal the pieces, the player is made to play one of four timed minigames which are chosen depending on the color of the square the player landed on the board. The minigames consist of Attack of the Paint Zombies, The WareHouse Shuffle, Leapin' Energy Capsules!, and Four Alarm Rescue. In Attack of the Paint Zombies the player fires downwards at the aliens and the more aliens that are hit the more pieces that are revealed of the drawing. If the aliens hit the player, the player loses time off the clock. In The WareHouse Shuffle, the player goes all the way to the left side and then stacks as many boxes on top of each other that they can bring over all the way to the right side. While transporting the boxes, their are two enemies who can hit into your boxes thus subtracting them from the haul and also taking time away. Each box brought over reduces a piece of the hidden drawing. In  Leapin' Energy Capsules!, the player is an astronaut and is moving and jumping to collect blue spheres. While collecting the spheres the player must try to avoid hitting any enemies which will reduce time. Each sphere collected clears up another piece of the drawing. In Four Alarm Rescue, the player controls a pair of firemen on the ground with a net who are moving back and forth catching the jumping people above on the net. Each person rescued leads a revealed piece of the drawing while each person not rescued leads to reduced time.

The alternative game allows the player to draw the picture for other players to guess, so their are no minigames in this mode. Other than that, it is the same as the regular mode.

Drawing practice lets the player practice their drawing technique without the pressure of a timer.</desc>

The game is played with a split screen; the bottom half of the screen remains on your flippers, while the top half scrolls to follow the ball(s) on the table. In addition to recreating the pinball game's table, lights, and sounds several video game elements have been added, such as monsters that like to eat pinballs. Up to four players can compete against Pin-Bot!</desc>

		<desc>Billed as a pinball role-playing game, though the term is used loosely, as you only earn gold to buy stoppers and more powerful flippers.  Actually, there are four different modes of play.  The RPG-mode has six, multi-screen pinball tables, where you use your flippers to knock the pinball into enemies, find keys, and eventually rescue Princess Bali.  The other modes, POP!POP!, Viva Golf, and Circus, are each specialized multi-screen pinball tables involving sports, golf, and the circus.  The latter has a slot machine and a bonus game in which you throw balls at animals to save the girl they are chasing.</desc>

		<name>Pipe Dream</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

		<name>Pirates!</name>
		<desc>Modern warfare is no match for the fierce realism of six historically accurate severteenth century pirate raids along the Spanish Main. Aye, matey! That's why plundering and pillaging are back in style, as you command the role of a high seas high-jacker. Either an English Buccaneer, Dutch Adventurer, Spanish Renegade or French Explorer, each with a different skill level and strategic impact.
As a swashbuckling scoundrel, you'll barter with enemy merchants, trade for hidden treasure maps, negotiate with unscrupulous governors and forge alliances with monarchs who'd just as soon stab you in the back than float you a loan for new ships. Buth that's only half the battle! You'll also assault towns, sword fight with garrison commanders, lay siege to forts, and fire your cannons broadside at an armada of naval foes, including Spanish War Galleons, Dutch Frigates, French Merchantment and English Sloops.</desc>

		<name>Platoon</name>
		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</desc>

		<desc>Popeye is a conversion of the arcade action/platform game. As Popeye, you are trying to win Olive Oyl's love! She is at the top of the screen dropping tokens of her love, and you need to collect them before they hit the ground. After you have collected the required number of items, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. There are many obstacles trying to stop you from completing your task, though! Brutus wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect a can of spinach, you can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!</desc>

		<name>Power Blade</name>
		<desc>It is the year 2191, and Earth's blissful existence was governed by a master computer. Then suddenly, its master control program malfunctioned, and people panicked ensuring total chaos. Secret Agent Nova is called in to locate agents located in six sectors. These agents hold an ID card which Nova must acquire to gain access to the security room within each sector. There, he must defeat the guards and obtain secret tape units, and if Nova obtains six of these, he will be able to gain entry to the control center and defeat the guard to destroy the computer and restore order to society.

Power Blade is a platform game, in which you must run through the level, destroying various enemies, and exit through the door. However, you can't leave each sector without locating agents.  By destroy enemies, you can get power-ups which restore your energy or upgrade your weapon. Occasionally, you can get a special power-up which transforms you into a Mech, which has a special attack mode and an three units of energy.

You must get through each sector before time runs out. You can leave a sector without getting the ID card and go to another sector, and come back when you're ready.

Power Blade is the significantly altered US Version of Power Blazer</desc>

		<name>Power Blade 2</name>
		<desc>Christmas Eve, 2200.

The Delta Foundation has just finished the development of a cyborg unit which represents a new generation of fighting robots. They want to sell it to the government's department of defense as it would pose a threat to the security of the nation if it is sold to a foreign country. They have asked the president, who is actually an alien from outer space, to consider their offer and respond in one week. The government takes this matter very seriously, and assigns Nova to destroy the Delta Foundation. Unfortunately, the government cannot be involved in the event that something might happen to him.

Power Blade 2 has six stages which involves you running through the level, while killing off enemies and avoiding hazards. At the start, you can choose which stage to start at, but unlike Power Blade, once you have chosen a stage, you can't exit and choose another one until you have completed the current one first. Nearly each stage involves you using your wits, as you dodge spikes, jumping towards the top of the screen to avoid fire, and getting fans to lift you onto platforms. You can also slide your way through tight spots, as long as you slide in the right place.

At the end of each stage, you fight a different boss. However, in the end, you must fight all the bosses you fought before before you get to fight the alien leader.</desc>

		<desc>Mark Tyler, the world's most famous boxer, boasts that he is absolutely invincible and that he can defeat any contender in the world. Nay, the universe! Well as luck would have it a race of alien fighters heard of Mark's claims and have decided to abduct him and pit him against the fiercest boxers in the galaxy.

Power Punch 2 is a one-on-one boxing game à la Punch Out, in which you control Mark as he battles all of the alien contenders in hopes of getting the galactic boxing belt. The game is played from a 3rd person perspective from which you see both fighters as they fight. You have rudimentary movement controls but the basic mechanics involve dodging and timing your attacks so that you can break the enemies patterns. Between fights you get to train in a gym, which involve taking part in a series of mini-games with the rewards being upgraded strength, speed or health for you upcoming bout.</desc>

In Jungle Mode, the object of the game is to survive the dangers of the jungle while you shoot down guerillas and wildlife using a variety of weapons including machine guns, laser rays, and grenades (all with unlimited ammo). You exit the stage by entering a cave to proceed to the next level. Sometimes there is more than one cave, and you will be warped to another stage other than the next one, depending on what cave you enter.</desc>

		<name>Prince of Persia</name>
		<desc>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

		<name>Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</name>
		<desc>Many growing seasons ago, the Salad Kingdom was a peaceful land. But one day, minister Pumpkin betrayed king Broccoli, kidnapped princess Tomato, stole the royal Turnip Emblem, and took them to his castle in Zucchini mountains. He sent his cruel Farmies to terrorize the Salad Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, the king died, unable to recover from the loss of his beautiful daughter. But he promised you, the brave Sir Cucumber, the princess' hand and the entire kingdom, if you save the beautiful Tomato from the clutches of the evil Pumpkin. 

Princess Tomato is an adventure game in which you interact with the environment by choosing commands from a menu, such as the traditional "check" or "give", and the less traditional "praise" or "percy". Percy is a little persimmon who will be your trusty side-kick throughout your quest and who will help you on many occasions. The puzzles are on the simple side, and are primarily based on talking to characters, finding items and giving them.</desc>

The training mode in the NES version allows you to practice both offense and defense. The training mode in the SNES version lets you either practice in an exhibition game or compete in a shootout. The super cup is based on the round-robin format in the NES version. The teams chosen to compete in the super cup are decided by the teams rankings from the season mode in the SNES version.

The game is played with a top down view of the hockey rink, with the screen scrolling vertically as the puck carrier heads towards a net.</desc>

		<name>Probotector 2 - Return Of The Evil Forces</name>
		<desc>After losing a confrontation against Super Commandos Mad Dog and Scorpion, the juices of destruction drip from the spiked tongue of the vile alien warmonger - Red Falcon. Now, he's coming back stronger than ever, with a sinister plan that includes having his intergalactic warriors seep into the brains of the U.S. Army. To support his disguised forces of doom, he's recruited Jagger Froid, a demented alien from the Black Hole Galaxy. He's also shuttled in The Babula Destructoid Mechanism with its Beam of Death. With torrential terror about to rain down upon civilization, Earth's only hope rests with you, Scorpion, and your pal, the Dogster. And if your spread guns, lasers, flame throwers and mega shells fail to destroy Red Falcon's eight levels of terror, including radioactive lava fields, it's all over but for the shouting, the screaming and the cries from a disintegrating world!</desc>

		<name>Punch-Out!!</name>
		<desc>"Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream" is the reedition of the previous version "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!". Contrary to popular belief, Tyson was not removed because of his rape conviction (which did not occur until a year after the changeover), but because his contract expired. Since he had lost the title to James "Buster" Douglas by that point, Nintendo made no attempt to negotiate a new contract with him. Tyson was however, slated to appear in a sequel of his own (Power Punch II) where he would be the protagonist, but as a result of his imprisonment, Nintendo lost interest and instead used a generic boxer named Mark Tyler.
Due to Mr. Dream being a simple head-swap and recolor of Mike Tyson, Mr. Dream fights in exactly the same manner as Mike Tyson in "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!" but has a better fighting record. For the first 90 seconds of the first round, Mr. Dream can floor Mac with one uppercut. The player can block these punches to reduce the impact, but it isn't recommended, as they l end up with little health left after that. While Mr. Dream can't use "flooring punches" forever, his punches are quick, his reaction time is top-notch, and he's also a difficult opponent to fight. The pass code to fight him is 007 373 5963.</desc>

		<name>The Punisher</name>
		<desc>The NES version of The Punisher is an on-rails shooter tracking behind Frank Castle as he trades fire with the gangs of some of his classic enemies. Aside from being one of the few NES rail shooters, the game features an uncommon amount of destructible items in its levels. You also have the ability to move Frank to the left or right of the screen to dodge incoming fire, or to hold down the fire button to lock him in place and move the aiming cursor.

The game features six "missions" with a number of varying environments and levels within them. Standard pickups of armor and increased firepower are present, as well as grenades which can be launched with the B button. Earning a 100% kill rating (as The Punisher would surely try to do) gives an unlimited "Super Gun" upgrade for the next stage.</desc>

		<desc>The object of Puzzle is to reassemble a picture which has been scrambled. The picture is broken into a number of pieces with one or more open spaces. Slide the pieces into the open spaces to rearrange them back into the proper order. If you're stuck, you have the option of challenging the computer to a game of chance like rock, paper, scissors or roll the dice. This will subtract 60 seconds from your time, but if won allows any two pieces on the board to be swapped. If you forget what the picture looks like, you can pause the game and see the completed version, but this can only be done five times per puzzle. There are eight different levels, plus two additional expert levels.</desc>

		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

In order to break the tiles you must first land on the tile, then jump off causing it to crumble. The tricky part of this game is that you need to first break all the tiles and then return to the start tile before advancing.</desc>

		<desc>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you guide a marker which must draw rectangles and other weird objects in order to claim your territory, and you can either draw these rectangles fast or slow. Drawing the rectangles using the "slow" method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced "kicks"), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing. Once you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to the next level.</desc>

Now he has to set out to collect them all. They are scattered throughout the outback, with plenty of treacherous terrain and a variety of wildlife to get past before all the boomerangs can be found.

- Super Robin Hood:
Marion is being held captive in a castle by the Sheriff of Nottingham. It is up to Robin Hood to rescue her! The castle is heavily guarded, and there are many secret passages to find and locked doors to get past.

- Treasure Island Dizzy:
Dizzy has set out on his new boat, the HMS Eggwhite, for a short vacation. After a storm throws him off course, he ends up stranded on a strange island. Dizzy must now explore the island and find a way to repair his ship in order to get back home.

		<name>Quattro Arcade</name>
		<desc>Quattro Arcade is an collection of 4 action arcade games, all of which feature single and 2-player modes.

1. C.J.'s Elephant Antics: C.J. the elephant went and got himself caught in an elephant trap. One thing led to another and the next thing you know, he's in a Parisian zoo. He makes a break for it and vows to make his way back home to Africa, traveling through Paris, Switzerland, and Egypt in order to reach his destination. This game is a side-scrolling action game. Offensively, C.J. can toss bombs at myriad enemies in his path. He also has a parachute that allows him to glide safely down from great heights. 2 players can play this game cooperatively as 2 differently colored C.J. characters.

2. Stunt Buggies: this game involves 1 or 2 players piloting buggies around dangerous mazes filled with renegade buggies on a quest to collect all the bombs in order to escape the maze.

3. F-16 Renegade: your crazy professor has hacked into the US Air Force's computers and programmed all of the jets to fly off and start World War III. Since no one will believe your tale on this matter, you take it upon yourself to follow your professor's footsteps: you hack into the USAF computers yourself but to locate the F-16 training program so that you can then break into the air base and heist a jet in order to take down all of the malevolent computer-controlled jets. The action in this game consists of flying a jet and shooting other jets. However, the perspective alternates from overhead scrolling (odd levels) to 3rd person view from behind the jet (even levels). Powerups come in the form of stronger weapons, smart bombs, and extra lives. The game also features a 2-player competitive mode.

4. Go! Dizzy Go!: Dizzy's nemesis, the evil wizard Zaks, has abducted Dizzy's friends. Thus, the task falls to Dizzy to rescue them. To do this, he must collect fruit in a variety of dangerous mazes scattered throughout several worlds including an underwater realm, forest realm, a pyramid, a mountain, and a castle. Additionally, 2 players can team up to conquer the mazes.

All of the games feature 2-player modes. This is an unlicensed NES game.</desc>

		<desc>Here's the baseball action that started it all - the one, the only, the original RBI. With permission from the Major League Players Association, this game uses the names and likenesses of real baseball players. This means the ten different teams in the Tengen league can have lineups that include baseball stars of the time; such as Reggie Jackson, Fernando Valenzuela, and Willie McGee. Stats and abilities have been structured to give each player strengths and weaknesses he had in the 1986 and 1987 seasons. You'll have to use your knowledge of real players and teams to manage your lineup effectively.

The teams you can choose from include Detroit, California, Houston, San Francisco, and even the American and National League All-Star teams. In One-Player mode you compete with the computer for the pennant in a nine game season. If you want to go head-to-head with a friend, you can each pick your favorite team and then compete in your own best-of-seven series.</desc>

		<desc>R.B.I. Baseball 2 features all 26 major league teams, each with a full roster of players. You can choose any National or American League team. You can even play one of the 1989 All-Star squads.

The game features One Player and Two Player options as well as a Password mode to enable you to play a full season (one game against every team in the division). In addition, a watch mode provides you with the best seat in the house for a computer-controlled match up.

This second version is similar to the original game in terms of gameplay. This time around the game uses the teams and statistics from the 1989 season. Just as in the original, you get to see what it's like to step up to the plate as Ricky Henderson, pitch the ball like Nolan Ryan, and catch a line drive like Ozzie Smith.</desc>

		<name>R.B.I. Baseball 3</name>
		<desc>R.B.I. Baseball 3 took the popular baseball series a step further statistically, adding each Major League Baseball division winning team from 1983-1990, in addition to the 1989 All Star teams and all 26 1990 teams (with full 1989 statistics). Want to see how the 1986 Mets might have done against the 1987 Twins? Here's your chance.

The game was licensed by the Major League Baseball Players' Association; thus, real Major League players and statistics are included, but the teams themselves are represented only by their home cities. Team names are not used. Also, retired players who were no longer under contract with the MLBPA in 1991 are not present. Rather, they are represented by their initials and their fielding positions.

Game mechanics remain unchanged from R.B.I. Baseball 2, focusing more on arcade fun than realistic gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>This second Pro-Am racing game for NES introduces some innovations compared to its predecessor. Once again, you have to bring your red radio-controlled car to victory, score points, hit turbo speed lines, and leave no chance to your blue, green, and yellow adversaries. But you can also upgrade your engine and tires - if you can afford it, which means you'll have to think seriously about gathering those dollar signs scattered on the track. The tracks themselves have more variety, some have unusual enemies (little planes bombing you from above), and more kinds of obstacles. You also have several lives and don't die immediately if you arrived last.</desc>

		<desc>Rad Racer II is an arcade style racing game which is the sequel to Rad Racer and features similar gameplay. Played with a 3D perspective from behind your vehicle, the goal is to race through a series of different tracks before time runs out. Along each track are several checkpoints; crossing a checkpoint will increase the amount of time you have to reach the final destination. Eight new tracks are featured (with new graphics and music), each with a variety of hills, turns, obstacles, and other cars to get in your way. Crashing into other cars or any obstacles on the side of the road cause you to slow down or come to a stop and lose valuable time. Also new is a turbo boost which allows you to reach speeds of 255 mph. Unlike the original game, you now only have a choice of one car and the red-blue 3D glasses aren't supported.</desc>

		<name>Raid on Bungeling Bay</name>
		<desc>Raid on Bungeling Bay is the first game designed by Will Wright. 

The game has the player controlling a helicopter which is on a mission to destroy everything that moves. The only ally is the carrier, which is where the player begins at each level and may return to for repair and pick up bombs, as long as the player manages to protect it from being destroyed. The main goal in each level is to destroy a factory, which requires a steady increasing amount of bombs. Enemy forces include ships, planes, tanks, anti-air guns, and eventually, a large battleship.</desc>

		<desc>Sequel to Bubble Bobble, Rainbow Islands sees Bub and Bob (in 2 player mode), who are now curiously small boys rather than dinosaurs, attempting to rid the Rainbow Islands of bad guys.

Using the power to cast rainbows, trapping anything underneath, the boys must ascend vertically 4 levels each island, with a big, bad boss at the end of each.

By trapping beasts under your rainbows, then jumping on them to break them you can collect seven different colored gems, and there are also power-ups for extra speed and rainbows.</desc>

		<name>Rally Bike</name>
		<desc>There's a cross-country motorcycle rally going from San Fransisco to New York. In Rally Bike, the player has but one goal, to work their way up through the ranks of the racers and place high enough to qualify for the next race. The game contains six stages to race through.

The player controls a motorcycle and must cross the finish line before an established number of competitor bikes. The player must avoid crashing into obstacles, opposing racers, vehicles, and running out of gas. During a race there are certain areas where the player can refill their gas but stopping to refuel will cause competitor bikes to take advantage and race past the player. Competitors never run out of fuel but they are able to crash into obstacles thus taking them out of the race.

Occasionally during a race a helicopter will fly by dropping items that the player is able to pick up. The items are a 1000 Points Bonus, helper motorcycles that help you crash other racers, extra gasoline, Hi-grade gasoline which lasts longer than normal, a   turbocharger that gives extra speed, and a helmet which provides  invincibility.

If the player places in the top ten in a race, they are able to tune up their bike with better equipment. The player can upgrade their bike's engine (either 2 cycle type or 4 cycle type) and its tires(either rain, brock, or stick).</desc>

		<desc>John Rambo is a Special Forces solder that is currently spending time in military prison, well until Colonel Trautman decides that Rambo is the ideal solder to be sent on a special mission. Rambo’s mission is simple, go to Vietnam and photograph the POW camp there. He is also ordered not to engage the enemy or rescue any POW’s.  In Vietnam, Rambo meets his contact, Co, and she sets up the passage to the POW camp. During the mission Rambo cannot bear just photographing the POW camp when he has an ample opportunity to rescue a POW in the camp. So Rambo, disobeying his orders, tries to rescue a POW, which is when it all starts to go wrong.

Rambo is a side scrolling platform game where the player controls Rambo with his mission to Vietnam. The game starts at the military base before getting sent to Vietnam. In Vietnam, Rambo has to fight animals in the jungles, swamps, and caves like wasps, snakes, fish, tigers, bats, spiders, birds, apes and flamingos. Before making his way to the POW camp he has to fight guards and mercenaries that can kick and shoot him, all wearing different color shirts depending on how powerful they are. The game also requires the player to navigate a complex map requiring the player to find North and South points on the ground to go up and down levels as well as East and West by moving Rambo to the edge of the screen.  There are 6 different weapons that Rambo can pick up that are knife, throwing knife, bow and arrow, bow and exploring arrow, gun, and hand grenade. All the weapons but the knife has limited ammo which is collected from killed enemies. There is also health vile that restores health as well as mission specific items that Rambo must find to complete some missions. The game uses password save that can be retrieved when talking to any person.</desc>

		<desc>George, Lizzy and Ralph were just ordinary Americans, until an experiment went wrong, turning them into a Gorilla, Lizard and Werewolf respectively. Following this, the three of them plan to go round destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in.

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human.</desc>

		<desc>A medieval masterpiece of power, strategy, and ingenuity!

The objective is brutally simple: engage your enemy in an all-out exchange of cannonfire, then assess the damage and rebuild your castle.

But the reality of RAMPART is far more complex. The key to victory lies in how quickly you can pick up the pieces and redesign, refortify, and extend your walls before the next battle begins.

Whether you're facing an onslaught from the computer's armada, or pitting your castle cannons against another player's, there's only one way out. Defend... or perish.</desc>

		<name>MTV's Remote Control</name>
		<desc>Remote Control is based on the MTV quiz show of the same name. During the game three contestants (computer or human controlled) compete by answering questions about various TV shows, movies, characters, or actors/actresses. There are two rounds of gameplay followed by a third "think real fast" round. 

In the first two rounds of gameplay the gameboard consists of a giant TV with nine channels; one of the players chooses a channel (representing a particular category) revealing a question; the first player to buzz in and provide the correct answer earns points. The are a variety of categories available (some of these are "video high", "cop shows", "saturday night live", "soap operas", and many more) which will vary from game to game. Sometimes a surprise channel may appear which doesn't have a question, but awards or removes points from a player. These rounds end when all of the supplied questions have been exhausted. Near the end of the second round, the lowest scoring player is eliminated from the game leaving two players for the final round.

The final "think real fast" round lasts for thirty seconds; during this time the players need to answer as many short answer questions as possible to earn points. At the end of this round the player with the most points wins the game.</desc>

		<name>The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show : Buckaroo$!</name>
		<desc>Stimpy invents the Gametron 5000 Moneymaker which is the first video game machine in the world that rewards the player with money. Ren, who is always on the lookout to get rich, eagerly gets to playing with the video game system on the quest to earn big bucks. 

In the game, you control Ren &amp; Stimpy through various side scrolling levels which are based on different episodes of the cartoon show.  Episodes the levels are based on are Space Madness,Out West, and Robin Hoek. 

In Space Madness, Space Cadet Stimpy must get a dazed Ren to the sick bay to feed him some chicken soup to cure him of his space madness. You will guide Ren through the Space Diner, the Laboratory, the Button Room and the Zero Gravity Bathroom to get to the sick bay. There are also parts of this level in which you will control the spacecraft that involves side scrolling shoot em up gameplay.

Out West pits Three-Fingered Hoek and Stimpy the Kid, in the role of horse thieves. You must guide the buckeroos through the outskirts of town, past the corrals, through the rusty frontier town and to the stables, where you'll find the sheriff's horse to steal.

During Robin Hoek, Ren is the finest archer in all of Logwood Forest. Armed with trusty bow and turkey baster, you must make your way through the village and rescue the fair Maid Moron from the clutches of the evil sheriff, who is holding the maiden captive in his castle.</desc>

		<desc>This is the conversion of Taito's scrolling beat 'em up, which later produced unofficial sequels Target: Renegade and Renegade III: The Final Chapter.  The game is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.</desc>

		<desc>The evil Slick has kidnapped Ryan's girlfriend and taken over the high school. The player is cast as either Ryan or Alex (second player) and has to fight his way through River City's merciless gangs before confronting Slick and freeing his girl. 

River City Ransom is a side-scrolling beat-em-up similar to Double Dragon. The player, or players, travel through the locations of River City, encountering various gangs along the way. Gang members can be defeated with punches and kicks, or beaten up with objects scattered around. Upon their defeat, gang members drop money which Alex and Ryan can spend in malls to buy items that restore health and improve their combat abilities. The main characters have RPG-like numerical stats that can be improved this way, and can also buy books to learn combat manoeuvres. To finish the game, the player(s) have to find and defeat all the bosses.</desc>

		<name>Road Runner</name>
		<desc>This game is based on an arcade game that was released by Atari.

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.</desc>

		<name>RoadBlasters</name>
		<desc>RoadBlasters is a futuristic racing action game. The goal is to reach the finish line in one piece throughout each of 50 levels. Numerous enemies are out on the road to try and stop you, including armored cars, motorcycles, canons on the side of the road, landmines, and more. 

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.</desc>

		<name>Robert Byrne's Pool Challenge</name>
		<desc>Robert Byrne's Pool Challenge (from here on out referred to as "Cue Stick') was being developed by Odyssey Software during 1992. George C. Rucker III programmed the Cue Stick game and it would later be passed on to American Video Entertainment for publishing. Due to a twist of fate with the gravity of the pool balls in Cue Stick, the game was pushed back and passed on to American Video too late.

American Video Entertainment had licensed the game with famous pool shark Robert Byrne. Byrne requested some last minute changes before the game shipped, American Video Entertainment folded, and Cue Stick was canned. Odyssey Software survived for a few more years before they met a similar fate.

The game is filled with tons of features. There are four different modes of play including Straight Pool and Nine Ball, a trainer mode, and several table colors to choose from. There are also several different frictions (or lack of) that you can add to the table, including ice and sand. This option gives the balls a slightly different behavior, increasing the challenge.

Cue Stick is viewed similarly to Side Pocket. If you press select during gameplay you can see the numbers on the different balls. A chart at the bottom allows you to decide the force of the Cue Stick against the Cue Ball.

At first appearance one might comment that it is just another pool game. However, the options make the game superb.</desc>

		<name>Robo Warrior</name>
		<desc>In a desperate measure to combat the overpopulation of Earth, scientists work to create an artificial planet named Altile, named after the scientist who designed it. During the construction of Altile, humanity has become united and peaceful. During this new era of prosperity, Earth decommissions the RoboWarriors, a force of heavily armed half-man half-robot war vehicles. But from another dimension, aliens calling themselves the Xantho Empire and lead by the being Xur invade planet Altile and terraform it for their own uses. The survivors of Altile send out a distress call to Earth. Receiving this message, the people of Earth quickly activate the latest and most powerful of the RoboWarriors, a model known as ZED (Z-Type Earth Defense) and send it at top speed to Altile.

Controlling ZED from an overhead view, the player is able to move in any of 4 directions (up,down,left,right), drop bombs and shoot a projectile weapon. The terrain of Altile is made up of many obstacles and the bombs serve to destroy these and make passage for ZED. Destroying any enemy or obstacle may yield different power-ups which contain any of 10 different effects (including ammunition and energy refills) which may be stocked and used at any time from the menu. Or the power-ups may be instant-use refills for bombs and energy supplies.

Additionally some levels contain keys, which unlock doors and Chalices which prevent the level from running on endlessly. Secret areas such as a Well of Hope and a Room of Idols may also be found. Altogether, there are eight different "worlds" for ZED to conquer, containing numerous stages and guarded by a vicious boss monster.</desc>

		<desc>Patrolman Alex Murphy was killed on the streets of Detroit. The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</desc>

		<desc>RoboCop 2 is a mission-based platform game. Missions have various objectives, such as destroying nukes or killing all the enemies. If you didn't destroy/kill enough, you'll be transported to a training mission, which is a first-person perspective shoot 'em up. Should you also fail the training, you must go to the beginning of the previous mission. Successfully completed mission or enough points scored by training allow you to proceed to the next stage. Unlike in the first RoboCop, there's no time limit, and you are able to jump.</desc>

The levels usually consist of several platforms, and are heavily populated by enemies who shoot at you. You can gather special repair kits, which will be used to restore your health after you've completed a level. "RoboCop 3" is more of a shooter than its predecessors, having more and tougher enemies.</desc>

You are a brave warrior who has accepted the challenge of rectifying this situation. Using only a boomerang for offense, the hero descends into the depths of the underworld. The game begins with a flying/shooting side scrolling level and then proceeds to walking/jumping side scrolling action. All kinds of undead creatures (mostly skeletons) are waiting to destroy you.

Audibly, the game makes liberal use of digitized voices, a rarity for 8-bit NES games.</desc>

		<desc>Rock 'N' Ball is a pinball game with several gameplay options. The first is regular pinball game for one to four players. The second option is called nineball and the object is to shoot the balls into the playfield and have them land in the holes to form a bingo pattern (i.e. a vertical line, a horizontal line, etc.) This game is also for one to four players. Next is battle flipper. There is a set of flippers at both the top and bottom of the table, and two players try to knock the pinball past their opponents flippers. Lastly is sports pinball. In this game the pinball table is set up to look like a soccer or hockey field. Similar to battle flipper, each player tries to knock the pinball past their opponents goalie. There is only one flipper in this game, however you have a goalie to block shots and the flipper can be moved from side to side.</desc>

		<desc>In the 1940s, the Nazis built a base on the moon and plan to use a mysterious substance called Lunarium to reduce people's intelligence. However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</desc>

		<name>The Rocketeer</name>
		<desc>The Rocketeer is based on the 1991 Disney movie of the same name. Nazis are trying to steal an experimental jet pack that will presumably give them a strategic edge in modern warfare for the purpose of world domination. It is up to the hero to don the jet pack and the helmet to stop the Nazis and keep the world safe.

The Rocketeer is a side-scrolling, run-and-jump (and sometimes fly) game. About halfway through the first stage, the Rocketeer is able to scavenge jet fuel power-ups, in addition to health and ammo power-ups. The fuel power-ups allow him to use his namesake power and fly for short distances. The Rocketeer has 6 offensive options available from the start of the game, limited only by the amount of ammunition points he has in reserve: A punch (requires no ammo points and is therefore unlimited), pistol (1 ammo point per fire), tommygun (2 ammo points), spread gun (3 ammo points), grenade (5 ammo points), and a bazooka (20 ammo points).</desc>

		<desc>Willy is a young jazz cat who goes by the name of "The Rockin' Kat". His girlfriend, Jill, was kidnapped by Mugsy, the local crime boss.

In this side scrolling game, you must help Rockin' Kat Willy to save his girlfriend through 7 stages. Each stage is a TV show broadcast through different channels of a TV set, and you must thus choose which channel you want to play. Through the channels Willy it will be sent to different themed shows such as western movies, gangster movies, etc, as well as some bonus channels.

Willy can walk and jump around, and carries as a weapon a spring-load Super Punch Gun, which he can put in diverse uses:

1. Knock his enemies: by pressing A.
Perform higher jumps: by jumping (B) and pressing down + A.
Spin Attack: by grabbing a ledge (A) and rotating with the d-pad.
Spin Jump: by grabbing a ledge (A), rotating with the d-pad and jumping (B).
Catch and Trow: by holding A, grabbing an object and releasing A.

He can also buy attachments that will make his gun more powerful, such as the Bomber, the Twin Balls, the Hammer Punch and the Jet Sneakers.

		<name>Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball</name>
		<desc>Join one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history for Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball. While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox. 

The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.

A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.</desc>

		<desc>Rollerball is a pinball simulation for one to four players. 

There are two different game variations included. The first is Skyscraper, which is a four screen tall pinball table where each player competes individually for the highest score. The second is called Matchplay. In this game two players compete against each other to see who can reduce his opponents score to zero first. Each player has a set of flippers and a ball in play, and points are awarded or taken away by hitting the various targets in the playfield.</desc>

		<desc>In Rollerblade Racer your goal is to enter (and hopefully win!) the super rollerblade challenge. In order to enter the race, you will first need to qualify by earning 5,000 points and completing several obstacle courses. As you rollerblade through the suburbs, city streets, beaches, and parks you can earn points by performing a variety of tricks and jumps. Additional points are earned by completing the course under the time limit. There are also several bonus rounds where you need to navigate through (or jump over) obstacles such as barrels or cones. In order to place in the super rollerblade challenge, you need to complete all of the events and the challenge with 10,000 points for third place, 15,000 for second, or 20,000 for first! If you crash too many times during an event or run out of time, the game will be over. The game allows you to select one of two characters, and features an isometric overhead point of view which scrolls to follow the action.</desc>

		<desc>This is a platform game in the same fashion as Turtles II, that is that it's a sidescroller were you can move up and down on the screen, but you go on rollerskates. This makes the game go much faster than its counterpart, which adds difficulty and also a sense of speed.

It includes a silly story about three different roller skates gangs (somewhat like motor cycle gangs) in a close future, which is most an excuse for the game to exist.

You can choose between three different gangs, one is all-around, one is fast and weak (and consists of women) and one is slow and strong, you get the fashion. This adds some replayability, but in reality, they are kind of the same.

The game also suffers from trial and error; you must learn the courses if you want to master them. Luckily, the game has unlimited continues.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The game concept is still the same, though they did improve a lot of features that one may consider 'disturbing' from RTK I (e.g. Generals dying easily due to disease, etc.). RTK can be said to be much more 'stable' where players no longer have to worry that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to build up their forces without much interference. The RTK II gameplay and interface is closely similar to Nobunaga's Ambition II.</desc>

		<name>RumbleStation 15 in 1</name>
		<desc>The Rumble Station is a NES-on-a-chip based Famiclone system that contained 15 games. It includes every NES game developed by Color Dreams, as well as two Sachen games published by them. Color Dreams licensed out the games for use on the system. It was originally distributed by Systema in the United Kingdom, and by Pelican in the US under the name Game Station Arcade. (although the menu screen still said "Rumble Station")

At its heart the Rumble Station consists of a generic NES-on-a-chip micro-controller (a complete cloned NES on a single chip) with 15 games programmed into it. The system is the size and shape of a Dreamcast Game controller (without the window for a VMU), and is powered by either 4 AA-size Batteries or an optional 9V DC Power Supply (Sold Separately). The casing itself is blue, with a black panel where the window on the Dreamcast Controller once was.

The syste features jacks for Composite Video Output and Audio Output (2x RCA Connector - there is only Right-side Audio output).

		<name>Rush'n Attack</name>
		<desc>Depending on which title you use, and how you interpret it, this game is about a guy who a)rushes in before attacking b)attacks Russians (this was the mid-80s, when the US helped bin Laden do the same), or c)wears a rather goofy hat. One way or another, this arcade conversion arms you with a knife and sends you on a kamikaze mission against hordes of enemy fighters.

There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters</desc>

		<desc>Yeah this is a weird one, Russian Roulette NES Style.. Will you be the next Christopher Walken? Let's hope not eh! The rule of the game is simple: pull the trigger… and pray. One revolver, six chambers, one bullet. See who comes out alive. Try a higher difficulty for a more risky challenge. Square off against another player or play against the CPU. Battery back-up saves the high scores. Graphics based on characters from the film The Deer Hunter (1978 Michael Cimino) Sound and Music (based on Russian folk songs). Don't try this at home Kids!</desc>

		<desc>Alien Invaders approach the solar system from their interstellar battle platform, named Fortress Balangool. Under the command of the Master Control, named L-Brain, the Invaders defeat Earth's space forces. Only one hero, Captain Commando remains to defeat the alien armada by entering Balangool and fighting through the various sections until reaching Section-Z.

Section-Z is a side-scrolling shooter where the player must travel through the maze that is Balangool. Typically this consists of traveling through a scrolling corridor and reaching the end where a new direction must be chosen. Captain Commando's abilities are shooting directly left or directly right while moving around the screen. Power-ups can be collected by defeated enemies and include; improved lasers, a 3-way cannon and shield, these can be stored until needed. There are also SMS (Special Transmission Shell) power-ups, which require energy to use Energy units,are used to absorb enemy fire. Loss of all energy or running into an enemy or a wall causes death.

Certain sections of Balangool are blocked until a generator can be found and destroyed. There are four different boss creatures that must be defeated when encountered.</desc>

		<desc>Two different tribes existed on planet Colura, the Petras and the Basrah. The Basrah were aggressors and eventually drove the Petra underground. However many Petra survivors were trapped on the surface of the planet. To that end, a rescue bike named the Gilgitt Petras was created. It must venture up to the surface and save as many Petras as possible.

Seicross is a side-scroller. Controlling the Gilgitt Petras, the player must race across the screen, collecting Petra survivors and fuel power-ups. The single weapon and ability available is the ability to fire straight ahead.</desc>

		<name>Sesame Street : Big Bird's Hide &amp; Speak</name>
		<desc>Sesame Street: Big Bird's Hide and Speak is a game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was one of the simplest-to-play NES games ever released commercially. This game stars Big Bird and co-stars Little Bird, and features Bert, Ernie, The Count, Grover, and Elmo. This game was developed by RSP Inc. and published by Hi Tech Expressions. All 4 sides of the D-pad move little bird to the next window clockwise; A and B Buttons both choose a window. The center buttons (Start and Select) exit to the game select screen. The game's objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.</desc>

The only way to lose in the game is to touch the incorrect numbers (numbers other than the one you are required to find) which will drain your life bar. There are also two bonus levels that involve using counting and addition/subtraction skills.</desc>

		<desc>You control Sgt. Helmet ? your mission is collecting 5 bombs, setting them in the DULL computer, and then return to the base. Use keycards to open closed gates and kill every clone soldier if he stands in your way. You can destroy the barbed wire to progress (but avoid touching them!) as well. But beware! Bullets are prized and you better save them. You can refill your ammo with the magazines you will find across the map ? but you better be savvy. Use boulders to block lasers so your ass doesn't get burned and? GOOD LUCK!</desc>

		<name>Shadow of the Ninja</name>
		<desc>In the 21st century, the evil Emperor Garuda has taken over the city of New York, killing many of its inhabitants. You play as either Hayate or Kaede, two ninjas who are attempting to free the city from Garuda's control.

Shadow of the Ninja is a typical side-scrolling action game, consisting of running, slashing and jumping through 5 levels, each with 4 sub-stages with numerous and varied foes, and a boss enemy at their end.

Kaede and Hayate can not only jump; as ninjas, they can hang from platforms and make swift saltomortals between floors. Sometimes, canisters containing powerups can be found. Typical powerups extend range of the default sword, or they may be additional weapons such as throwing stars and a ninja weapon that looks like a big grappling hook on a string.

The game allowed two players to play cooperatively, a rare feature for action games outside of the Contra series.</desc>

		<name>Shadowgate</name>
		<desc>Using the same graphical interface as Deja Vu, Shadowgate is an adventure game set in a fantasy world. Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps.

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at you suddenly, unexpectedly, and most of all OFTEN. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause you to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. It's allso worth mentioning the fact that if your torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and you forget to light a new one, you'll trip in the dark and break your neck.

A Windows 3.x update to this game was created in 1991.</desc>

		<name>Shatterhand</name>
		<desc>Shatterhand is an action game with eight-direction scrolling. You control Shatterhand in his quest to find and defeat General Grover, leader of the Metal Command. Through the game you’ll encounter all kinds of mechanical and biomechanical creatures. Shatterhand’s primary weapon is his cybernetic fists and therefore most enemies must be defeated by punching them.

Additional help can be given from any of the eight hovering satellite robots, each of which has it’s own weapon that fires automatically when Shatterhand throws a punch. These satellite robots can be obtained by collecting combinations of alpha-beta letters that appear when you punch some of the white boxes that are scattered throughout each stage.

The game has seven stages. The first and the last must be played first and last respectively, but the five middle stages can be played in any order. The path to the final showdown with General Grover leads through a factory, a refinery, an anti-gravity research facility, a submarine, a burning subway, a filtration plant and finally to General Grover’s missile launch complex.</desc>

Each level is broken down into smaller scenes and hostages are guarded by big blokes who throw swords. Watch out for gun-toting enemy henchmen and ninjas.

Reaching the end of each level will find you battling it out with a boss. These range from 8ft giants to helicopter gunships.</desc>

		<name>Shockwave</name>
		<desc>In Shockwave you need to retrieve powerful crystals left behind by the Tarian race. The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.</desc>

		<name>Shooting Range</name>
		<desc>The aim is to shoot the discs on the screen so that you can acquire enough points to pass the clearing point score of that particular stage without your time or energy running out. You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250 and the 3rd difficulty level only 200.
Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which        extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points.
The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.</desc>

		<desc>The main objective is to cross different USA cities and reach the predetermined scores to go ahead. But remember: you'll have only 16 balls and every error can be lethal!

The game also comes with modes for 2 players with two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional mode) and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to sink 9 balls before the other player makes them first. If you prefer, test your target in Trick Game or even hear your favorite song in Jukebox.

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!</desc>

To be victorious you will need to battle both military forces and alien creatures in a variety of different landscapes. Along the way different weapons can be found to help your assault, along with temporary invincibility and energy replenishing power ups after destroying certain enemies. There are eight different worlds with numerous, deadly enemies to conquer.</desc>

		<desc>You are now a member of the Silent Service, the US Navy Submarine command. For a long while after Pearl Harbor, you are the only forces capable of striking back at the Japanese in the Pacific. Take one of the "fleet boats" and go on extended patrols of up to 2 months from Hawaii, Australia, or New Zealand. Set your difficulty/realism level and time period (early means less tech for juicier targets, later means tougher escorts, more tech, lousier targets). Contend with factors like dud torpedoes, maximum depth, and more. 

You can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war. 

How well will you do when matched against history?</desc>

		<desc>Silkworm is a classic horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up based on the 1988 Tecmo arcade game. The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you got to be on land as well as in the air.

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).</desc>

		<name>Silver Surfer</name>
		<desc>The Silver Surfer roams throughout space as herald to Galactus, looking for new planets for him to feed on. However his mission is interrupted by a summon from Galactus. Silver Surfer learns that creatures from the Magick Dimension are trying to break through into the universe and their coming will end all life. Vowing to stop them, Silver Surfer must assemble the pieces of a mysterious Cosmic Device and use it to push them back. The pieces of the Device are currently in the hands of some malicious creatures: Reptyl, Mephisto, Skrull Emperor, Possessor and Firelord. Silver Surfer must travel to their domains and defeat them in order to obtain pieces of the device.

Silver Surfer is a shooter game, with some levels taking place vertically and some horizontally. The Surfer's only ability is to move around on the screen and to shoot directly in front of him. Power-ups that can be picked up include: the letter "F" (Firepower) which will increase the number and power of his projectiles, Smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen, the letter "S" (Speedup) which increases the surfer's movement and Orbs which will also fire the Surfer's weapon. Orbs are special in that two can be obtained (only 1 is shown on horizontal scrolling levels) and they can be positioned to fire forwards, backwards or sideways.</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons : Bart vs. the Space Mutants</name>
		<desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.</desc>

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.

Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons : Bart vs. the World </name>
		<desc>This game is actually a compilation of smaller games belonging to different genres. Krusty the clown appears in the beginning of the game and presents a menu with five games to play (one of which is not available from the start): A jump-and-run game, where Bart must find an exit on a ship, while enemies fire at him and try to prevent him from reaching the exit; a card game, where you have five tries to find hidden cards on a board; a simple jigsaw puzzle; a series of trivia questions concerning the Simpsons; and finally, a platform-skateboard game (available only after you have completed the ship level). Needless to say all games are connected to the famous TV series "The Simpsons".</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons : Bartman Meets Radioactive Man</name>
		<desc>Bart Simpson is reading the latest comic about the Radioactive Man but his favourite superhero is not featured in it. When he is at the last page, his sidekick Fallout Boy appears. He tells Bart he is the only one who can save Radioactive Man who has been sent to the Limbo Zone, a mysterious prison that revolves around a black hole. Bart turns into Bartman and he has to fight three super villains to collect Radioactive Man's lost powers before facing the mastermind Brain-O the Magnificent.

Players control Bartman through 2D side-scrolling platform levels. He needs to defeat enemies, collect goodies, and be careful not to fall into one of the deadly traps on his way. Bartman can punch and kick, and collect lightning icons to shoot small bolts. Most of the level sequences require precise timing and pixel-perfect jumping precision. Bartman has five life points that are restored by collecting radioactive signs.</desc>

		<name>Skate or Die</name>
		<desc>Skate or Die incorporates five distinct styles of skating, which can be attempted individually or in turn. You skate around a menu room to choose which one to attempt. Before taking off you can visit Rodney's skate shop to buy equipment.

The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is to score as many points as possible in 10 attempts. Judges determine how much style and skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same equipment, only this time your task is to jump as high as possible at the end of the ramp.

The downhill events are overhead-view races. In the Downhill Race you simply try to complete the course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you try to outperform a human or computer opponent whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You can use attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock your opponent over. 

The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up using a stick, set within a pit to skate around.</desc>

		<desc>In this sequel to Skate or Die, you have the option of just skateboarding on a ramp, or to go through an adventure. In the adventure, you are in a small community called Elmood. You play as the hero in this game. Basically you are trying to keep skateboarding and your life as it was after the Mayor of the town bans skateboards. After dealing with this, you set out to build your own halfpipe, and you deal with whatever comes your way. In this game, you go through many obstacles, and other skateboarders shooting paint and throwing eggs at you, you also can shoot at them, and of course upgrade your board from Lester when you run into him on his skateboard, as well as Lester who will give you tricks (giving them whatever they want, whether that's fries, drinks, CD's, etc;).</desc>

		<desc>You are the legendary Red Baron, flying a plane through a horizontal side-scrolling scenery set during World War I. To complete a mission, you simply need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes. For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.

You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.</desc>

		<desc>In Slalom you need to ski down different trails and beat the clock to move on to the next of the 24 trails. Other skiers, trees, snowmen, sledders, and moguls will get in your way and slow you down if you crash into them. Slalom flags are located throughout the trails, and skiing on the wrong side of these will cause your player to snowplow momentarily and lose speed, so to get the best times you need to make sure none of the flags are missed.</desc>

		<name>Smash T.V.</name>
		<desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

		<name>Snake's Revenge</name>
		<desc>An unofficial sequel to the original Metal Gear for the NES. Three years has passed since the Outer Heaven incident. FOX-HOUND has gained intelligence that an unknown terrorist group has seized a remote facility containing mass-produced Metal Gear tanks, as well as a new Metal Gear prototype which was under development. The newly-promoted Lt. Solid Snake is called back into action to infiltrate the terrorists' base with the help of two FOX-HOUND rookies, former marine Nick Myer and navy intelligence agent John Turner.

The player once again assume the role of Snake. The objective is similar to the previous game, as the player must avoid any kind of visual contact (even moreso than the first game), while collecting weapons and equipment on-site. There is a greater variety of areas such as a jungle, a warehouse, a train, a couple of prisons and even a cargo ship containing the mass-produced Metal Gears. The player must also overcome new traps such as searchlights, soldiers in gyrocopters, door-sealing devices and even suicide bombers. The player must also interrogate captured enemy officers by injecting them with a truth serum to increase their rank, in addition to saving hostages like in the first game. Side-scrolling areas are also included in addition to the main overhead game, where the game takes a more action-oriented route (while still maintaining the stealth premise).</desc>

		<name>Snoopy's Silly Sports Spectacular!</name>
		<desc>The Silly Sports are being held in it's traditional home of Italy and Snoopy, from the Peanuts comic strips, will want to attend. Snoopy packs his plane and brings along his relative, Spike as an opponent and the little yellow bird, Woodstock to judge. 

Now Snoopy's ready to compete with 1 or 2 players in his own custom olympiad of the following "events":
The Sack Race: Snoopy and Spike race against one another in  competing potato sacks.
Boot Throwing: Just like the Hammer toss, but involving an old boot.
Pogo: Hop on a Pogo Stick and hop over obstacles.
Overboard: Snoopy and Spike play "King of the Boat" trying to knock each other into the water.
Pile of Pizza: Balance the pizzas while trying to walk towards the finish line.
River Jump: Pole Vault over the river (actually sticking the pole into the river) to the other side.

The Japanese version of this game uses a Donald Duck license rather than a Snoopy license (changing many of the character names above), but gameplay remains the same.</desc>

		<name>Snow Brothers</name>
		<desc>Nick and Tom are two Princes living the dream with two beautiful princesses. When suddenly the evil King Scorch freezes Prince Nick and Tom and kidnaps the Princesses. Now Nick and Tom find themselves with abilities dealing with snow and ice. These two Snow Brothers will need to hunt down the evil King Scorch and rescue the princesses.

Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use  snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into  giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually  defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.</desc>

		<name>Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship</name>
		<desc>The golden warpship was once the most powerful ship in the galactic fleet. But the ship was captured by aliens, and its parts scattered throughout twelve different worlds. On each world deadly aliens, booby traps, black holes, and extreme gravitational forces guard the parts. It is now up to Solar Jetman to land on each of the worlds and retrieve all the parts so the golden warpship may be reassembled.

At the beginning of each world, Solar Jetman starts out at the mother ship and explores using a jetpod. When a part of the golden warpship or something else of use is located, the jetpod can be used to haul it back to the mother ship. The mother ship will move on to the next world when all the parts on the current world have been brought back. If the jetpod takes too much damage, Solar Jetman must return to the mother ship for repairs before continuing the quest.</desc>

		<name>Solomon's Key</name>
		<desc>Solomon's Key is a platform game with both action and strategy elements. On each level your goal is to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit. To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.</desc>

		<name>Fire 'n Ice</name>
		<desc>The peaceful island Coolmint is attacked by flame monsters sent by the evil wizard Druidle. The queen of the winter fairies chooses the novice wizard Dana to drive back the monsters.

Fire 'n Ice is a puzzle game seen from a side-view perspective. The goal in each level is to extinguish all flames by pushing or dropping blocks onto them. The player takes control of Dana who can create or destroy ice blocks, climb blocks and push loose blocks. Ice is created diagonally below Dana in the direction that he is facing, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed. However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a flame, so that the player will often have to find a way to create ice blocks next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning it can't be moved and won't fall down. It is therefor also possible to create ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used to extinguish flames, but they are indestructible and only move one space when pushed (unless they are on an icy surface).</desc>

		<name>Spider-Man : Return of the Sinister Six</name>
		<desc>From the ingame intro:

"Doctor Octopus is plotting the crowning caper of his criminal career... to rule the world.
He has reunited the Sinister Six and with these super-villains together again, nothing stands in their way - except Spider-Man!"

Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six is a side-scrolling game which puts you in the role of Spidey throughout six levels against Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin and Doctor Octopus respectively. Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles.

Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.</desc>

It features plenty of "tongue in check" humor as you take on the role of Vin Katana, who must defeat the intergalactic corporation Ultra before they turn every video game in the universe into a pachinko machine. It appears the villains of the game are a parody of Konami. In gameplay terms the game is fairly straight forward, you make your way through six stages avoiding obstacles, shooting enemies and each stage ends with a boss fight.</desc>

		<desc>Spiritual Warfare is a Zelda-like clone where you play as a soldier of God, fighting the forces of darkness in various parts of a modern city to find the armor of God, each one guarded by increasingly difficult demon bosses. When you are dire need, an angel may come down and help you, if you answer Bible questions correctly.  The game will take through increasingly difficult levels of play, where in the end you will face off with Satan himself.</desc>

		<name>Splatterhouse - Wanpaku Graffiti</name>
		<desc>Wanpaku Graffiti is the first Splatterhouse game to appear on a home console. It is not clear how it fits in the series' timeline, but it starts with Jennifer mourning over Rick's grave (her boyfriend). Lightning strikes his grave and he is resurrected. Before she can rejoice, another bolt strikes the grave next to him and a jack-o-lantern appears. This pumpkin king kidnaps Jennifer and Rick barely has the time to wipe off the dust from his clothes before he sets off to rescue his girlfriend.

Although the game is not as gory as the other titles, there is still plenty of disturbing enemies such as headless chickens, severed hands and zombies. Through seven side-scrolling levels, including a graveyard, a mansion, a Japanese pagoda and an Egyptian pyramid, you chase the pumpkin king with your cleaver and a shotgun you can pick up along the road. Just like the other games in the series, there are lots of movie references. The game often needs good timing and pixel perfect jumps, as falling down from platforms will regenerate the enemies. You can pick up candy, hamburgers and cans of soda to restore your health.</desc>

		<name>Spot : The Video Game</name>
		<desc>A puzzle game loosely featuring licensing from the 7Up soft drink. The gameplay involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away.

When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is full.</desc>

		<desc>A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>

		<desc>M.A.D. magazine’s comic strip of the same name comes to life in this game which was designed for one or two players. The innovative split-screen shows both spies at the same time. Play with a friend or against the machine.

The black crow and the white crow are out to beat each other before the time bell rings. Find the needed objects by digging through drawers, closets and furniture in the house. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance).

Fights ensue when both spies enter the same room.  Find hidden weapons in the rooms to help with those fights, since one of you will die if you run into each other.</desc>

		<name>Sqoon</name>
		<desc>When the rulers of planet Neptune find that they are running out of their main food source – man-ham – they hit on a devious plan: Invade the nearby planet earth and melt the polar ice-caps, thus sinking all cities. Then imprison the human creatures in underwater factories where they can be turned into a fresh source of man-ham.

The plan goes perfectly. The leaders of earth's nations are taken completely by surprise as the ice-caps melt and the globe is flooded. It seems that humanity will meet its end on the dinner plates of the Neptunian monsters. But wait! One hope remains, in the form of evil pirate Narikeen, who has been the scourge of the world's nations, pillaging and causing general distress in his pink submarine, Sqoon. The leader of the world's ailing defense force turns to this former public enemy number 1, and with some difficulty manages to convince Narikeen to save the world.

In this side-scrolling shooter, you control Narikeen's sub, Sqoon. Sqoon is equipped with two weapons; an upgradable missile launcher which shoots straight ahead to take out the weird Neptunian enemies and an ice-bomb which shoots horizontally downwards to blow up factories and other installations. Destroying these buildings releases the humans inside, who then float out so you can rescue them. When you have nine people on-board, a small mobile island will appear on the surface, allowing you to drop off the humans and re-fuel. You'll need to save a lot of people and re-fuel regularly, as your sub only lasts about 60 seconds on one tank of gas. There are eight levels in the game, each set in a different (sunken) country.</desc>

		<desc>The game opens on a vegetative theme: siblings Maru and Cori are sent to bed early for not eating their vegetables, whereupon they drift off to sleep and dream together. Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! "Lettuce check it out," urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. "I yam King Kale," he says, "Won't you peas peas help me?" Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.

It seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and "vegetable-themed" guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.

Our two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.</desc>

		<desc>Set up R.O.B. with the colored discs included in the game and then control his movements in the game by using Professor Hector to jump onto various blocks. The blocks represent commands given to R.O.B. in sequence.

This game can be played in several different ways.  In the regular game, you have to stack up the colored discs as fast as possible and in a certain pattern and sequence. In memory mode you program an entire sequence of movements to move the discs and won't know if it actually works until you RUN the program. Finally there is a 1 or 2 player bingo mode in which you align different columns and rows to BINGO and activate rob commands. An opponent will also hop around activating commands. Your goal is to have R.O.B. move as many of the colored discs without dropping them.</desc>

		<name>Stanley : The Search for Dr. Livingston</name>
		<desc>The game is set in Congo, Africa, in 1870, and its main character is a historical figure. You play as Henry M. Stanley (1841-1904), a reporter for the New York City Newspaper, who was sent by his employers to chronicle the work of the famous Africa-explorer, Dr. Livingston. Unfortunately, the Doctor left without you, hating press and everything connected to it. Recently he disappeared somewhere in the jungle of Congo, leaving only a few notes. Apparently, he was on the trail of
re-discovering the legendary lost temple of the Amut people, Am-Zutuk. You decide to follow his steps, to find the lost Dr. Livingston, and maybe to learn more about the mysterious people of Amut and the temple.

The game takes you to Congo, where you can move from location to location on a "world map" with about a hundred accessible areas. You should make your way through platform levels populated with wild animals and other foes. Some of the levels are impassable or serve no purpose, others contain valuable clues and useful items. You can also visit town areas and talk to people. There is a variety of weapons to be found during your quest, including "native" ones such as blowpipe and spear.</desc>

		<name>Star Trek : 25th Anniversary</name>
		<desc>The Ship Enterprise is on a 5 year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. While the Enterprise is investigating strange gravitational disturbances, it is drawn into a dimensional hole and ends up in unknown space with broken warp engines. Now, Captain Kirk and his crew must try to repair the ship and find a way home.

Gameplay is divided into two parts, taking place on the ship's bridge and away missions. On the bridge, you can communicate with other ships, call up a map to navigate the ship (once the warp engines are fixed), enter battle mode to fight other ships (which does not happen very often), save the game or beam down to a planet's surface.
These away missions make up the major part of the game and play very much like other action adventures. You can talk to aliens find and use objects, solve puzzles and fight against hostile lifeforms.  Battles with other ships or on away missions are handled in simple Shoot'em Up-fashion.</desc>

		<desc>Cadets at Starfleet Academy must spend some of their classes in the starship simulator. This year is a simulation of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Substituting for Jean-Luc Picard, cadets will take the role of captain and then must access different crew members (functions of the ship) to complete a series of scripted missions.

Star Trek: The Next Generation is divided into a series of missions. Players will start on the main screen of the bridge and from there can access Navigation, Tactical, Operations, Engineering, Transporter Systems and Mission Control. Mini-games are sometimes used to complete certain ship functions (such as rerouting power to the shields).</desc>

		<name>Star Trek V : The Final Frontier</name>
		<desc>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier was a 2D platform game which was developed by Bandai for the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System). It was based on Star Trek V: The Final Frontier but was canceled before its intended release. The incomplete game was inconsistent with many plot and character elements of the finished film.

In 2006, a four-stage prototype version was leaked online as a ROM image file that can be played either through PC emulation or on an actual NES.

The first two stages and final stage were in the form of a side-to-side shooter. The third stage entailed space combat in which the player took the USS Enterprise-A through an asteroid field and then into battle against a Klingon cruiser near the "creation planet".</desc>

		<name>Star Voyager</name>
		<desc>CosmoStation Noah, located in Spiral Galaxy IX, is under siege by Molok Wardrivers. Now it's time for the pilot of the RH119 to fend off the Molok Wardrivers and save the CosmoStation.

Star Voyager's gameplay requires the player to venture through various sectors of the galaxy in search of different alien fleets so they can be defeated. Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade the player's equipment to fight off the enemy fleets. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship's warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If players do not warp to different sectors wisely, they might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.</desc>

Your ship is equipped with both a standard laser and an independently fired ground weapon, which you must coordinate to defeat ground and aerial enemies. A shield bar keeps track of your damage and you can replenish it by defeating certain enemies, but otherwise its just you, your ship and several stages of alien enemies that alternate between top-down and side-scrolling perspectives.</desc>

		<name>Stealth ATF</name>
		<desc>Stealth ATF is a flight simulator in which you pilot a F-117A, a.k.a. Nighthawk in several missions.

In every mission's beginning and ending you have to take off and land your plane respectively, from a side view. If you fail to land after completing the target objectives, you fail to succeed in mission and thus have to replay it.

Your view during the flight is from inside the cockpit, and the gameplay offers total freedom of movement on flight. Your terrain is infinite, and your enemies will re-appear in your radar every time they fly out of range. You fly in different locations, such as the Middle East, Alaska, the Pacific, etc. During flight, you can also turn off the music and play with only the flight sounds.

Your mission is to defeat a fixed number of enemies each mission. Your targets will always be aerial ones. You can shoot a cannon (which ammunition is unlimited) or missiles (8 per mission). If an enemy shoots you a missile, you can try to avoid it using the stealth mode (pressing the start button) once per mission. The stealth mode will automatically turn off once you pass out of the danger. If you manage to accomplish the mission perfectly, a bonus round is offered, and you have to try to take down as many enemies as you can.

The game can be played by one or two player taking turns. A second player can also take control of the aircraft closest to the center of the radar, either in one or two player mode.</desc>

		<desc>Save Professor Cinnamon!  When aliens from the planet Attackon kidnap the inventor during their invasion of Earth, two TwinBee Stinger jets (armed with boxing gloves) are unleashed to rescue Cinnamon before the aliens turn the Earth into a giant ball of cotton candy!  

In this vertical and horizontal scrolling shooter, blast away unusual creatures and even more bizarre bosses, while collecting power-ups and super weapons. By repeatedly shooting bells that come out of the clouds, these bells will change colors, each color giving a different ability. Getting shot down releases a ghost of Stinger, which can be recollected to gain the jet's powers back.

In the two-player mode, if TwinBee (cyan craft) and GwinBee (green craft) align their flights (one behind the other) they can turn their guns into a ripple laser. The Japanese version features a three players mode, with the addition of WinBee (the magenta craft, which was removed from the US version).</desc>

		<name>Street Fighter 2010 : The Final Fight</name>
		<desc>The player is Ken, the hero of the Street Fighter series. It's been 25 years since he last participated in a fighting tournament. He has become a scientist and has developed a powerful medicine together with his friend Troy. But an unknown fiend breaks into his laboratory, kills Troy, and steals the invention. It's time to recall the good old days and to embark on a quest for revenge!

Despite the US title, the game has little to do with the Street Fighter or the Final Fight games. This is an action platformer in which the player navigates Ken around, trying to avoid or kill the enemies by shooting at them with ranged weapons, adjusting the direction of the shot, or kicking and punching them. Ken is very agile and can jump high and climb walls.</desc>

		<name>Strider</name>
		<desc>The Striders are a global organization of infiltration specialists who work to combat villainy and keep the world safe. From their orbital space station, the Blue Dragon, they are able to quickly reach anywhere in the world.

Hiryu is one of the top striders. He is given the task by Vice-Director Matic, of finding another captured strider, Kain. But rather than mount a rescue, Hiryu is told his assignment is to kill Kain. Hiryu questions these orders and travels to Kain's last known location to try to find him...

Strider is a platform game where Hiryu must fight his way past enemies and uncover keys, characters and data disks (which can be analysed aboard the Blue Dragon) to find out what's going on. His primary weapon is his jumping ability and sword, the Cypher, which he uses to strike with great speed. At some point in the game, the Cypher may be modified to shoot plasma arrows. Hiryu also has a various set of "skills" which he learns as he gains levels. Examples of skills are a healing ability (Medical), a jumping ability (Jump), some additional attacks (Spark, Fire, Sp-Ball) and the ability to leave an area (Warp).</desc>

		<name>Stunt Kids</name>
		<desc>Stunt Kids is an unlicensed head-to-head dirt bike racing game featuring a pair of helmeted, yet clearly wide-eyed children. Two human players can compete head to head, or a computer can control the second player, as the kids race dirt bikes through increasingly difficult obstacle courses whilst collecting power-ups. The dirt bikes can jump and lean and the player needs to take advantage of the bike's abilities in order to avoid being thrown clear.</desc>

		<name>Sunday Funday : The Ride</name>
		<desc>This unlicensed title contains three different games, not released separately: Sunday Funday, Fishfall and 4HIM: The Ride.

Sunday Funday is an adaptation of the game Menace Beach, and contains a changed storyline and some graphical changes. The storyline now deals with a boy trying to make his way to Sunday school. Gameplay consists of riding a skateboard through various obstacles and defeating enemies who try to hinder the player's progress.

Fishfall is a game where the player controls a hand trying to catch as many freefalling fish as possible and then throwing them upwards toward a moving basket in order to meet a quota.

4HIM: The Ride isn't a game per se, but a sing-a-long of a song by Christian pop band 4Him.</desc>

		<desc>This ain't elementary school and it sure as heck ain't gym class. This is Super Dodge Ball. Control your team of six players to pummel the opposing team into submission using only the ball and your team's unique skills. Each player has his own special attacks and each team has their own unique attributes.

Play the World Cup mode and take on teams from around the world to claim the championship. You play as the star USA team and must work your way through teams from countries such as England, Iceland, Japan, and more to finally take on the current ruling world champions, the Soviet Union.

Or you can challenge a friend in Versus mode and go head to head with whatever teams you choose.

Or, if you just feel like cutting loose, you can play Bean Ball mode which is just a free-for-all every-man-for-himself romp in the school yard. Be the last man standing. You can play this alone or with a friend, but the computer will control the remaining 4-5 players.</desc>

Your shuttle commander has been trapped in a dimensional maze in space, and you must use your glove to throw an energy ball at the walls in order to advance.

The walls in each maze room you encounter are filled with blocks. Using your Power Glove, you have to entirely break down a wall before being allowed to advance to the next room. 

While trying to progress through the maze, your character will be under attack by a range of creature, and a wizard who wants to mess with your work. The object for the player is to find the way out of the maze and rescue the Commander.</desc>

		<name>Super Jeopardy!</name>
		<desc>Super Jeopardy! is based on the popular Jeopardy! TV game show. In this digital incarnation, 4 players compete at answering reverse trivia questions in trademark Jeopardy! fashion-- i.e., the host provides the answer and a player has to provide the questions. As many of 4 human players can participate, with the remaining slots filled by the computer. Competition takes place in quarter-final, semi-final, and final round modes.

A player will select a question from one of 6 categories. The game gives the answer to the question and the players use their controllers to buzz in. At that point, a player has 80 seconds to spell out the question (and the computer has already provided the "What is..." question preamble). In the player gets the question wrong, that player loses money and the remaining players have an opportunity to buzz in.</desc>

		<desc>The Princess has been kidnapped by the evil Bowser, and it is up to Mario and brother Luigi to save the day.

The first ever platform adventure for the Mario Brothers has the player exploring level after level, with Bowser to contend with as the end of level boss. Power-ups include the Super Mushroom, which increases Mario's size and power, the fire flower, allowing him to shoot fireballs at enemies, and the ever important starman for a short burst of invincibility.

Each level includes a bonus section filled with coins plus a shortcut through the level, plenty of bad buys and obstacles to get past, and an end of level flag, in which the higher the player grabs it, the more points are awarded to them. Certain levels also include warp points, which takes the player to higher levels.</desc>

		<desc>One night Mario has a strange dream, where he opens a door to another world filled with even stranger creatures and lands then those in his last adventure against Bowser. Amazingly, the next day, Mario, Luigi, Toad, and the Princess stumble upon a cave, which leads to the world that was in Mario's dream.

Subcon, the land of dreams, is under an evil spell thanks to Wart, so Mario and the gang must save the day. New creatures to defeat and plenty of nasty surprises await.

Choose from the four characters, each differing in speed and jumping ability, and head on through 7 levels each filled with puzzles, bosses, bonus money, the always helpful mushroom, and invincible star, plus bombs and magic potions. 
After each level, depending on the coins you collect, you can use them in the bonus game to collect extra lives.</desc>

		<name>Atlantis No Nazo</name>
		<desc>In "Atlantis no Nazo", you play a nameless archaeologist who must descend into the dangerous caverns of the lost continent Atlantis, and eventually find his way to the inner sanctum with the legendary treasure. The game plays like a standard action-based platformer. The levels feature plenty of enemies and gaps you must jump over. Your only weapon are sticks of dynamite. When you throw a stick, it will bounce off the floor and explode only after a couple of seconds, so very precise aiming and timing are needed to defeat the enemies. Many levels contain optional treasure chests as well as hidden doors that lead to bonus levels. Sometimes level progression is non-linear, i.e. you can jump straight to a high-numbered zone if you find the correspondent door on the level. All the levels are timed. The protagonist dies when he falls into a pit, touches an enemy, or runs out of time.</desc>

		<desc>Super Spike V'Ball / Nintendo World Cup was a pack-in game included with the Nintendo Entertainment System Sports Set. The package included a standard NES console, four game controllers, and the Four Score Multiplayer Adapter. The cart included two games developed by Technos: # Super Spike V'Ball, a two-on-two beach volleyball game where you played on a tournament, ending with the world championship. The game supported up to four players on one match at a time; # Nintendo World Cup, a soccer game where you (and a friend) chose to represent a team and played several matches until you won the World Cup. The game featured little to no rules, which means that you could hit your opponents as much as you want, without fear of the referee getting in the way. Both games were compatible with the included Four Score NES multiplayer adapter.</desc>

The racetracks start simple and gradually get more complicated, and may also feature obstacles ranging from traffic cones to tornadoes. Occasionally wrenches will appear in the roadway, and when collected they can be used after a race to power up your car with better tires, better acceleration or a higher top speed.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2525, things are a mess. politically. Terrorists led by someone named "X" want to attack the United Nations. The CIA is in charge of discouraging the attacks. To that end, and since all of their best agents have failed the task, they send out an unofficial agent -- you, the Super Spy Hunter.

The Super Spy Hunter has a super spy car. It's actually a well-armed car that can turn into a boat or a plane at opportune times. The action is fast vertical scrolling as the vehicle faces all manner of powerful vehicle threats from a well-funded terrorist enemy -- cars, trucks, helicopters, etc. Luckily, there are many powerups to collect along the way, both defensive and offensive.</desc>

		<desc>Super Team Games is a side scrolling game where two players compete in races on an obstacle course. The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</desc>

Luckly, his good ol' friend Meemaid, the evil sorceress-turned-super heroine learned about the incident as she was using the ATM in the very moment the bank was being robbed.

That's why they decide to head back over to the new and refurnished Storm Palace to regain the lost fortune. But it won't be easy? the new basement is deep and full of dark corners. Besides, the intrincate disposition of rooms makes it easy to get lost and walk in circles. And that's what happened: Uwol and Meemaid got lost and reached in the deepest side of the labyrinth ? where Vampy, Franky, Fanty and Wolfy, plus the death murderer and the children's favourite Cthulhy dwell. So you may guess it won't be an easy task to escape with the money!</desc>

Some ground structures that must be destroyed are hidden and are called Sol Citadels. To locate these hidden structures you must keep an eye on the target-sight that will flash when it goes over the structures.

Super Xevious takes all the great elements of the original Xevious and has also some improvements.
Some examples of improvements are, for instance, the shield option and the upgrade option.
The shield protects you from immediately death if you got hit during an attack.
The upgrade option gives you the possibility to upgrade your bombs, lasers and shields.</desc>

		<desc>Sword Master establishes the tale of an evil wizard in league with a monstrous demon who have dared to kidnap a damsel. The Sword Master is a knight who seeks to rescue the fair lady and destroy the evil people and creatures in the castle in which they dwell.

It is a parallax side-scrolling action game in which the player must use sword and shield to battle through 7 game levels, from the forest, to a cursed town, to multiple levels of the villain's castle lair. The player will encounter giant bats, wolves, skeleton warriors, evil knights, wizards, lizard men, gargoyles, and other fierce enemies on his quest. The Sword Master can swing his sword, defend with his shield, and gather power-ups which enable him to change his form; for example, the Sword Master can transform into a magic user himself and cast offensive magic spells.</desc>

		<name>Swords and Serpents</name>
		<desc>Deep in the dungeons lay the fabled ruby treasures.  Many brave souls have tried to recover them; all have failed.  Little did they know how futile their quests would be -- they met a horrible fate at the hands of a horrible serpent king.  Can your party of champions defeat the dragon and claim the ruby treasures? Or will you, too, be vanquished?

Swords and Serpents is a first-person, party-based CRPG in the tradition of Wizardry. Put together a team of 4 heroes (roll your own characters or simply use the pre-generated party) from three classes: warrior, thief, and magician.  A 16-level dungeon awaits you, full of weapons, armor, magic spells, and other valuable items.  Beware, though: an assortment of traditional fantasy beasts and villains awaits you!  

Teleporters and "zoom tubes" speed up your travels.  Temples provide safe havens for your party to restore health and mana. An auto-map feature helps the player keep track of what locations you have visited.  A password system allows you to save your progress as you travel deeper into the darkness.</desc>

The dragon is only vulnerable from the rear so you need to sneak up on your opponent to tag him. Be careful, though, that your opponent does not sneak up on you and do the same to you. In a one player game, it is you versus three computer controlled dragons. In a vs. mode game, it is you versus another player controlled dragon. In a double player game, it is you versus another player and three computer controlled dragons in a wild free-for-all.</desc>

		<name>Disney's TaleSpin</name>
		<desc>Based on the Disney cartoon Talespin. Baloo's airline cargo company, Higher for Hire, makes deliveries all around the world. The air pirates, lead by the daring Don Karnage have increased their attacks against air travel. In order to foil the plans of the pirates, Baloo trades in his normal plane for a "Mini Sea Duck", designed to fly more maneuverably.To get his cargo delivered on time, Baloo must fly over many dangerous areas, and also pick up any cargo stolen  or scattered by the air pirates. Eventually, the fortress of the air pirates themselves must be destroyed for air travel to remain safe and profitable.

Talespin is a side-scrolling shooter, moving left to right across the screen. The Mini-Seaduck can fire projectiles and switch direction, flying right-to-left while upside-down. The money you make from recovery of these cargo items can be used to purchase upgrades at the end of each level from Wildcat, the mechanic.

		<name>Disney's TaleSpin</name>
		<desc>Based on the Disney cartoon Talespin. Baloo's airline cargo company, Higher for Hire, makes deliveries all around the world. The air pirates, lead by the daring Don Karnage have increased their attacks against air travel. In order to foil the plans of the pirates, Baloo trades in his normal plane for a "Mini Sea Duck", designed to fly more maneuverably.To get his cargo delivered on time, Baloo must fly over many dangerous areas, and also pick up any cargo stolen  or scattered by the air pirates. Eventually, the fortress of the air pirates themselves must be destroyed for air travel to remain safe and profitable.

Talespin is a side-scrolling shooter, moving left to right across the screen. The Mini-Seaduck can fire projectiles and switch direction, flying right-to-left while upside-down. The money you make from recovery of these cargo items can be used to purchase upgrades at the end of each level from Wildcat, the mechanic. Many strange boss creatures and devices will guard the final areas of most levels.</desc>

		<name>Jajamaru Ninpou Chou</name>
		<desc>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate.

Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.</desc>

		<desc>Tecmo Baseball is one of the many baseball games released for the Nintendo Entertainment Systems. There are five modes in Tecmo Baseball: One Player, Two Player, One Player Allstar, Two Player Allstar, and a watch mode. In One Player mode you pick from one of the fourteen teams and challenge each of the other teams. A password feature allows you to continue from where you left off. You also have the option of using the DH rule.

Gameplay is similar to the many other baseball released for the NES. The camera angle when batting or pitching is from behind the pitcher. The pitcher can pitch the ball high and low, as well as curve it. Tecmo Baseball includes digitized voices for the umpire.</desc>

		<name>Tecmo Bowl</name>
		<desc>The most popular American football game to hit the NES console, Tecmo Bowl pits the player vs. the computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff action, or you can go head-to-head with a human opponent in action or coach mode.  There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don't look for official NFL team logos or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has the NFLPA but not the NFL license.

The play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally.  Player graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team.  Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.

There are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen.  Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap.  A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.

There are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.</desc>

		<desc>This basketball game is very similar to Tecmo Super NBA Basketball with the main difference being their rosters. The game has 27 NBA teams with a roster of 324 Players. Each player has a rating for his shooting ability, stamina, jumping power, running speed, stealing ability, and blocking ability. The game allows for pre-season and season modes. In the season modes the game tracks team &amp; player statistics throughout the season.

You can choose between four modes of play: Manual, which enables you to control an individual team; Coach, which turns the play calling (but not the actual playing) over to you; Computer, which gives all the controls to the computer; and Skip, where the results of a computer-played game are posted, without the game ever having taken place. The game also allows you to set the quarter's time from two minutes to 12 minutes.</desc>

		<desc>In Tecmo World Wrestling, you select from 10 fictional wrestlers and compete against the others for the coveted Tecmo World Wrestling Title. When your match begins you'll find you've got all the moves of the pros. You can run, climb to the top ropes, climb outside the ring, pick up your opponent, throw them over the ropes, pin them, and escape from a pin yourself. The wrestlers, such as "The British Star" Rex Beat and "The Technician" Dr. Guildo have a full assortment of professional wrestling moves and holds such as the Pile Driver, Shoulder Throw, Cobra Twist, as well as the ever-popular Slam the Guys Face Into the Metal Post maneuver. 

Before selected matches you'll be able to beef up you're wrestler's strength with three different exercises. The bottom portion of the screen is where the energetic announcer describes what is going on in the ring, move by move.</desc>

		<desc>With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : Tournament Fighters</name>
		<desc>[This item has been split and information may not be complete accurate. Users are cautioned that incorrect information may appear in the description which does not apply to this platform and needs to be revised]

The game features the original 4 turtles from the previous games in the series, as well as other fighters.

The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Casey Jones, or even Shredder.

Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as "fireballs".

The game's modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to defeat the Shredder, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.</desc>

		<desc>[This item has been split and information may not be complete accurate. Users are cautioned that incorrect information may appear in the description which does not apply to this platform and needs to be revised]

The game features the original 4 turtles from the previous games in the series, as well as other fighters.

The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Casey Jones, or even Shredder.

Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as "fireballs".

The game's modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to defeat the Shredder, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles II : The Arcade Game</name>
		<desc>April O'Neil, the reporter friend of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, is kidnapped by the villainous Shredder and his two goons, Bebop and Rocksteady. The four ninja turtles: Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo fight their way through hordes of Foot Soldiers in order to rescue April. They battle familiar foes such as the mad scientist Baxter Stockman, General Traag from Dimension X and the evil alien brain Krang, up to the final showdown with Shredder himself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game is a port of the popular arcade game made by Konami during the height of the cartoon series' popularity. Depending on the version of the game, up to two, three or four players can take part in the action. The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. While most of the standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with knives or ray guns and are thus more dangerous. At the end of each level, players encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses working in tandem, such as Bebop and Rocksteady).

The NES version of the game features additional content not present in other versions of the game: two new levels (Snowy Central Park and The Dojo), new bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter Stockman as a fly), additional music tracks as well as more variations of Foot Soldiers.</desc>

		<desc>This was the last side-scrolling Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game for NES. It followed the highly acclaimed Turtles II over a year later and, unlike its predecessor, doesn't have an Arcade counterpart.

The third game in the series is basically the same as the second. The story and the stages are different, of course, but it doesn't really matter. Choose your favourite turtle and kill as many Foot Clan soldiers as you can, fight the bosses and reach Shredder in a Double Dragon-styled game.

The graphics and gameplay were improved. And, if the choice of the turtle depended only on personal taste in the second game (as they were all the same, in different colors), in this third episode they gained individual special moves.</desc>

		<desc>The Terminator loosely follows the plot of the 1984 Arnold Schwarzenegger film. The game begins in the future, where the hero Kyle Reese must battle through a post-apocalyptic future in order to go back in time to 1984 Los Angeles. Once there, he must progress through various checkpoints as outlined by the main movie plot: Find Sarah Connor, shootout at the police station, and the climax in the factory. The main levels of the game consist of side-scrolling jumping and shooting action. In between levels are car chases where the Terminator attempts to run you down as you race to your next destination.</desc>

Numbered bases release power-ups when shot - these can either be used in combination or (by pressing the space bar) in Formation Mode, covering a wider range of shooting positions. Each pass over the planet ends with a boss; the third and final one with a boss who can only be killed if you are at maximum power. Death puts you back to the start of the world.</desc>

		<name>Tetris</name>
		<desc>This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, as well as the best-known (but not the only) version on Nintendo's first home console. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.

The game offers two different modes of play, "Type A" and "Type B". "Type A" is a standard endless mode, where the speed of the game increases every ten lines, with an option for the starting level when beginning the game. "Type B", on the other hand, is a race to clear 25 lines, with options for both drop speed and starting garbage. In both modes, successful play is rewarded with cute animations. There are also three different background songs to choose from.</desc>

		<name>Tetris : The Soviet Mind Game</name>
		<desc>The drama surrounding Tetris is one of the most storied sagas in the history of the NES. Tengen, an ambitious Atari-associated game developer, began releasing official NES games in 1988. Meanwhile, the company worked rapidly behind the scenes to override Nintendo's infamous lockout device that kept unofficial cartridges from being played on its console. When Tengen released its first unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just the beginning of the Tengen/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely lacked. Today, the game known as Tengen Tetris is a rare title to have in your collection, but it's a worthwhile play. After all, Tetris is one of the classic games not only on the NES, but of all-time.</desc>

		<desc>Unlike the original Tetris, Tetris 2 has you clearing the field of blocks in a different way. Each play field starts with different colored dots (in this case black, gray and white), with one of each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the same three colors, and by matching blocks of the same color over the top or to the side of the dot will clear the dot and those blocks from the screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the corresponding dots of the same color will be cleared. To complete the round just clear the dots, not the blocks themselves.</desc>

		<name>Thunder &amp; Lightning</name>
		<desc>A "Breakout" type game with interesting characters such as Mr. Chin and the Thunder Warrior.  Mr. Chin holds a stick over his head that acts as the paddle.  If your ball hits one of the power-up carriers (Flying Saucer, Submarine or Airplane) you have to try and pick up the released power-up while continuing to keep the ball in play.

Power-ups are:

1. Glove: Catch the ball and then release with the A button.
Long: Mr. Chin's stick will become longer.
1-Up: Get an extra life for Mr. Chin.
Missile: Gain fire power, press the A button to launch a missile, catch a second missile to fire two missiles simultaneously.
Big Ball: The ball enlarges and blows through any type of block in its path.
Slow: This will slow the speed of the ball.
3 Balls: The ball will split into three balls and as long as you keep one ball from falling you will always have three balls.
6 Balls: The ball will split into six balls.

"Bad Characters" will occasionally appear and try to mess with Mr. Chin.

1. Sea Anemone: If he captures your ball it will split into two smaller balls.
Octopus: He lives underwater inside an ancient vase, if the vase is hit by the ball the octopus will come out and try and latch onto Mr. Chin's stick.  If he succeeds he will weigh you down causing you to move slower.
Turtle: They will walk over the wall and transform themselves into new blocks to hinder your progress.
Bird: If hit with your ball it will fly out of control smashing through the walls before flying away.
Thunder Warrior: If you hit the Thunder Warrior with your ball he will release a circle of lightning bolts that will fly around him. The lightning bolts will destroy the walls but they will momentarily paralyze Mr. Chin if he is hit.</desc>

		<desc>An evil alien named Hood wants the Thunderbirds to turn over all their vehicles to him within a 60 day time period or Hood will bombard the Earth with meteors. The Thunderbirds figure he needs the 60 days to prepare to come through with his threat so they decide to go looking for places which may contain his energy sources for his power.

The game takes place over North America, the Indian Ocean, and Asia as you fly through doing different missions in each location.  As a Thunderbird, you'll  fly 5 different futuristic aircraft such as a Mach 20 Thunderbird 1 Rocket, the Neptune Hydro-Turbojet, and the Fire Flash Atomic plane. Each vehicle can only take 3 hits before being grounded. If your vehicle is grounded, it will take 3 days to be repaired. These 3 days will be subtracted from your overall 60 days you have to beat the entire game. 

Your enemies consists of such exotic fare as poisonous space scorpions, mutant sea worms and even environmental adversaries such as fire spitting volcanoes. By defeating certain enemies, you aircraft can gain powerups such as replenishing delpleted heath, increased firepower, or adding orbital ships to fly by the side of your main ship to assist you in combat.</desc>

		<desc>Terrorism has reached new heights. AATOM (Atomic Age Terrorist Organization of Miracali) has constructed their own nuclear power plant, and threaten the world with atomic terror. The world powers have decided to initiate operation THUNDERCADE to stop AATOM. Equipped with a high-performance combat motorcycle, sidecar cannons, and backed by a precision B-7 bomber, you set out on the dangerous mission.

The player controls a motorcycle traveling through four distinct areas; the city, the base, the woodlands and the fortress which contains the final objective which is the nuclear power plant. The motorcycle shoots bullets and can be upgraded by finding powerups which add sidecars to the motorbike, which in turn adds more firepower. Also, you can call in a limited amount of airstrikes  to help you clear the screen of enemy tanks and troops.</desc>

Your goal is to defeat the country of Cantun, which is run by terrorists and has become completely power hungry with an aim to take over the whole world.

You're shooting tanks, ships, aircraft carriers and trains while flying towards the impenetrable military base. You shoot crates to get pickups. If you shoot the crate when it is green you get a bomb pickup, if you shoot it when it is red you get a mini helicopter that attaches to one of your sides shooting sideways, and if you shoot it when it is white you get a mini helicopter shooting forward. If you shoot 10 crates with a yellow diamond shape you get an extra life.</desc>

		<name>Tiles of Fate</name>
		<desc>In Tiles Of Fate the object of the game is to clear the screen of all the tiles within the given time limit. This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges!</desc>

You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.</desc>

It is a platform game with a lot of various levels: jungle, underwater, volcanic caves, on the ice... Toki's only weapons are spitting on the enemies or jumping on them and crashing them. There are many possibilities to upgrade his spitting "weapon";  for example, if he finds an upgrade, he can spit fireballs. 

This game is ported from an older arcade version.</desc>

		<name>Tom &amp; Jerry : The Ultimate Game of Cat and Mouse!</name>
		<desc>This game plays very similar to Chip &amp; Dale's Rescue Rangers.

Tom has mouse-napped Jerry's nephew Tuffy and locked him in a trunk in the attic. You and your furry little buddy Jerry must dash, jump, and climb from the basement up through every level of the house to rescue him in time.

Jerry's main defense is his unlimited supply of marbles. Pick up other items such as bubble gum, meat cleaver, cups of water, moth balls, hammer, invisible ink and drill to overcome the enemies and obstacles in your way. Make sure you outwit Tom whenever he appears.

Look for cheese power-ups and mouse hole bonus stages along the way.</desc>

		<name>ZZZ(notgame):Tommy T's Sound Editor</name>
		<desc>Tommy T's Play Me Sound Editor is a demonstration of Tommy Tallarico's NES sound driver that would later be used in the NES game Color a Dinosaur. It was programmed by Stephen Clarke-Wilson and Tommy Tallarico. The program isn't a complete sound editor, but it does showcase the driver's ability to modify various aspects of the instruments while music is playing. The demo includes three tunes, Flight of the Bumblebee, Two Tone, and Weird.

While it was never officially released, a development time frame can be inferred around 1992 as it was made prior to the release of Color a Dinosaur which occurred in 1993. The original prototype cartridge was found at a swap meet in Orange County California.</desc>

You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.</desc>

		<name>Top Gun</name>
		<desc>Top Gun is loosely based on the film of the same name. It is an action game in which the player controls an F-14 Tomcat fighter through four different missions.

The action is seen from a first-person cockpit view. Depending on the mission, different kinds of targets must be destroyed. There are always enemy aircraft, but some missions include sea and ground targets as well. Two weapons are available: machine guns (with unlimited ammunition) and missiles. The player can choose from three types of missiles before a mission: the more powerful ones can only be carried in lower quantities.

Enemy aircraft either overshoot the players's plane from behind and can be easily taken down, or they come from the front and fire guns and missiles. Sometimes, an enemy plane will position itself on the player's six. It should be lost quickly by steering left and right, or instant death follows.

Halfway through missions two through four comes a refueling sequence where the fuel plane's nozzle must be aligned with one's aircraft.

Every mission (except the first one) features a final mission target, which can take a lot more damage than regular targets.

Each mission concludes with a landing attempt on the aircraft carrier. To successfully land, the player's plane must have a certain altitude and speed. Successfully landing gives bonus points, but crashing the plane doesn't end the game - it simply costs a life.</desc>

		<name>Top Gun : The Second Mission</name>
		<desc>Just like in the first game, you fly an F-14 Tomcat in combat against the enemy equipped with Soviet equipment, although there is no direct reference to the Soviet Union anywhere. The only plot of this game is to destroy everything you see, excluding the aircraft carrier to which you must land at the end of each level.

In addition to the basic game mode with anti-ship, ground attack and space battle levels, similar to the first game, the second mission adds two extra modes. In the first extra mode you can fight against top enemy aces flying a MiG-25 Foxbat, one at a time. The second extra mode is two-player game with split screen, in which you can fight against your friend, both flying Tomcats.

You will have to fight against interesting level bosses such as a giant Tu-160 Blackjack bomber, a Mi-24 Hind attack chopper and an armed space shuttle.

Another interesting detail about the game is that between fighting the aircraft and surface opponents you have to dodge between giant trees (yes, you read correctly!!), lightnings and laser attacks.</desc>

		<name>Total Recall</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1990 Schwarzenegger film of the same name, Total Recall for the NES generally adheres to the movie's plot across its nine levels. Unlike the various PC iterations, this title was created by Interplay and published by Acclaim.

Players control Doug Quaid as he platform hops across Earth and Mars in search of his stolen memories and the responsible parties. A collection of police, soldiers, and creatures will try to stop him. Quaid's default attack is a strong punch, though guns can be knocked away from some guards and picked up for use. Cutscenes between certain levels tell the movie's plot, and feature likenesses of the actors from the film (including Arnold).

Sequences in the film are also replicated more tightly than in the PC versions. Quaid will be chased by henchman Richter in the first level, and must battle his wife inside their apartment. The security x-ray scanner takes up a level, as does the subway battle after. The player will also commandeer a Martian taxi for a driving level inside the colony, and windows can be shot out on Mars, sucking out any unfortunate baddies nearby.</desc>

		<name>Totally Rad</name>
		<desc>Totally Rad is an action-adventure game in which you play Jake, a magician wannabe being trained by the Master Magician Zebediah. One day, during his training, Jake is attacked by surprise by unknown foes who kidnap Allison, his girlfriend. Then, Jake has to save her and discover what lies behind that attack.

This game is a side-scrolling one, with the basic controls common to many of those games that fall in the same category: moving, jumping and shooting. Your basic weapon is something like an energy ball that can be charged by holding the button for a few seconds until its maximum power. Although Jake is supposed to still be learning his magic from Zebediah, from the very beginning you can use all his magical powers. You can select which magic you want to use from a list, displayed when you press the start button. The magical powers available include healing, time stopping, invincibility, the power of the elements (fire, watter, wind and earth) and 3 different metamorphosis. You can morph into a flying guy who throws something like a boomerang (that doesn't come back), a fish-like guy, who throws something like ninja stars and can swim, and a feline-like guy, who releases electrical shocks from his hands and becomes invincible while jumping. You do not evolve during the game, as your health and magic bar doesn't grow.

Totally Rad, as the name points out, is a game full of slang, with the constant use of words like totally, gnarly, dude, excellent, decent, righteous, etc.</desc>

		<desc>Touchdown Fever is an arcade football game from SNK.  Go head-to-head against the computer or a human opponent, or team up with another human player vs. the computer.  Choose five, ten, or fifteen minute quarters for either league match (single game) or tournament play.

There are 12 teams from NFL cities to play with (six East, six West), although there is no NFL license and no real NFL players.  Offensive plays can be run from five basic formations: long pass, short pass, quarterback sneak, running backs, and field goal kick/punt.  There are no formations or plays on defense, but there are two possible players (A or B button) to take control of before the snap.  The player perspective is top-down and vertical-scrolling.  Standard football scoring rules: most points after four quarters wins!</desc>

		<name>Radia Senki - Reimeihen</name>
		<desc>You wake up in the middle of a forest. Your head hurts. You don't remember anything: you don't know who you are, and you vaguely recall your name. A man approaches you and says his name is Darus. After realizing that you are suffering from a strange amnesia, Darus takes you to a nearby village and soon reveals to you that he is a sorcerer on a quest for revenge. You join forces, and soon become involved in a complex mystery of a kidnapped princess, the destruction of the world, and search for your own identity...

Radia Senki is set in a semi-modern, semi-medieval environment, and introduces an unusual blend between action and strategic RPG. During the pre-set (not random) battles, your party and the enemies can freely move around the battle screen. You control the main character by attacking in real time, but you can pause at any time and give a command to other party members: attack a specified enemy, be offensive in general, use a healing or other technique, pretend to be dead, etc.</desc>

		<name>Town &amp; Country Surf Designs : Thrilla's Surfari</name>
		<desc>In order to restore his immortal powers, Wazula, an evil Kahuna, is ordered to travel to Hawaii to kidnap Barbi Bikini. Barbi Bikini happens to be Thrilla Gorilla's girlfriend so now he's off to Africa so he can rescue her.

The game features 7 worlds each containing 5 stages (except for the 1st and 3rd world where each contain only 4 stages). Most of the game involves controlling Thrilla on a skateboard, dodging or jumping over various obstacles and enemies while attempting to get to the end of the stage. There will also be times when Thrilla will get to be on a surfboard, but gameplay remains the same as it was on the skateboard. Thrilla also rides a shark underwater with the goal still being to get to the end of the stage while either dodging enemies or throwing spears at them. There are also boss battles where Thrilla throws either coconuts or spears trying to deplete all the health of his adversary. 

There is also a shell game between stages which allows the player to obtain extra lives. The game also contains powerups throughout its levels such as a banana which restores health.</desc>

		<name>Town &amp; Country Surf Designs : Wood &amp; Water Rage</name>
		<desc>T&amp;C Surf Designs features both skateboarding and surfing games. The skating section (called Street Skate Session) is a side scrolling action game where you need to navigate through an obstacle course within the given time limit. Ideally you want to earn as many points as possible by performing tricks, jumping over items, and collecting bonuses. If you crash too many times (or fall into a hole, run out of time, etc...) then the game will be over. In the surfing section (called Big Wave Encounter) you need to surf a giant wave all the way to the beach. As with skating, you can earn points by performing tricks and collecting bonuses; likewise the game ends if you crash too many times. You can choose to play either game individually, or alternate between the two (the Wood &amp; Water Rage option). You can select several T&amp;C Surf Designs characters to play as, including Thrilla Gorilla, Kool Kat, Joe Cool, and Tiki Man.</desc>

		<desc>Based on Troma's cartoon series of the same name,  the Toxic Crusaders protect the city of Tromaville against the plots of the alien Dr. Killemoff and his Radiation Rangers. That is, until Killemoff captures all of the Toxic Crusaders save one. As Toxie, you must "mop up" Killemoff's forces through 6 levels and rescue his comrades before it's too late.

The game is action-oriented. Toxie's only abilities are to jump and to punch his way through enemies. He initially starts with a mop weapon, which can be easily lost.</desc>

		<name>Track &amp; Field</name>
		<desc>Track &amp; Field is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. It is based on an arcade game of the same name. Events include 100 meter dash, hammer throw, the long jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The NES version adds skeet shooting, triple jump, javelin throw, high jump, and archery as events but loses the hammer throw event. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If you want to go to the next event or round then you will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

		<desc>Treasure Master is a side-scrolling action game that sends your character on a quest of treasure acquisition. Jump your way through a variety of world environments including the islands, microprocessor-level circuitry, and the moon, and accumulate all of the material wealth you can possibly amass. You have a number of enemies to beware of (such as sharks, caterpillars, and springs). But you also have an impressive array of tools to help you in your quest (moon buggy!).

Treasure Master offers the opportunity to collect not only virtual treasure in a video game, but also treasure in the real world. After practicing the game, players had the opportunity to compete for real prizes.</desc>

		<desc>Long ago, back in the days of cavemen and dinosaurs, there was a land called Og.  In this land, hungry one-eyed cavemen, called Trogs, loved the taste of eggs.  However, two Dino-Mites, Spike and Bloop, were determined to rescue the eggs from certain doom!

Up to two players can play in a race to gather up the Trog eggs as quickly as possible.  The first player to get all eggs of their colour wins the round.  Of course, Trogs also love the taste of Spike and Bloop, and will use cavemen inventions such as fire and the wheel to catch them and gobble them up!  Luckily, the Dinos can fight back - eating a pineapple will turn them into a monstrous T-Rex that can chow down on Trogs, while a hot tamale lets them breathe fire.</desc>

		<desc>The world is ruled by a vicious warlord named Achiless and his henchmen. You are Ryu, the master of martial arts and sword-fighting, who has decided that a confrontation with Achilles is in order to bring peace and order back to the world. Your character is equipped with both a sword (for offense) and a shield (for defense). You will go through six stages starting at a ruined city, each with two boss characters (in the middle and at the end). Some enemies are so powerful that you will die the instant you fail to block. You also have to race against time as well, which makes the game that much more difficult.</desc>

		<name>Trolls on Treasure Island</name>
		<desc>Samantha and Norbert, two teenage troll twins, were windsurfing one day and came upon an undiscovered and uncharted island. They recalled that once long ago their grandfather had told them of an island that contained lost treasures. So the twin trolls decide to explore the island to see if they can obtain these treasures.

Trolls on Treasure Island involves the same type of gameplay found in Dudes with Attitude. In this puzzle game, the player controls one of the trolls as they bounce back and forth across the screen trying to acquire the jewels on the playfield. The one caveat is that the players troll has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, the player has to bounce across a paint can that will change your trolls hair to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time.

The game offers 32 levels to navigate through and the player is also able to create their own level with the custom level editor.

This is an unlicensed NES game.</desc>

		<desc>Conversion of the Toaplan original game, this conversion is based on the Japanese 1 player version (Ultimate Tiger).

You pilot the TC-17 Twin Cobra assault helicopter to fight the forces of Commander Anziga, the myopic leader of the nation of Kaban. Your job is to fly into Kaban and take out the entire military base of Commander Anziga.

You will fight small helicopters, tanks and stationary guns, defeat the large helicopters to get power-ups. By picking up colored icons (blue, yellow, red or green) you can change to different weapon types. Blue is a forward spread shot, yellow is a four-way shot, red is a wide forward laser shot and green is a continuous forward laser shot.

At the end of each section, you land on a carrier ship and count up your bonuses.</desc>

		<desc>The South Pacific contains some of the most beautiful islands in the world, and they have all been invaded by a terrorist organization called DAMED (Destructive Armed Militant Enemy Devotee). You must fly an experimental fighter jet called the Thrasher Hawk-7 to battle the enemy and rid them from nine different islands. To help out, six different power ups can be collected after destroying certain enemies which provide better weapons, bombs, or extra lives.</desc>

		<name>Uforce Power Games</name>
		<desc>The NintendoAge community was able to rise enough money to obtain and share a rom of the cancelled NES game ?U-Force Power Games?. In this multicart, you'll be able to experience the only games designed specifically for the U-Force controller. Included are the games Hose 'Em Down, Nuclear Rat Attack, Rock on Air, and Power Field B-Ball. 
In Hose 'Em Down you are in charge of a fire hose in front of a burning building. As people appear at the windows you must slowly lower them with your water blast. Go too slow and they burn to death!
Pink mutant rats are attacking your reactor in Nuclear Rat Attack. If you don't kill them fast enough they fry and meltdown the system! 
Rock on Air turns your U-Force into a theremin and lets you create music. Wave your hands around so your friends think you are crazy!
Think sports games where you just hit a button are too easy? Power Field B-Ball challenges you by having no buttons! Added two player mode with one U-Force controller ensures the hilarity doesn't stop. 
Much more than a reproduction, this original game cartridge is built using all new parts. No donor carts were harmed in the making of this game.</desc>

		<desc>Ufouria is a (side scrolling) platform adventure video game. You begin play as Hebereke (Bop Louie in PAL regions), a penguin (though in PAL release he is more humanoid and looks like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man), and must explore the world on which you and three other friends crash landed. As you encounter the new characters you must fight them to make them recover their memory.  Once you have recovered all 3 other characters you are then searching for Temple Keys which will lead back to your homeworld of Ufouria.

The world in which you interact is free form, meaning that you can wander around as you please. To get to new areas you will need to get power-ups and/or new characters with their own abilities. Character switching is done as needed, not defined by levels.  Sections of the game have bosses and mini-bosses which include the characters which have not had their memory returned yet.</desc>

		<name>Ultima : Exodus</name>
		<desc>The third title in the Ultima series, this was the first game in the series to feature a party of adventurers instead of a single player. It also had large, detailed towns with many people to talk to, and a separate combat engine where your party fought multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system.

The story? After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named "Exodus" before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon you the hero to find and stop him.</desc>

		<desc>Following the defeat of the evil triad in the previous three Ultima games, the world of Sosaria changed beyond recognition: continents rose and sank, and new cities were built, heralding the advent of a different civilization. Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.</desc>

		<desc>Ultima V uses the basics of the Ultima IV engine, an overhead perspective of Britannia or one of many towns or dungeons, which use a rosette-compass 3D view. Many actions are expanded, including much more world interactivity and much deeper characters than the 'signpost' NPCs of Ultima IV.

In Ultima V, you, the Avatar and Hero of Britannia, are called back to deal with a new threat - the tyrant Blackthorn, who, after the disappearance of Lord British, now rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. Behind Blackthorn are the Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three Principles. Their meaning and origin are explored later in the game, rounding out an immersive world and very meaningful plot.</desc>

		<name>Ultimate League Soccer</name>
		<desc>In this soccer game, two players can play a single match between any of the 8 teams available, or one player can play either one of the two championships available.

The Ultimate League Soccer championship let the player choose one of 8 national teams: France, England, United States, Argentina, Italy, Brazil, Australia or Germany. The other championship available restricts the choice to the 4 first teams: France, England, United States and Argentina. Each national team has its own characteristics, varying in offensive, defense, speed, skill, accuracy and experience traits.

After selecting the team, players are prompted to choose the color of their team's uniform, among white, green, gray and red. They are also prompted to choose the duration of the periods (15, 30 or 45 minutes - which run faster than real time). They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.

The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective. While conducting the ball layers can make short passes (with button B) or strong kicks (with button A, stronger the longer the button is held). Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.

Players can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.</desc>

		<name>The Ultimate Stuntman</name>
		<desc>Dr. Evil has kidnapped the scientist Jenny Aykroyd and it's the Ultimate Stuntman's job to rescue her.

Ultimate Stuntman must fight through 7 worlds with 4 stages each and then through the final world which consists of 3 stages. The game has a variety of different gameplay types. The stages go in the order of an overhead view stage, a side-scrolling stage, a climbing stage with the Android boss, and then a bomb disposal stage.

The overhead view stages deal with you driving either a car, boat, glider, or a dune buggy and trying to get to the end before time runs out on the clock. You must do this while either dodging or shooting enemies. In all the stages besides the one where you're given a glider you can use a limited number of turbo boosts to speed up your vehicle. In the glider stages you can alter your altitude to either go high above or below various obstacles. All of these levels end with a boss battle.

Sometimes after these stages there is a bonus round where you try to collect extras in a limited amount of time without crashing into any obstacles. Completing this successfully will yield an extra life.

The side-scrolling stages consists of two different experiences. One is a platformer where you walk around and can shoot enemies while searching for a set number of keys to unlock a forcefield at the end of the stage. The other consists of you flying a glider throughout a stage shooting enemies and trying not to crash until you get to the end of the stage.

The climbing stages consist of you climbing a building and shooting enemies with a reticle that you can move all over the screen.You have to get to the top of the building before time runs out. Once at the top you will have to fight an android boss. Such as Mega Slug, Techno Beast, and the Sand Yeti. The android boss fights take place on the buildings rooftops with a side view of the action. The player must drain the energy from the androids by repeated shooting bullets into them.

In the bomb disposal stage you must dispose of a bomb before the fuse burns all the way detonating it. You dispose the bomb by unsoldering chips away from each other. The player must use the directional pad to move the cursor from chip to chip keeping an eye on the number on each one. Every time the cursor moves to a certain block, the number on it decreases by one. This creates a puzzle-like scenario, where if the player makes a mistake he must reset the disposal and try again with less time.</desc>

		<desc>Professor Xavier and his Uncanny X-Men are all that stand in the way of the rampage of Magneto and his henchmen. The X-Men: Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Iceman and Nightcrawler, are ready to fight Magneto.

The Uncanny X-Men is an over-head view action game. Players begin by choosing two X-Men from the roster (the second either controlled by another player or the computer) and select one of five levels including a practice level. The goal in each level is to reach the hidden 'command center' and destroy it. The X-Men all share similar abilities, being able to move in any direction, jump and attack. Half of the characters (Storm, Iceman, Cyclops) have long range attacks while the other half (Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus) must get in close range to punch the enemies. Each X-men can only sustain a certain number of hits before being defeated. Should the two X-Men both fall in battle, players will be able to choose two more to attempt the level again until all of the X-Men are used up.

Power-ups include an "S" which stops time, invincibility for a short time and a health restore. There is also a Magnet (symbol of Magneto) power-down which renders the X-men immobile for a short time.</desc>

Along the way, you may be called upon by merchants and royalty to do specific tasks. Several different nations as well as pirates roam the sea and not all have good relations with one another. You can take as long as you want and explore as much of the world as possible to complete your ultimate task of marrying Christiana, which will require your fame rating to be quite high anyway.

The only place he could have gone is a creepy old mansion which looms in front of you. With nowhere else to go, you enter the mansion in search of your brother. It turns out the mansion once belonged to an old wizard and his apprentice, and somehow it has become infested with the Undead.</desc>

When you regain consciousness, you find that your brother is missing (in the NES-Version it's your sister who is missing). The only place he could have gone is a creepy old mansion which looms in front of you. With nowhere else to go, you enter the mansion in search of your brother. It turns out the mansion once belonged to an old wizard and his apprentice, and somehow it has become infested with the Undead.</desc>

The game features 7 levels of action named The Street, The Warehouse, The Bridge, The Alleys, The Train station, The Hostage, and The Rooftop. Some of the levels feature traditional jumping and shooting action. Other levels pit you against the gangsters in a first person shooter-style of gameplay where your character begins behind a wall, wraps around into an open area, and must take out the bad guys. When your character runs out of ammo, he slips back behind the wall to reload. These levels are accompanied with time limits and goals for the number of enemies you must kill.</desc>

		<desc>Two rival characters meet up one day on the city streets and arrange a fight. Both characters will start in the middle with two blocks on either side of them leading to an open manhole. The first person to knock the other into the open manhole is the winner. Only punches are allowed, although obstacles such as falling flower pots can occur and give one player the advantage. Also, everyone is to look innocent should the police drive by.

This is a very early and simplistic fighting game. As mentioned, each player can only punch the other, trying to knock them off the screen and towards one of the waiting manholes.</desc>

		<name>Vice : Project Doom</name>
		<desc>Quinn Hart and his partner, Detective Reese of the VICE squad both work to stop the trafficking of illegal substances. But something new has appeared on the scene, a neon gel with great addictive properties. During investigations as to the origin of the gel, Reese mysteriously disappears and leaves Hart without a lead. Time passes and Hart becomes romantically involved with his new partner, Christy, as he continues trying to track down the gel. But Hart is about to get a brand new lead...

Vice: Project Doom is a game that features both overhead driving modes and side-scrolling platform adventure sequences. Hart's vehicle can accelerate or slow down and fire his weapon straight ahead. During side-scrolling sequences, Hart can jump, duck, climb or use his selected weapon. Weapons that can be selected include a Katana sword, a pistol and a grenade-type weapon. These weapons feature limited ammunition with the exception of the katana. Power-ups include ammunition, coins, and health.

During both of these sequences, Hart must fight and maneuver his way past enemy foes to confront a boss. By destroying the boss and completing the level, Hart progresses and learns a bit more about the origins of the neon gel and what Project Doom is all about. Cinematics dialog between the levels tell the tale in a style similar to that of Ninja Gaiden.</desc>

		<desc>The Tangent Empire are preparing to attack the earth with their convoy of tanks, and it is you who has been sent forward to destroy the 14 space stations which make up the potential invasion threat.

There are 3 sub-levels on each station, which can be played in any order. The action scrolls in every direction, with you guiding your tank-link droid around to shoot the opposition droids. The tank takes a while to steer, making it initially harder to avoid contact with those enemies. Each level contains energy stars, which can be traded in for upgrades such as improved weapons and extra speed after each level.</desc>

		<name>Wacky Races</name>
		<desc>Despite what the name implies, Wacky Races for NES is not a racing game, and has nothing to do with the other games bearing the same name but the license. In this game, the player takes control of Muttley, the grumbling, but loyal dog from the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon. His master Dastardly sends his on three different missions, each taking place in a different location, which in its turn is divided into smaller levels. 

Muttley has to complete those levels in a rather standard platformer fashion, moving from left to right, jumping, overcoming obstacles and fighting various creatures and boss enemies from the cartoon movie. The dog's primary weapon is, unsurprisingly, his own mouth - biting regular enemies will usually lead to their instant death. Muttley can also collect bones scattered across the levels, which will grant him powerful weapons and skills of limited use, such as a bomb, a projectile attack, and the ability to heal.</desc>

The Benedict family has extremely high standards, and you have to prove that you can make that fortune even larger on the stock market before it will be given to you. In addition, you must exercise regularly to stay healthy, and keep your girlfriend happy by pampering her frequently with gifts. 

The game features a stock trading engine that is fairly simple to jump into. Buy stocks as you see fit, and finish the day. The next morning, you will find out whether your assets grew or not. If they didn't, you most likely need to invest in something else.</desc>

		<name>Wally Bear and the No! Gang</name>
		<desc>Wally Bear needs to find all of his friends for the party at his parents house, but he has an awful lot of obstacles to overcome! Riding a skateboard through the streets he must dodge dive-bombing pigeons, rabid bull dogs, and anthropomorphic animals who want to get him hooked on drugs and jumped into a gang. Worst of all: he's got to beat the curfew as well!

Wally Bear and the NO! Gang is a side-scrolling platformer designed to teach kids the dangers of doing drugs, gang banging and hanging out with the wrong crowd. Most obstacles can be avoided, but Wally can also bop enemies on the head with his skateboard. The game features seven levels to traverse and a total of two power ups to find all while racing against the clock to help out your friends.</desc>

		<desc>War On Wheels is a two-player skating game developed by Sculptured Software in 1991 that allowed gamers to physically assault anyone they couldn't out-skate. Reviews of the game exist in magazines of the time, though no one seems to have any idea why a title so close to completion was canned.</desc>

		<name>Wario's Woods</name>
		<desc>Wario's Woods is a puzzle game similar to Tetris or Columns, but with a twist. Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.
There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.</desc>

		<name>Wayne's World</name>
		<desc>Wayne's World is an adventure game based on the movie with the same name. The game itself is a classic point and click adventure, and should not be confused with the platform game based on the movie.

You play both Wayne and Garth, and you can switch between them at any time. The plot is simple; In an attempt to save their tv-show, Wayne and Garth decide to hold a pizza-thon (a charity show with a pizza-theme) in order to raise money. In order to be able to hold the pizza-thon Wayne and Garth must embark on several quests to collect items and hire people they need for the show. The adventure includes participating in babe-jeopardy, joining a biker's gang and baking pizza. The graphics are in 2D and the sound contains several samples from the movie.</desc>

		<name>WCW World Championship Wrestling</name>
		<desc>WCW: World Championship Wrestling is an isometric  wrestling game of the National Wrestling Alliance. 
Players can choose to engage in one- or two-player matches as either 1vs1 solo bouts or 2vs2 tag-teams. Upon selecting a mode, players choose their characters from among twelve featured wrestlers from the NWA league. Licensed characters include: Rick Flair ("Nature Boy"), Sting, Lex Luger ("Total Package"), Mike Rotunda, Road Warrior Hawk, Road Warrior Animal, Steve Williams (""Dr. Death"), Kevin Sullivan ("Gamemaster"), Ricky Steamboat ("The Dragon"), Ric Steiner ("Dogface Gremlin"), Eddie Gilbert ("Hotstuff") and Michael P.S. Hayes. Each wrestler has unique abilities not shared by the other wrestlers, including finishing moves and rope toss.

Prior to a match, the player is presented with a menu of eight "moves", of which the player chooses four to assign to the points of the directional pad. Once the match starts, the player is only able to use the four moves selected and the rope toss to attack the opponent. Each wrestler can move up, down, left and right inside the wrestling ring, climb the turnstiles at each corner and throw opponents out of the ring (where they will be disqualified if outside for 20 seconds). Each wrestler has a high damage "finisher move" which can only be performed when they are standing in the middle of the ring and the opponent's stamina bar is low.</desc>

		<name>Werewolf : The Last Warrior</name>
		<desc>An evil leader and his gang of bio-engineered monsters has taken over the land and only one man stands in their way. Only he's not a man, he is a lycanthrope, a person able to transform into a terrible werewolf to let loose his anger.

You start the game in human form. The human can punch, jump, move and shoot a powered up shot which moves horizontally across the screen.  By finding a Red "W" icon, the human is able to transform into a mighty werewolf creature. Accidentally grabbing a blue "W" icon or losing too much energy will change you back into a mere human being. The werewolf form offers higher jumps, quicker speed, greater strength, a shockwave attack and the ability to climb walls, so naturally you'll want this form whenever possible.  Additionally the werewolf form has an anger meter that is augmented by collecting orbs. After 5 such orbs, the werewolf will transform yet again into a SUPER werewolf with even greater strength, speed and partial invincibility.

There are 5 stages in all. Each with a boss who moves in a distinct pattern.</desc>

		<desc>Whomp 'Em tells the tale of a little Native American Indian named Soaring Eagle who is on a quest to fill his magic pouch with totems. These totems are guarded by fearsome bosses at the end of different environments spread throughout the land. Each totem gives Soaring Eagle a new power to help him complete his journey.

Whomp 'Em is a side scrolling action platformer. The hero can run, jump, and attack with his spear. Not only can he jab forward with his spear, Soaring Eagle can also stab upwards or downwards while jumping. Further, he can use his spear to defend from attacks coming from above.

Soaring Eagle must first conquer a bossless, introductory level. From there, he is free to choose from among 6 different lands to explore: Fire test, ice ritual, secret cliff, water test, magic forest, and sacred woods. Each level is highly unique with its own dangerous enemies and lethal boss. After completing these 6 areas and collecting the associated totems, Soaring Eagle is whisked off to a cloud realm where he must use all of his accumulated power to defeat a much larger enemy.</desc>

		<name>Willow</name>
		<desc>Willow is an action RPG based on the movie with the same name. The player assumes the role of Willow, the chosen one who must restore human form to the benevolent sorceress Fin Raziel and destroy the evil sorceress, Bavmorda. While the game follows the movie's plot somewhat most of the time, it also expands on it and introduces characters, races and enemies not found in the movie.

Gameplay is similar to other action RPGs and The Legend of Zelda. Willow is seen from a top down perspective and all enemies are visible on screen. Slaying enemies will give Willow experience points, which will eventually lead to him increasing his stats automatically. New weapons, shields and magic items are found in various treasure chests scattered across the land or given to Willow as part of the plot. Aside from battling minor enemies Willow will also face off against several boss monsters as well as characters from the movie.</desc>

		<name>Win, Lose or Draw</name>
		<desc>Win, Lose or Draw was a popular TV show requiring artistic skills and an ability to think laterally. A player on your team draws something on the big game board, and you must work out what it represents. They will be common expressions depicted literally, such as 'bright idea' showing a light bulb over somebody's head, and 'cabin fever' as a rickety building next to a man with a thermometer in his mouth. 

In this computerised implementation the drawing phase of the game is handled by the computer, so your task is simply to guess the meaning of the picture by thinking laterally. Your team has 60 seconds, and you can guess repeatedly, but the picture takes time to take shape. If you fail to guess correctly, the opposition has 15 seconds to guess it (with a single try) to steal the money.</desc>

		<name>Wizardry : Knight of Diamonds, The Second Scenario</name>
		<desc>Wizardry: Knight of Diamonds is the sequel to Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. It is exactly the same as its predecessor; a tile, or grid based movement, first-person RPG starting out within the Castle that serves as the base for party management and the Maze in which the adventure takes place. Party size is limited to six members, although smaller parties are even allowed but not suggested for survival. The player must find penetrate the dangers and mysteries of the Maze in order to recover the pieces of armor that had once belonged to the Knight of Diamonds.

Unlike the original PC version, characters cannot be imported from the first game and a new party must be created. The game begins with 6 default characters already created and outfitted, so the player can build a full party and enter the maze immediately. However, the player may also choose to create their own characters with the desired race, alignment, stats, class, and equipment.</desc>

		<name>Wizardry : Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</name>
		<desc>The first Wizardry game was one of the original CRPG dungeon crawlers, and stands along with  Ultima and  Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. You generate and control a party of up to six different adventurers and send them into a 3D vector dungeon to fight monsters and find treasure.

The game takes place in the domain of Trebor, the titular Mad Overlord. Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.</desc>

		<name>Wizards &amp; Warriors III : Kuros...Visions of Power</name>
		<desc>The third installment of Wizards &amp; Warriors for the NES divulges during the intro that the evil wizard Malkil was not actually vanquished at the end of the second game. In fact, after the mighty battle with the hero Kuros, Malkil retreated to a nearby self-contained castle kingdom and conducted a hostile takeover. Kuros comes on the scene and must attempt to relieve Malkil of his ill-gotten command of the kingdom, its subjects, and especially its princesses.

The third game in the Wizards &amp; Warriors NES franchise features a similar feel to the first two games in that Kuros' movements are very quick and nimble. The player also has the ability to control Kuros' sword swing movements. However, Kuros has three different character classes to alternate between-- the knight, the thief, and the wizard. Each represents trade-offs between speed, attack strength, and defense strength. There are various guilds throughout the game devoted to training knights, thieves, and wizards where the player must complete challenging obstacle courses in order to increase their character class level.

The gameplay proceeds up a large vertical city/castle with dangerous, monster-filled hallways and caverns. Kuros must kill monsters, gather money, buy goods and services, raise his character class levels, rescue a variety of apprehended princesses and gather special jewels, all in a quest to face off with Malkil once again.</desc>

		<desc>Wonderland Dizzy For NES HERE AT LAST - its only taken Codemasters (aherm) 20 years to get this bad boy developed and released, well technically NOT Codemasterr...

While the original game series, which included the first game, its sequels Treasure Island Dizzy and Fantasy World Dizzy, was developed by twins Andrew and Philip Oliver, future sequels came under the wings of Big Red Software. However, the lads didn't just stop with those three Dizzy games, they were also working on a fourth and final game by the name of Wonderland Dizzy which unfortunately was never released. This game was supposed to be released for NES in 1993.</desc>

		<name>World Champ : Super Boxing Great Fight</name>
		<desc>World Champ is a boxing game that has many similarities to Data East's Ring King. You can play a one player "Ranking" mode, where you can build your boxer's stats up while climbing the ladder to eventually challenge for a championship in one of the four weight classes. There is also a two player vs. mode where you and a friend can square off. A tournament mode allows up to 8 players participate in a bracketed tournament.

Gameplay consists of each boxer moving around the ring trying to land jabs, hooks, and uppercuts. The goal is to either knock your opponent out for a 10-count or have the most points on the scorecard at the end of the allotted amount of rounds.</desc>

		<name>World Class Track Meet</name>
		<desc>This is a track and field game for up to six players requiring the Power Pad. Only a maximum of  two players can play together on the pad at the same time. There are several events: 100m dash, long jump, 110m hurdles and the triple jump. When you beat the computer in the single player mode, you move on to a faster opponent. The AI opponents are (slowest to fastest): Turtle, Bear, Horse, Rabbit, Bobcat and Cheetah. With each defeated opponent, you earn a medal or a trophy. The harder the opponent, the better the award.

Olympics is a 1-6 player event in which you will do all four events in a row. At the end, the computer will show you a total score. There is one player at a time in the jumping events and two at the same time (for two or more human players) in running events.

This game was sold as a pack-in cart with the Power Pad accessory, and as a 3-in-1 cartridge with Duck Hunt and Super Mario Bros.</desc>

Four different Wurms have already been dispatched and mysteriously disappeared, so a fifth Wurm vehicle is ready to launch crewed by the best and the brightest. Crew Chief Moby has been chosen to lead the mission, even though she has lost both her love and father on previous Wurm missions. It will be up to her and the crew to figure out this mystery and rescue the other Wurm members. There's also a matter of mysterious crystals that have been found underground...</desc>

		<desc>WWF Wrestlemania is the WWF's (now WWE) first foray into the Nintendo Entertainment System. This game puts you in the boots of the biggest stars of the time such as Andre The Giant, Hulk Hogan, and Randy Savage. Each of the six wrestlers has his own special strengths and abilities.

You choose from several different ways to play including Tournament action where you pick the wrestler of your choice and then battle the other five in timed matches. If you've got two to six players you can go for the best tournament action. The wrestler with the most wins at the end of the Tournament is the champ and gets to wear the coveted solid-gold WWF Championship Title.</desc>

		<desc>Xenos.  The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart.  A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>

		<name>Xexyz</name>
		<desc>It's the year 2777. Due to nuclear wars and natural disasters, Earth's population has decreased dramatically and only five island are left, forming the nation of Xexyz. In Xexyz, humans, spirits and faeries have lived peacefully for centuries under the reign of King Xeu Star. One day, Xexyz is attacked by Goruza who murders the king, builds mechanical castles on each island and captures the queen of each island. You take on the role of a soldier named Apollo who wants to put an end to Goruza's reign.

Controlling Apollo, it is your task to free all five islands. Freeing an island is done in several different phases that feature 'Jump'n Shoot' as well as 'Shooter' levels (called "Action Mode" and "Shooting Mode"). The first level of each island is a Jump'n Shoot level that contains many doors to shops, bonus games, friendly NPCs or mid-bosses. NPCs will sometimes give you important hints, items or weapons; bonus games can be played to win some money ("Balls"); defeating mid-bosses (and thereby freeing a Fairy) will get you a cash reward and shops also offer weapons and items. Weapons differ largely in attack power and range. Items have temporary effects such as invincibility or improved jumping abilities. In an island's first level, you will have to find a secret room and defeat a boss, for which you will receive a Force Star that is needed to gain access to a mechanical castle. Mechanical castles look similar to other Jump'n Shoot levels but are more complex.

Once you have made your way to a "Cyborg Rider", a self-scrolling Shooter sequence starts in which you have to shoot your way through lots of enemies while picking up speed and weapon power-ups.
At the end of this sequence you will leave the Cyborg Rider, and step onto a floating platform for a boss fight. After the boss is defeated, another Shooter sequence with another boss at the end awaits, but this time, the boss if fought from the Cyborg Rider. After defeating this boss, you start the process over with a Jump'n Shoot level.</desc>

		<desc>The Legend of Yeah Yeah Beebiss I

Long ago there was legend of a new video game that had no screenshots, no reviews, no advertisements -- nothing. Just a quick blurb in the back of some magazines saying it was for sale. It was never released. This is a sequel to that mythical game.

As Kyonshi Hui and Jiangshi Bo, it is your quest to banish all evil in all 100 levels - 10 original stages, including the boss -- a mutated mass of pure evil. Hui prefers zapping foes while Bo prefers absorbing their life force.

Yeah Yeah Beebiss II is a new retro homebrew game created as a love letter to the whole retro game scene!

Fight your way through various platforming arcade levels and avoid obstacles such as spikes and enemies on the ground below. Use the platforms to avoid being hit and use your zap ability to defeat the enemies and raise your high score! You'll eventually face off against bosses and never ending waves of enemies as you try to defeat one. 

You can team up via local co-op and get through the levels with a little help from a friend! With controller support, you both can play in various styles of setup.</desc>

		<desc>The Legend of Yeah Yeah Beebiss I

Long ago there was legend of a new video game that had no screenshots, no reviews, no advertisements -- nothing. Just a quick blurb in the back of some magazines saying it was for sale. It was never released. This is a sequel to that mythical game.

As Kyonshi Hui and Jiangshi Bo, it is your quest to banish all evil in all 100 levels - 10 original stages, including the boss -- a mutated mass of pure evil. Hui prefers zapping foes while Bo prefers absorbing their life force.

Yeah Yeah Beebiss II is a new retro homebrew game created as a love letter to the whole retro game scene!

Fight your way through various platforming arcade levels and avoid obstacles such as spikes and enemies on the ground below. Use the platforms to avoid being hit and use your zap ability to defeat the enemies and raise your high score! You'll eventually face off against bosses and never ending waves of enemies as you try to defeat one. 

You can team up via local co-op and get through the levels with a little help from a friend! With controller support, you both can play in various styles of setup.</desc>

In this game, a young Indiana Jones embarks on globetrotting adventures in which he gathers treasure and fights for what is good and right.

The game features side-scrolling action where young Indy trots along the ground, jumps, crawls flat, and can collect and wield a variety of weapons against copious enemies in the game. Indy starts with a whip and can find such weapons as throwing knives, grenades, pistols, rifles, and others. He can also collect hat powerups which allow him to sustain more damage.</desc>

		<name>Zanac</name>
		<desc>ZANAC A.I. is a 2D shoot them up game. You are flying fighter model ZANAC, a ship built by 256 Riot Fleet as man's last hope against total annihilation. On board are special weapons to help you blast your way through twelve screens of enemy creatures and destroy the system's home base. Zanac is divided into 12 "areas", which look like planets. The various locations range from deserts to jungles and from oceans to industrial zones, featuring many different types of enemies.

Zanac's unique artificial intelligence program can intensify the action based upon your level of skill. The better you are, the more powerful "The System". Examples of the A.I. (but not limited to) in this game: the enemies are generally coming randomly with their behavior based on factors like the position your ship in the screen, the place you last died; the shoot speed of the enemies and bosses do also vary.

At the end of each area (level) you'll have to fight the area boss. Area bosses are mainly based around huge, screen-filling bunker bases consisting of gun turrets and a "core". You have limited time for fighting against the area boss - a time out could mean failure in entering the next stage, and with the time running, more and more enemies were attacking as penalty.</desc>

		<name>Zen : Intergalactic Ninja</name>
		<desc>Zen: Intergalactic Ninja, based on a comic book of the same name, is a story about a militant environmentalist ninja named Zen. He has been assigned by a group a green, pointy-headed aliens to come to earth and stop environmental pollution by any means necessary. Eventually, he will have to find the big polluter, Lord Contaminous. The gameplay consists of side scrolling and isometric 3D scrolling action. Zen can run, jump, slice with this stick, or use powerups as the game requires.

One stage has Zen planting time bombs in a toxic factory and attempting to escape within 99 seconds. Standing in his way are roving lasers, security robots, and floating conveyor belts. The second stage takes place in an acid rain-drenched forest. Zen must revive the flowers in the forest with his photon stick while beating off acid rain-spewing floating mechanical devices.

The next stage takes place on an off shore oil rig that is going up in flames. Zen must grab fire extinguisher powerups and rescue trapped rig workers while dodging sentient oil slicks and raining fireballs. Another stage is called the High Speed Railway stage. The goal is to stop the garbagemen spreading nuclear waste. Zen is in a mining cart racing underground and fighting other enemies in carts. Zen can make this cart jump, which we will have to do often in order to survive the dangers of the mine.</desc>

		<name>Zombie Nation</name>
		<desc>In 1999 a mysterious object crashes into the desert and a mysterious creature, Darc Seed appears. Using magnetic powers, he soon turns the people of the United States into zombies and exerts influence over various weapons and objects. Among the weapons Darc Seed claims is the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi hears about this, he sets out for the United States to defeat Darc Seed and reclaim the sword.

What makes this so unusual however is that "great head of the samurai" is to be taken literally and Namakubi therefore is a giant disembodied head. His main weapon is the ability to shoot projectiles from his eyes and bombs from his mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks.

The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player can control Namakubi's movement across the screen and the ability to shoot. Enemies reduce health by varying amounts, health can be restored by increasing the player's score. The game features four distinct stages with 2 difficulty settings.</desc>

		<name>Zooming Secretary</name>
		<desc>Playing the role of a secretary in her trial period at a new job, you have to work your way through an increasingly difficult week without being fired for failing to answer calls on time. Each single screen level (wrapping on both horizontal and vertical axes) consists of an arrangement of platforms and staircases upon which are placed a number of phones and filing cabinets. When a phone rings, the topic that the call is about is represented by a symbol above the handset - and your task is to run to the matching filing cabinet then answer the call before the phone rings off. It starts of simple enough, with day one based on a symmetrical level with only two phones and two cabinets, but the difficulty soon ramps up with devious platform placement and a variety of obstructive NPC's thrown into the mix. The boss slows you down with his unhelpful remarks (just like in real life) and chatting with the office gossip-girl can leave you confused and swap over the topic currently held in your single-track mind. Then there's the delivery guy knocking people over and the oh-so-essential and distracting office romance - although thankfully there is also a coffee machine to provide you with a caffeine-fuelled speed boost to help you overcome all these obstacles. It's a simple yet compulsive concept that would work equally well as a browser-based casual game or modern console indie title, so to see Zooming Secretary make it's debut on the original 'family computer' is particularly exciting.</desc>

Amazingly, the next day, Mario, Luigi, Toad, and the Princess stumble upon a cave, which leads to the world that was in Mario's dream.

Subcon, the land of dreams, is under an evil spell thanks to Wart, so Mario and the gang must save the day. New creatures to defeat and plenty of nasty surprises await.

Choose from the four characters, each differing in speed and jumping ability, and head on through 7 levels each filled with puzzles, bosses, bonus money, the always helpful mushroom, and invincible star, plus bombs and magic potions. 
After each level, depending on the coins you collect, you can use them in the bonus game to collect extra lives.</desc>

		<desc>Bowser is back, and along with the Bowser kids, he's out to spoil Mario's day once again. 

This time, along with nabbing the Princess, the Bowser crew have also taken the magic wands from the Kings of each land and turned them into creatures.
It's up to Mario and Luigi to get back the magic wands, defeat Bowser, and save the Princess all before the day is done.

Old and new power-ups abound in each level for the Mario Brothers, including the return of the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, plus the new power-ups including the frog suit, the warp flute, and the most important of all, the leaf, which allows the player to fly and attack enemies with your tail.</desc>
