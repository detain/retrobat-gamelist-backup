1942 (c) 1984 Capcom.

1942 is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Pacific theatre during World War II, in which the goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet. 

The player pilots a plane dubbed the 'Super Ace' and has to shoot down waves of enemy planes while avoiding incoming enemy fire. The 'Super Ace' can perform a limited number of rolls or 'loop-the-loops' to evade enemy planes and shots. Just two lives are given to the player.

During the game, waves of red enemy planes periodically appear. If the player manages to destroy a red wave, a power-up, in the form of a 'POW' symbol, will be dropped and can be picked up. The power-up will award either increased fire-power (doubling the player's guns from two to four), a smart bomb that destroys all on-screen enemy planes the instant it's collected, two wingmen planes that flank the Super Ace and increase fire power, or simply extra points.

At the end of each stage the 'Super Ace' lands on an aircraft carrier and bonus points are awarded based on player performance. 1942 differs from other games in that its levels are numbered in reverse order, so the game begins at stage 32 and ends at stage 1.

- TRIVIA -

1942 was released in December 1984 in Japan. 1942 wasn't a Yoshiki Okamoto title, but designed by his former-classmate who joined Capcom a few years afterwards.

The plane is a lockheed P-38 Lightning, the same type which was flown by Richard Bong in the Second World War. He was America's top ace, credited with shooting down 40 Japanese planes.

It was the first Capcom title to spawn a successful series of sequels, with six titles in the 19XX line released from 1984 to 2000.

Stage names:
Stages 32–29: Midway

In the default high-score table, some previous Capcom Games appear. Since the Demo Mode only shows the top five, you need to play the game and to make a score of approximately 10,000 points (To enter in the top ten).
The number 5 (20,000 points) appears as 'EXEDEXES'.
Number 6 is 'VULGUS' (9,999 points).
Number 7 is 'SONSON' (8,888 points).
Number 8 is 'HIGEMARU' (7,777 points).
Number 9 is again 'EXEDEXES' (6,666 points).

The game ROM contains an unused Bomb sprite and an unused Star bonus items sprite.

Martin Bedard of Saint-Lazare, Quebec, Canada holds the record for this game with 13,360,960 points on November 19, 2006.

- UPDATES -

In the two oldest versions of the game, there's a bug in the scoring system for earning bonus lives. This bug was fixed in Revision B.

- SCORING -

Small planes are 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, or 200 points each.

The small red planes that fly formations of five or ten are 100 points each. Shooting all the planes in the five-plane formation awards 500 bonus points. Shooting all the planes in the ten-plane formation awards 1,000 bonus points. In both cases, when the last plane of a formation is destroyed, a power-up marker appears and is worth 1,000 points when picked up.

Occasionally a small airplane comes slowly out of the lower left or lower right hand side of the screen and flies towards the top. When hit, it turns into a special figure which awards 5,000 points when picked up.

Medium size planes are 1,000 or 1,500 points each.

Large bomber planes start at 2,000 points each. The score for each consecutive bomber destroyed without the player dying is 500 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 9,000 points. When the player’s ship is destroyed, the score for the bombers is reset back to 2,000 points.

There are four boss planes. They appear at the end of stages 26, 18, 10, and 02:
The stage 26 boss plane is worth 20,000 points.
The stage 18 boss plane is worth 30,000 points.
The stage 10 boss plane is worth 40,000 points.
The stage 02 boss plane is worth 50,000 points.

For all enemy planes that require more than one hit to kill, each hit on them gives 100 points.

At the end of each stage a bonus is awarded for shooting down percentage and for unused loops:
100% = Special bonus 50,000 points (in older revisions, the game displays 10,000 points bonus but 50,000 points are actually awarded).
95-99% = 20,000 points
90-94% = 10,000 points
85-89% = 5,000 points
80-84% = 4,000 points
70-79% = 3,000 points
60-69% = 2,000 points
50-59% = 1,000 points
Under 50% = 0 points
Unused loops are 1,000 points each.

Finishing the final stage awards 10,000,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* On Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04, a V-formation of red planes will come straight down from the top. If all five of the planes are destroyed, a Black/Red POW appears, giving the player an extra airplane when picked up.

* On stages with the wingman power-ups, use them to kill off the large bombers easily by crashing a wingman into them. You will get a second chance to get them back later on.

* On the stages with the boss planes, save all your loops; shoot at it quickly, loop down to avoid the shots, shoot at it again and THEN loop. You should be able to kill it this way.

* Most of the time it is easier to keep only one wingman rather than both; that way it's easier to maneuver around enemies. If you miss the red airplanes that give you the wingman powerup, kill off your plane (assuming you have some remaining) and the game will place you back before them.

* An interesting bug: If you win an extra plane from points when killing a boss plane, no extra planes will be awarded on the basis of points. Extra planes can still be obtained by getting the Black/Red POW, but no point-based bonuses will be awarded for the rest of the game.

* The end of stage bonus for 100% shooting down is actually 50,000 points, even though the game displays a 'special' bonus of only 10,000 points.

When the player loses all of his ships, the game offers to continue for another credit. If this option is chosen, the game continues where it left off but the score is reset to zero.

* There are six kinds of powerups: Quad fire, destroy all enemies on screen, two wingmen, make enemies stop shooting temporarily, extra loop, and extra life. Note that the destroy all enemies powerup does not destroy the small slow plane that has the 5,000 bonus item pickup.

Quad fire power-ups are found on Stages 32, 28, 24, 20, 16, 12, 08, and 04.
Destroy all enemies power-ups are found on Stages 31, 21, 19, 18, 11, 07, 03, and 01.
Wingman power-ups are found on Stages 30, 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 06, and 02.
Extra life power-ups are found on Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04.
Stop shooting power-ups are found on Stages 27 and 15. 
Extra loop power-ups are found on Stages 23, 18, 17, 13, 09, and 05.

* % and point up Stages are 29, 25, 21, 17, 13, 09, 05, 01. During these stages none of the enemies fire on the player except the large bomber planes.

* If the player earns enough bonus planes so that ten ships or more are in the reserve, the ten remaining ships indicators are replaced by the Greek letter Sigma (?).

2020 Super Baseball (c) 1991 SNK Corporation.

There is no longer conventional baseball in 2020. The Super Baseball designed by the SUPER BASEBALL ASSOCIATION has been very popular and is the best sport. However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball.

Finally, a fair game in going to be played at "CYBER EGG"!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* How to Play:
Hitting: 
[A] Swing/Return to base
[B] Stolen Base/Lead off
[C] Bunt
[D] Time Out

Fielding: 
[A] Pitch/Throw ball/Jump
[B] Base touch/Feint ball
[C] x
[D] Time out

* There is no infield fly rule in this game, which can be used to the advantage of a defender if there are base runners. Double plays and even triple plays are common because of this.

* A base runner cannot begin to steal bases until the pitcher has released the ball. In most baseball video games and in real life, a runner can begin to steal the next base at any time. However, stealing a base beforehand can only be done if you continuously press the steal button right after the screen cuts-back after the batter hit a foul ball, and the pitcher will not even notice you running.

* The 3rd baseman, 2nd baseman, and 1st baseman will not leave the base to retrieve a ball. They will instead stand on the base and wait for another fielder to get the ball, which can sometimes mean they will stand there while the ball rolls inches away from them. The only exception would be if the shortstop covers third or second base for the fielder; then they remain in the stationary position.

* Since the game has semi-automatic fielding, you cannot change which defensive player you want to run after the ball, which means sometimes the pitcher will end up chasing a ball well into the outfield.

* If a ball is hit far enough into the stands, it can sometimes become stuck, allowing the batter to garnish an in the park home run. Because of the reduced home run zone, faster players can often round the bases by hitting the ball up into the fair-zone stands.

* The computer players will always attempt to hit the ball straight, as if trying to hit a home run, no matter what the strength of the batter. This can sometimes give an unfair advantage to you, since they do not try to pull the ball just barely fair in order to get a hit. This has its downfall, in that some powerful players will hit home runs easily.

* You cannot play against a team from the other league.

* If you manage to score more than 100 runs, your score will turn back to zero, as there are only two spaces for your runs. Consequently, if you score 101 runs, and your opponent scores two runs, you will lose the game 01-02.

* You cannot change players positions in the field or line up without replacing them.

* If another player is in your line of path to throw the ball, they will catch the ball after you throw it. This means that if the shortstop retrieves a ground ball just behind 3rd base, then the throw will get cut-off by the 3rd baseman and then the pitcher before the ball gets to 1st base. The pitcher will almost always get in the way, and this can present a problem when trying to pull a double play between third and first or second and home.

龍虎の拳 (c) 1992 SNK Corp.
(Ryuuko no Ken)

An early Neo-Geo martial arts fighting game with 2 selectable characters in 1-player mode and 8 selectable characters in 2-player mode which also features a long-nosed end boss. Progressive damage is shown on each fighter's face for a dramatic effect.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-044

- TRIVIA -

Ryuuko no Ken was released in September 1992 in Japan.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Dragon and Tiger Fist'.

This game is known outside Japan as Art of fighting" 

A bootleg of this game is known as "Fit of Fighting".

SNK's second fighting-game franchise. It was the first fighting game by SNK to feature the character designs of former SNK illustrator Shinkiro, who would go on to do the character designs for the later "Fatal Fury" and "The King of Fighters" games.

This is the first fighting game to feature the 'camera zoom' - where the camera zooms in when the fighters are close together and zooms out when the fighters move away from each other. This is also the first fighting game to utilize a 'spirit meter'. Every time a special move is executed the spirit meter is depleted accordingly. The more powerful the special move, the more it depletes. When it's empty special moves can't be done anymore, however, you can recharge the spirit meter by standing still and holding the A or B button leaving you totally defenseless.

Robert Garcia design was inspired by the famous actor Steven Seagal.
Takuma Sakazaki desgin was inspired by Masutatsu Oyama.

The Haou Shokou Ken was referred to as the Haou Ken (or as the game put it, the 'Haow-Ken'). Its similarity to Ryu's (of "Street Fighter" fame) Hadou Ken forced the name change.

The character's fighting stance and their victory pose depends on how beaten up they are.

Lee Pai Long is called Lee Piron in the game's source code.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Todoh, Jack, Lee, King, Micky and John: player 2 must join.

* Play as Mr. Big and Mr. Karate: reach them on 1P Game, then player 2 must join.

* Move Command Delay: its possible to input the commands for any special or super move but it is not necessary to press the corresponding attack button right away, this allows you to delay any move for as long as you want in order to surprise an opponent! This trick also enables you to perform slower versions of some special moves such as projectile attacks. Try it!:)

- TRIVIA -

Ryuuko no Ken 2 was released in March 1994 in Japan.

This game is known outide Japan as Art of Fighting 2.

Geese Howard's guest appearance (see 'Tips And Tricks' section) tries to tie this game's story with the Fatal Fury games. Apparently, this game takes place a few years before the events occurred in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" since Geese looks quite young and uses a very different fighting style (instead of his trademark Aikido which he learned in Japan). Another fact is the special ending when you defeat Geese (you get to see when he gives the order to eliminate Jeff Bogard who happens to be Terry &amp; Andy Bogard's father, before he heads to Japan to learn that country's martial art techniques). This fact also explains why Ryo Sakazaki is so damn powerful in his "Fatal Fury Special" appearance (after all, he was already a powerful &amp; skilled fighter and has had more time than most of the Fatal Fury characters to brush up on his techniques!). Obviously, all these storyline details were ignored in the King of Fighters series for the sake of convenience (All the "Art of Fighting" characters should be way older than the Fatal Fury characters in that game!).

In Temjin's ending, Terry Bogard makes a guest appearance as a little boy!

- UPDATES -

The Japanese version features different voice actors for some characters (John Crawley, Robert Garcia &amp; King).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Adjust the game difficulty setting up to level 8 in order to boost game's overall speed!

It may be downright cheap &amp; silly, but if you successfully manage to throw an opponent and then hit him with a special move as he gets up, you will dizzy your opponent! This can be done over and over again with most characters...:/

Beat opponents with a special move at the end of the decisive round to see a special 'defeat' animation (some auto-combos &amp; special moves that lift the opponent of the ground won't work though).

Defeat all opponents in two rounds only to fight a special battle against Fatal Fury's main villain &amp; owner of Southtown: Geese Howard (Notice that it is possible to use continues &amp; use different characters as long as you defeat your opponents in 'two rounds only'!).:)

Asteroids (c) 1979 Atari, Incorporated.

Asteroids is a legendary, genre defining game - in an era replete with genre-defining classics - in which a single player takes control of a spaceship trapped in the middle of an asteroid belt. A number of large, slow-moving asteroids drift randomly around the play area and must be shot by the player. When shot, the asteroids will break into a number of smaller pieces which must also be shot until eventually, all of the asteroids and fragments will be destroyed and the next wave begins. 

Asteroids introduced real-world physics to video games for the first time, with speed and inertia all adding to the player's problems. As well as the inertia of the player's ship - forcing the player to allow for the ship slowing down and speeding up whenever the Thrust button was utilized - shot asteroids would often send fragments flying in seemingly random directions, and at varying and unpredictable speeds. 

As well as the ever-present asteroids, flying saucers also make a regular appearance. These move horizontally and diagonally around the screen, firing at the player's ship, and must be quickly destroyed. They are destroyed when hit by the player's shot, when hit by a saucer's shot or when they collide with an asteroid. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Spaceship - This is you, the player. You can rotate 360 degrees, fire bullets, thrust forward in any direction, and hyperspace to safety if you feel you are in danger. 

Large Asteroid - These are the large rocks that fill the screen at the beginning of each stage. Hitting one with a bullet will break it apart into two Medium Asteroids. 

Medium Asteroid - Slightly smaller than Large Asteroids, but faster moving. Shooting one of these will result in two Small Asteroids. 

Small Asteroid - These are the smallest and fastest rocks on the screen. If a bullet hits one of these, it will vaporize. 

Large Saucer - Large flying saucers appear on the screen from time to time, randomly firing shots around the screen. They pose a minor threat. 

Small Saucer - The smaller flying saucers are deadlier than the large variety. They are much more precise with their shots, and are more likely to kill you. Eliminate them quickly or get out of their range.

The Asteroids upright cabinet was identical in construction to the "Lunar Lander" cabinet. It was a black upright with sideart that featured a scene of a starship in a blue field of asteroids (with several red explosions thrown in for good measure). The marquee featured almost identical graphics to the side-art (with the addition of the familiar yellow 'Asteroids' logo). The control panel was a busy looking red, white, and blue affair that had no joysticks (only buttons). While the monitor bezel had kind of a nebula scene printed on it (this did not really seem to match the rest of the machine). 

Two different sets of coin doors were made on this title, with early cabinets having a unique design that was soon abandoned in favor of the same one that Atari had been using on Lunar Lander.

- TRIVIA -

Asteroids was released on November 17, 1979 in the USA.

Asteroids was a much celebrated arcade game that captured the imaginations of millions of players, while capturing a good many quarters as well. 

Originally called 'Cosmos', Asteroids' original design brief was a simple copy of Cinematronics' "Space Wars"; with asteroids littering the play-field purely for visual effect. 'Cosmos' was also once known as 'Planet Grab', in which the player had to claim a planet by touching it with their spaceship. 'Cosmos' allowed players to blow up the planets and duel with another ship, Space Wars-style. Only in Asteroids, which arrived two years later, did Atari engineer Lyle Rains, introduce the concept of free-floating rocks. 

On June 17, 1980, Atari's Asteroids and Lunar Lander were the first two video games to ever be registered in the Copyright Office. 

The first 200 Asteroids machines were actually Lunar Lander cabinets; Asteroids was so successful that Atari cut Lunar Lander's production run and released the 200 aforementioned machines, complete with their original Lunar Lander cabinet art. 

Asteroids remains Atari's bestselling arcade game of all time, with approximately 56,565 units produced (47,840 upright and 8,725 cocktail) in total. 

* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters: Working on Asteroids was so intense that Lyle Rains and Ed Logg often dreamt about their work. 

Lyle Rains: 'In the course of my work I have always found that there are times during the development process when the project gets to me in such a way that I'm eating, drinking, sleeping, and breathing the project. When I close my eyes the images of the screen are there and I dream about them at night. There is something just very intense when you live with a project like that day and night, for months at a time. When we were working on Asteroids, I would play Asteroids for a number of hours in the evening, then I'd go home and I'd close my eyes, and as I was drifting off to sleep I'd see the asteroids floating around the screen.'. 

Ed Logg: 'I was shooting the asteroids all night long; I'd just play the game over and over and over in my head, just as if you were playing it in real life. To a certain extent, I play a lot of the games in my mind long before I ever write them because you have to get all the interactions down pat before you can start programming. I know what it's going to look like before I even get there.'. 

* Popular from the Start: a good barometer of a game's future success was how popular it was within the labs at Atari. The software developers often had to chase people away from their Prototype machines when they arrived at their desks in the morning or returned from lunch. 

Lyle Rains: 'The development on the really good games gets bogged down, because people want to play them all the time. I was in the lab quite often playing Asteroids, as were many other people.'. 

On the overall popularity of Asteroids, Steve Calfee said: 'A lot of people really liked it. Somehow, there's something about people, they like to clean spaces. With Asteroids it's easy to measure your accomplishment, you're breaking big rocks into little rocks and then the little rocks into nothing. It's sort of a metaphor for life.'. 

Rich Adam recalled his own first encounter with Asteroids: 'I'll never forget going into the lab and seeing that game for the first time. It was like an adrenaline rush. I'm out flying this spaceship and it's the miraculous escape. I've got this situation where I've got tons of these boulders flying around the screen, I have almost nowhere to go. I get to blast my way out of it and cheat death one more time; that's a good fantasy, you've got all these things flying around and yet you're able to survive.' 

Howard Delman described what it was like creating the sounds for Asteroids: 'In those days there were no all-purpose sound chips like we have now, so I had to create a hardware circuit for each sound. I would string together electrical circuits that would produce an output wave-form that corresponded to the wave-form of the sound. When put through an amplifier and a loud-speaker, it would sound like whatever I was trying to create. The boom-boom-boom background sound was sort of meant to be like a heartbeat, and the idea was that as the game progressed, the sound speeded up, and the player's heart would speed up, too. You know, stress!'. 

* The Great 25-Cent Escape: On the intensity of playing Asteroids, Ed Rotberg recalled: 'Asteroids was just so intense in the fact that you had a concept of all around fantasy. You had to keep your eyes constantly in motion around the screen because the danger could be coming from any direction, at anytime, and it was always so imminent. In Asteroids it was just you out there, trying to survive. It's an incredibly intense game. The tuning in terms of how fast the spaceship turns and how fast the bullets move and how far they go and how fast the asteroids can go, just all the tuning that Ed Logg put into that, is real artistry.'. 

Asteroids is considered, artistically, to be a video-game masterpiece. Ed Logg opines: 'The simple fact that the spaceship in Asteroids continues to move after you cut thrust, providing a wee glimpse of the Newtonian mechanics of actual space flight, triggered the imaginations of many users'. 

Rich Adam said: 'Asteroids fulfilled the fantasy of being out in space, with no gravity, and free floating. The spaceship had a very elegant grace. A lot of motion in the game had grace, even the way the boulders floated around.'. 

And the game's epic quality was noted by Ed Rotberg: 'What Asteroids allows players to do is to put themselves in an incredible predicament, and then extricate themselves from it. You feel like a hero coming out of it.'. 

There was a modified version of Asteroids that was given the nick-name "Turtleroids"; this was part of a long series of practical jokes against the vice-president of marketing for Atari who was feeling jaded in his feeling towards a game concept called 'Turtle Races'. One day, Ed switched the PROMs of the golden edition of Asteroids in the lobby of Atari so that the little and big UFOs were replaced by turtles, thus providing them with a constant reminder. Another practical joke involving Asteroids was a slight modification in the prototype of the game, because Owen Rubin (initials ORR on most Atari high score tables) kept filling up the high score tables when the programmers were not around. So, they modified the program to replace Owen's initials with Ed's own to keep him away. 

In a monumental display of overconfidence on the part of the Atari programmers, Asteroids rolls over at only 99,999 points. Several players during days-long marathon games have scored over 100,000,000... 

Asteroids keeps track of up to 255 extra men. If the player has too many, the game may slow down, probably due to the processor having to draw all the extra men on the screen. 

John McAllister holds the official record for this game with 41,838,740 points on April 5, 2010. 

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including ASTEROID. 

Asteroids inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Hyperspace' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. 

An Asteroids unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Terms of Endearment', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet', in the 1984 movie 'The Iceman', in the 1985 movie 'Remo Williams - The Adventure Begins', in the 1985 movie 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure', and in the 1983 movie 'The Adventures of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie - Strange Brew'.

An upright Asteroids unit appears in the 38 Special music video 'Caught Up In You'.

- UPDATES -

Revision 1 has an invulnerability glitch, which allows players to hide the ship in the upper corners of the screen (in the score) and be invulnerable to collisions. 

Revision 1 also has a bug which affects thrusting. If the ship reaches full velocity moving down or left, and continues thrusting while rotating to the opposite direction, the ship will not slow down from the full velocity that has been reached in the original direction. 

Revision 2 says '1979 Atari' at the bottom of the title screen, instead of the 'Asteroids by Atari' that was displayed in Revision 1. Also, the invulnerability glitch of Revision 1 is corrected. 

Revision 4: 
1) allows small saucer to use wrap-around feature, 
2) allows small saucer to fire immediately when entering the playing area, and 
3) prevents the intermittent loss of 3rd initial on 10th highest score.

- SCORING -

Large Asteroids: 20 points. 
Medium Asteroids: 50 points. 
Small Asteroids: 100 points. 
Large Flying Saucer: 200 points. 
Small Flying Saucer: 1,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When you start the game, your spaceship will be in the middle of the screen with four large asteroids heading toward your ship. After all the rocks are destroyed, the next round begins. The number of initial large asteroids depends on the round number: 
Round 1: 4 
Round 2: 6 
Round 3: 8 
Round 4: 10 
Round 5 and up: 11 

Your job is to blast those rocks. However, when you blast them, they break up into two medium rocks. Blasting a medium rock gives you two small rocks. Note: There is an exception to this rule. The game program only allows 26 asteroids on the screen at any one time. If the screen already contains 26 asteroids of any size, then when you shoot a large asteroid it breaks up into only one medium asteroid, and when you shoot a medium asteroid it breaks up into only one small asteroid. You can completely destroy a large asteroid with only three shots instead of seven when the screen is filled up like this. 

Destroy the fastest-moving asteroids first. The slower asteroids are easier to avoid and you can deal with them later.

In addition, you have to contend with large and small flying saucers. Remember that you get most of your points by shooting these. On the first few screens, you can sit in the middle and blast rocks to your hearts content. There isn't that much danger since the large saucer doesn't track and only fires random shots. Keep in mind of a few things when shooting: 
1) You can have four shots on the screen at any one time. This is useful for when you are blasting rocks at close range. You can pretty much drill them to dust. 
2) Your shots 'wrap around' the screen. This means any shot that goes past the edge of the screen will reappear on the opposite side traveling the same direction. The saucers also have 'wrap around' shots. 

* Try to keep a few defensive shots in reserve. Sometimes, it isn't wise to fire all four shots at once. Without a shot or two in reserve, you are vulnerable if you need to protect yourself from an unexpected asteroid or flying saucer.

* After 10,000 points, the small saucer becomes a permanent part of the game. You can no longer sit in one place since the small saucer is able to track your ship and take you out with the first or second shot. 

* Use hyperspace only in very desperate situations. Something like having four asteroids coming at you at once with nowhere to escape would be a good reason. Eight times out of ten, hyperspace will either put your ship in danger (from a saucer, a plummeting asteroid, or saucer fire) or when you appear somewhere else, your ship will blow up. 

* Although there is danger from the rocks and saucers, you can also be a danger to yourself. Use the thrust carefully or you will find yourself careening out of control on the screen. Some players get really good, however, moving around and shooting. 

* For those desired high scores, you can use the hunting trick. It goes something like this: 
1) After 10,000 points, the small saucers appear. They are worth 1,000 points apiece. First, blast every rock until you have one small rock left. 
2) Go sit in the upper left or right corner of the game screen. 
3) If the small saucer appears from the side you are on, you can blast it before it gets off a shot. If it appears on the opposite side, use the shot 'wrap around' to take care of it. Some people have done this for hours on end and racked up scores in the millions. Of course, it takes a long time at 1,000 points a pop. 
4) Also keep in mind that the small saucer can wrap shots so you may have to move out of danger.

Blazing Star (c) 1998 Yumekobo.

Blazing Star is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the planets of Remuria and Mutras are engaged in endless interplanetary war. This fuels the development of ever-more dangerous weapons, eventually leading to the production of fully organic weapons that combine both human and alien technology. Soon, a fully sentient weapon called 'Brawshella' is born. Brawshella gathers all animal life on Remuria and Mutras and bends them to its will, forcing them to attack and assimilate the human race. 

Within days of Brawshella's appearance all humans are assimilated and now have no other purpose than to continue fighting each other. Over time, six of the assimilated fighter pilots regain their consciousness and remember their pasts. Upon rediscovering their humanity, they turn against the machines, in a battle to save humanity.

Blazing Star is controlled via joystick and two buttons. Button 'A' fires the normal shot, if this is tapped rapidly, however, a variation on the normal shot is used. If the A button is held down, the ship stores energy for a charged shot, which is fired when the button is released. The charged-shot attacks have a duration based on how long the button is held for. Pressing the B button during the attack will split the projectile, greatly increasing its range.

Players can choose to pilot one of six different ships, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The 'Hellhound' is the perfect ship for performing high-scoring combos, for example. The 'Windina' has a wide and powerful shot; both 'Dinos' - the Pulstar hunters - are excellent in defense and pack efficient weapons. Finally, Aryutalism and Peplos require a little more skill and are best suited to experienced players. 

Power-ups can increase the strength of the player's guns, while also increasing the maximum power of the charged shot. The types of shots, charge-up attacks, and split shots used are dependent on which ship the player selects.

Export release. Game developed in Japan. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese release entry; "Black Dragon".

- TRIVIA -

Black Tiger was released in August 1987 outside Japan. It is known in Japan as "Black Dragon".

Although they are similar in nature, there are also significant differences between the export version, Black Tiger, and the original version, Black Dragon. Globally, the export version is an easier game. Below are some of the more apparent differences found in these Export versions: 
* Items less expensive.
* Less pitfalls (rocks).
* Less and easiest enemies.
* Bosses easiest.
* Points given by the Red Dragon, Red Demon Warrior, and Black Dragon are differents (see scoring section).
* The bonuses are changed (different value and position).
* The secret item locations are the same but the symbols for them are different.

A bootleg of this game was released by Dragon with the same name. 

Isiah Johnson holds the official record for this game with 2344150 points on May 31, 2008.

- SCORING -

Scoring is exactly the same as in the original Japanese version except for the following bosses:

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 32 years ago:

Blood Bros. (c) 1990 TAD.

Blood Bros is an into-the-screen shooter with the action viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The brothers can move left and right to avoid incoming fire while the enemies themselves are targeted by moving an on-screen cross-hair over them and pressing fire. If the fire button is held down, the player-character remains static, allowing for more accurate targeting of the cross-hair. While static, the brothers are more vulnerable to incoming enemy fire.

Players have limitless ammunition for their primary gun, and carry a limited number of sticks of dynamite. Dynamite is used in a similar fashion to grenades; it can be thrown at enemies and inflicts greater damage than guns. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed. Each of the game's stages is littered with structures that can also be destroyed. This removes enemy cover as well as earning players bonus points. 

Power-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed on-screen or dropped by shooting the special characters that occasionally appear, such as the small Indian Chief or warthogs. Points and weaponry can also be dispensed from the tin can, if you shoot it into the air and juggle it with subsequent shots. Some power-ups give special weapons with increased firepower, others grant extra dynamite or points.

- TRIVIA -

Even if titlescreen says 1990, Blood Bros. was released in January 1991 in Japan.

According to dead code buried in Sky Smasher, it appears that the working title for Blood Bros. was 'Cabal II In West'.

A pirate version of the game is known as "West Story".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Here's A Way To Play Blood Bros. For As Long As You Want:
1) Get to the second screen (preferably without dying on the first screen).
2) Shoot the building on the right side of the screen and start shooting the trees in the background on the right. 20,000 points fly out from each bunch of trees. Continue.
3) That is basically it. A few problems occur and here is how to counter them:
3a) 5 men run across the back from the left and throw grenades: Just shoot the grenades before they get to you. Eventually they come out less often, and will stop altogether.
3b) The men on the right come out from the edge to shoot you: Same as above. They stop eventually.
3c) A plane flies over and drops bombs: Same as above. It stops after some time.
3d) After a certain amount of time a bird comes out to kill you: Let it. Only 2 birds ever come out (sometimes only 1) and then they also stop coming. This is why it pays not to die on the first screen.
4) Hold your finger on the button to keep shooting the trees (sticky-tape works well here) and prepare to get 'really' bored. Play the neighboring game so that you can keep an eye on it.

* Extra Live: On the 1-1 and 4-1 stages, the tin can be shot eight times to give you a free man. If you miss it, don't bother trying again - you only get one chance.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 36 years ago:

Bubble Bobble (c) 1986 Taito Corp.

One or two players take on the role of Bub and Bob, two cute dinosaurs who must battle through 100 platform-packed single screen levels to rescue their girlfriends. Bub and Bob are armed only with the ability to blow bubbles, in which the game's many enemies can be trapped and killed. The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the dinosaurs reach previously inaccessible areas of a level. 

Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points. 

On many levels, bubbles containing fire, water or a lightning bolt appear. These can be burst by players to release their contents and destroy enemies. The fire bubble drops flames down onto the nearest platform, killing any enemies it hits. The lightning bubble sends a lightning bolt horizontally across the screen, its direction dictated by whichever side of the bubble the player hits to burst it. The water bubble releases a torrent of water that will quickly flow down the platforms to the bottom of the screen. Any enemies caught in the flow are killed. 

Bubbles containing letters also appear. The aim is to collect the letters needed to spell the word E.X.T.E.N.D. which earns players an extra life. 

The game's simple-yet-involving game-play saw Bubble Bobble become an instant classic. Its two-player co-operative mode, coupled with the incredible amount of hidden secrets and potential for strategic play - unheard of in the platform genre - would set the standard by which all other platform games were judged.

- TRIVIA -

Bubble Bobble was released in August 1986. 

This was one of the first games to feature multiple endings. 

The title of this game, Bubble Bobble, is a cross between the words 'bubble' and the name of the heroes: Bub and Bob. 

The enemies are named (Round number of initial appearance applies to 'Normal' mode. For information on 'Super' mode, please see the Romstar (US version) entry, Updates section: 
'Zen-Chan' [aka 'Bubble Buster', 'Benzo'] - First appears in Round 1 
'Mighta' [aka 'Stoner', 'Boris'] - First appears in Round 6 
'Monsta' [aka 'Beluga', 'Blubba'] - First appears in Round 10 
'PulPul' [aka 'Hullaballoon', 'Boaboa'] - First appears in Round 20 
'Banebou' [aka 'Coiley', 'Bonnie-bo'] - First appears in Round 30 
'Hidegonsu' [aka 'Incendo'] - First appears in round 40 
'Drunk' [aka 'Willy Whistle', 'Bonner'] - First appears in Round 50 
'Invader' [aka 'Super Socket'] - First appears in Round 60 
'Super Drunk' [aka 'Grumple Gromit'] - the boss character whom Bub and Bob fight in the final round 
'Skel-Monsta' [aka 'Baron Von Blubba'] - Appears when you take too much time in a round 
'Rascal' [aka 'Rubblen'] - Appears when you linger too long in a secret room 

The data code contains unused graphics of a full set of slot machine icons. These aren't used anywhere, there's no palette that fits them, and they wouldn't really fit anywhere either. 

In 1996, Taito announced that they lost the original source code program to Bubble Bobble following a reorganization - when it came to the recent ports and sequels, they had to work from program disassembly, playing the game and (mainly) the various home computer ports. 

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'H.!', but go to the Tips and Tricks section for more information about 'SEX':-) 

Olly Cotton holds the official record for this game with 6,060,730 points on February 23, 2011. 

Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Bobble Bobble" and "Super Bobble Bobble". 

Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Taito Game Music - 28XA-110) on January 25, 1987. 

NES cover band The Advantage cover two songs from Bubble Bobble on their self-titled debut album released on April 6, 2004.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Bubble Bobble is a game heavily relying on game-play and precise technique rather than graphics, and it features a series of special techniques and tricks a player can perform to maximize his or her score, make some rounds of the game easier or faster to finish or just to be able to survive or even finish a round. Some of these techniques have special nicknames, which may differ from player to player and from country to country. 

'Kissing monsters' or just kissing means killing a monster by blowing a bubble at almost contact distance: the monster will be instantly bubbled and the bubble will be instantly popped, giving the visual effect of the player killing a monster with a 'kiss'. Some players flip their joysticks in the opposite direction after pressing the bubble buttons, giving more chances of an 'instant pop' and changing flight direction for the dead monster. This technique is useful in stages where monsters move too fast, bubbles last for too short of a time or it's otherwise hard to bubble them normally. Of course good timing is required for this technique to work. 

'Riding bubbles' means keeping the jump button pressed when dropping on a bubble: if done correctly, instead of popping the bubble, your dragon will instead jump on it, possibly continuously, enabling him to 'ride' bubbles in order to reach otherwise unreachable areas. Some stages can't be finished without this technique. 

'Climbing' is a step up from riding bubbles. It means standing at half a bubble distance from a wall, jumping and blowing a bubble almost simultaneously, jumping up from that bubble and blowing another bubble and so on. This is necessary if the air current pushes down bubbles but you need to climb up. Having the rapid-bubbling power-up (the yellow candy) makes climbing a lot easier, especially if you got the running shoes already. 

'Bubbling oneself through' means 'riding a bubble' through the opening at the top of a stage or even just through the ceiling of a stage in order to appear at the lower part, like some flying monsters can do. This technique is required to finish some stages or to get unstuck from some places, or just to save time. 

'Blowing against the wall' means blowing bubbles against wall at contact distance: the bubbles will pop immediately thus giving the player 10 points per bubble pop. This can be used to either increase a player's score, or to set a player's score to a specific amount, in order to do other tricks. 

'Two equal digits' means using the 'blowing against the wall' technique or other score-adjusting techniques in order to make the two penultimate (100s and 10s places) digits of at least one player equal, e.g., 456770, before the last enemy bubble is burst. If done correctly and the score is not modified when this occurs, then all remaining non-special bubbles on screen will be turned to 700-point bonuses, whose appearance depends on the digit picked. E.g., 7 gives Chocolate Ice Creams, 3 gives Hamburgers, and so on. 
Note: This trick is easier to do with two players (one player adjusts his score and the other bursts the bubbles), but it can also be done with only one player, although calculating exactly how much (and if) one's score will be modified when bursting the last enemy bubbles can be extremely complex, if not unpredictable, especially if there are very large and clustered bubble bunches. 
Note: Rounds with numbers ending with 5 and 0 up to and including level 50 generate bonuses from bubbles automatically, though, and some rounds (including round 1) do it by default. 

Internal Counters: An interesting (and exploitable) part of bubble bobble is that powerups are not entirely random. As with the two-digit trick, many internal counters in this game decide which special powers are available for collection. For example, rapid bubble shooting (a sweet in yellow wrapping), fast moving bubbles (a blue sweet), or fast moving bubbles (a blue sweet) appear shortly after either Bub or Bob jumps 51 times, pops 51 bubbles, or blows 51 bubbles. Also, running around a lot causes the speed powerup (red shoe) to appear. Keeping this is mind, it is possible to gain all power-ups with relative ease. Although there are many more counters that control various aspects of the game, one of particular interest is the letters forming the word EXTEND. Getting all 7 letters will end the current level and award the player with an extra life 'NICE 1P!' - these letters have a greater chance of appearing when more enemies are defeated simultaneously. Also, gathering three of the same letter causes candy canes to appear which in turn lead to a special big item at the end of the level! 

* Unlimited Run And Rapid Fire: At the main title screen, press Left, Jump, Left, 1P, Left, Fire, Left, 1P. If this is done correctly there will be a message in the bottom left corner of the title screen a red POWER UP!. 

* Original Bubble Bobble: At the title screen, press Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Right, 1P. It will say at the bottom of screen ORIGINAL GAME. The game will give the PORTALS in some screens, if you can get in them you will get LOADS of diamonds. 

* The 'Super Bubble Bobble' Code: this will change the Bubble Bobble logo in 'Super Bubble Bobble' and the game will change under several points of view: different platform colors, different order for monster appearances... The code that must be entered at the title screen to access Super Bubble Bobble is displayed at the end of the credits after you beat the game in 2 players, normal mode. The message is coded, but it hints you to enter the secret room in level 20 to get the key for decoding. If you do so, you enter the secret room, on the base of which there is an inscription. The first line is the coding of the alphabet, the other lines are coded advices to beat the final boss. The decoded 'secret message' is: SJBLRJSR (Start - Jump - Bubble - Left - Right - Jump - Start - Right) 

The decoded advices in the secret rooms are: 
Room in level 20: IF YOU WANT TO BECOME THE OLD FIGURE, USE THE POWER OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP, AND FIGHT WITH ME! (hint to play in two player mode to defeat the final boss and see the real ending) 
Room in level 30: I ENCLOSE THESE MAGICAL MEDICINE HERE, BECAUSE THOSE ARE MY WORST FEARS... (hint to use the lighting bubble to beat the boss) 
Room in level 40: IF YOU WANT TO GET BACK YOUR LOVE OF TRUTH, YOU MUST HELP EACH OTHER UNTIL THE LAST... (hint to end the game in two player mode to see the real endings) 

A little more trivia on Super Bubble Bobble: If you beat the game in Super mode, two players, you will discover that the final boss is your mother and father that were controlled by some unknown evil. By defeating the boss you free them and your girlfriends, and are reverted back to your original human form (the one you play "Rainbow Island" with). 

* Secret Tombs: Make it to level 20 without dying and a door appears -- it leads to a 'secret tomb', a level full of diamonds. There are secret tombs at levels 20 and 30, also. Make it to level 50 without dying and a strange, bee-hive-shaped door appears; enter it and you warp to level 70. DON'T kill the Drunks on level 50, or the door disappears; bubble them and wait! Btw, with two players, only one of the players must survive unharmed to get the secret door. 

* Paffing A Skel: Skel, also known as 'Baron Von Blubba', is that nasty white monster that comes after you when you've taken too long; with two players, two Skels will appear. If one player is killed by HIS Skel, then he can collide with his partner's Skel 'WHILE HE IS STILL FLICKERING'. If the player's icon is still flickering, the other player's Skel will disappear (poof!), with no harm to the once-slain character. 

* Full Ending Sequence: Beat the game with two players in Super mode and you'll get the full end sequence. 

* High Score Codes: after getting a high score, enter your initials as: 
'SEX' - Pitch fork-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds. 
'TAK' - Octopus-turns bubbles into X's at end of level. 
'STR' - Flamingo-turns bubbles into smiling turds at end of level. 
'KTT' - Beer-turns bubbles into pizzas at end of level, what a perfect match !!! 
'...' - Knife-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds. 
'I.F', 'MTJ', 'NSO', 'KIM', 'YSH' - Coke can-flying sunflowers across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 34 years ago:

Cabal (c) 1988 TAD Corporation.

Cabal is a war themed shoot-em-up with one or simultaneous two-player gameplay in which two unnamed commandos must battle through five different stages - each containing four screens of play - to reach and defeat an evil dictator.

The game is an into-the-screen shooter with the action viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The commandos can move left and right to avoid incoming fire while the enemies themselves are targeted by moving an on-screen cross-hair over them and pressing fire. If the fire button is held down, the commando remains static, allowing for more accurate targeting of the cross-hair. While static, the commandos are vulnerable to incoming enemy fire.

Initially, the commandos are armed with only a standard single-shot gun (albeit with unlimited-ammunition) and a limited number of grenades, but additional grenades and weapon power-ups can be earned as play progresses.

As well as enemy troops, vehicles such as tanks, armoured cars and helicopters also appear and take numerous shots to destroy. When destroyed or killed, some on-screen targets release points bonuses and weapon power-ups that drop to the bottom of the screen and can be picked up by the commandos. Weapon power-ups include additional grenades, a rapid-fire machine and an automatic shotgun, which has a slightly lower firing rate but has a larger targeting cross-hair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot.

Each of the game's screens is littered with buildings and barricades that can also be destroyed. This removes enemy cover as well as earning players bonus points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The game have a 'anti-leeching' tool. If you delay a lot of minutes (between 4 and 5 minutes) on the same stage/screen, you will receive a hard 'rain of bombs', like that bombs the airplanes shoot on you. Try to do it on the stage 1-1, the easiest. And if you delay a lot of time in the same position of the 'enemy' bar, without progress, you will receive this rain of bombs easily. Yeah, if you are expert, you will can survive to these bombs, without die, using your skill on the 'rolling' move. You will receive a lot of items (bombs, weapons) if you destroy bombs or if you shoot at the bush.

* General Tips:
1) Killing people and motorcycles (and rocks) won't get you many points -- don't bother unless they get in your way.
2) A well-placed grenade will destroy two choppers.
3) If you are in a corner and a chopper is firing at you, run farther into the corner. Even if you're already IN the corner, if it sees you trying to move toward the corner, you won't die.
4) If you find yourself trapped by incoming bullets, spin the trackball down and to one side (but mostly down). This will cause your character to 'duck and roll'. If you are rolling, you can't be hit.
5) Kill the snipers (the guys in gray bullet-proof suits). Half the time you'll get a grenade for killing him. If you don't, two medics will come running out to reclaim the body. Shoot these medics as much as possible! Each shot they will drop 1 grenade. But the limit is 4 grenades on the screen at the same time. Pick up these grenades as quickly as possible and shoot the medics again for more grenades. Sometimes they will drop new weapons too.
6) On the level one screen with the sliding doors: shoot out the doors immediately upon starting the level. This will stop the guys from lobbing grenades at you.
7) Airplanes are hard to kill. The best method is by using machine gun or bazooka gun on it. In the absence of a super-gun, you can lead a grenade ABOVE where it is on the screen. If you don't get it, and the three bombs are being dropped right on you, it IS possible to stand BETWEEN where two bombs are coming down. You WON'T die!
8) When there's nothing good to shoot on the screen, fire at a bush. This is the way to get extra gunnery! Sometimes you'll only get more grenades, but you'll eventually get a super-gun!

* Tips For Specific Enemies:
1) The giant chopper that shows up at the end of screen 4 on level one doesn't give you any points until you destroy it. Shooting the orange bullets won't knock off any points toward killing the chopper. Only shoot the orange bullets if they're in your way. Otherwise, spend all your time shooting the chopper. Don't waste any grenades on the chopper--it doesn't do as much damage as your gun (and you have unlimited bullets).
2) The semi-truck that shows up at the end of screen 4 on level three will self-destruct if you destroy the CAB (the blue section in the front of it). On this screen you actually get the point for it as well. It is easiest to kill it with the machine gun and/or bazooka gun, but in the absence of either of these, throw grenades at the cab (leading the throw by about four inches). It is MUCH easier to destroy the cab rather than destroying all the attack sections that it drops off.
3) The three CPUs that show up at the end of screen 4 on level four can actually be destroyed with only 2 grenades (I had to do this once when my grenade supply got low), but the best strategy is to lob five grenades at one of the outside CPUs (note that you can only have four grenades per player in the air at any given time, so space them out a bit), then go for the CENTER one (with another five grenades). The final CPU can simply be shot with the standard rifle, and if you're standing on the opposite side of the screen from it, it won't be able to hit you. Don't waste any more grenades.
4) Once you learn how to defeat the final menace (at the end of screen 4 on level five -- the final level) you can get by it (rather) painlessly. Go all the way to one side. Use your gun to shoot out the two surrounding machines that are shooting at you. As soon as they are both gone, lob three grenades at the center machine. By this time, the two outer machines that you shot out have regenerated and are firing at you. Shoot them out again, followed by another volley of three grenades to the center machine. Repeat until the center machine is gone. This requires 20 to 40 grenades, so stock up on the last level (5-4). That is what that final level was for.

魂斗羅 (c) 1987 Konami.
(Contra)

In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien being. Two years later, a terrorist organization calling themselves Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

'Contra' is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also "3D maze" stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are:
Machine Gun: Auto-fire.
Spread gun [S]: Allows the player to fire 5 shots in an arc.
Laser: Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.
Fire Ball [F]: A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.
Rapid Bullets [R]: Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon. Works with the Machine Gun and Fire Ball.
Barrier [B]: Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.

The game consists of ten stages:
Stage 01: Jungle (horizontal scroll)
Stage 02: Inside Base 1 (3D maze)
Stage 03: Core of Base 1 (3D fixed)
Stage 04: Waterfall (vertical scroll)
Stage 05: Inside Base 2 (3D maze)
Stage 06: Core of Base 2 (3D fixed)
Stage 07: Snow Field (horizontal scroll)
Stage 08: Energy Zone (horizontal scroll)
Stage 09: Hangar (horizontal scroll)
Stage 10: Alien Lair (horizontal scroll)

- TRIVIA -

Contra was released in February 1987.

This game is known in Europe as "Gryzor".

Note: The Japanese version uses kanji (Chinese characters) to phonetically spell out 'Kon-to-ra', the Japanese transliteration of the name "Contra". This is an example of ateji, in which an artist uses kanji for their phonetic value rather than any meaning they may have.

Here are the official names of the characters: Bill Rizer (player 1) and Lance Bean (player 2). They were named after the following actors, all of which appeared in the 1986 movie, Aliens; Bill Rizer is named after the actors Bill Paxton and Paul Reiser, while Lance Bean is named after Lance Henriksen and Michael Biehn.

Bill Rizer makes an appearance as a supporting character in the 1992 Family Computer game "Wai Wai World 2 SOS!! - Paseri Jou".

The music from the final stage is also used for the final boss confrontation in "Wai Wai World" for the Family Computer.

Chad Johnson holds the official record for this game with 1, 546, 600 points on July 15, 2002.

Alpha Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.4 - 28XA-201) on March 10, 1988.

Literatures:
[JP] June 05, 1998; Contra [Konami Game Books Series 4]

- UPDATES -

The game's backstory differs between sources. The storyline written above is the one used by Japanese sources and later mentioned in canon in Contra: Shattered Soldier for the PlayStation 2. In the North American manual for the NES version, the time was changed from the 27th century to the present day, with the location moved from Galuga to an unnamed South American island. Bill and Lance were given the codenames 'Mad Dog' and 'Scorpion', names which were later used for 2 unrelated characters in the American-produced Contra 4 for the Nintendo DS.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Weapons
1) Shotgun: Your default weapon, can fire suprisingly fast.
2) Spread Gun: Shoots waves of expanding blobs. Outstanding.
3) Laser: Hold down fire for a longer beam. Powerful.
4) Fireball: Fires spinning red blobs.
5) Machine Gun: Rapid fire bullets. Sounds like a drum machine.
6) Rapid: Speeds up shotgun, fireball &amp; machine gun bullets. Handy.
7) Barrier: Complete invulnerability for a limited time. Nice.

* Use shots wisely: Jump shots and crouch shots allow you to attack while avoiding enemy attacks. Do not hesitate. Keep those shots going!

* Kill before being killed: if you see an enemy, shoot right away. Defeat them before they fire at you. Be the first one to attack!

* Tip for taking down the fortress: At the end of Stage 1 (the Jungle) and Stage 4 (the Waterfall), you will find yourself at the heavily fortified entrance of the next base. To gain access to the base, you will need to destroy the large sensor. The sensor in Stage 1 is guarded by a sniper and two mortar cannons, while the sensor in Stage 4 is guarded by a large five-way cannon at middle, with two rotating guns around it (one on each side).

* Tips for 3-D mazes: Destroy the orb-shaped sensors in each wall to stop the high voltage electric currents. Taking out the weak points quickly is key to conquering the 3-D levels before time runs out. 

If you press the joystick upward and touch the electricity, you will be stunned and won't be able to move for a while. Don't move forward until you take out the sensor and stop the electricity. 

After you take out the weak point, look at the map while proceeding. You'll know whether to go left or right. 

You can dodge enemy bullets by lying down! Destroy rolling mines by using crouch shots.

As you proceed, there are weak points that are positioned so that you can't reach them. Utilize jump shots and crouch shots.

* Beware of falling off at Stage 4: In the waterfall, missing a platform and falling down will count as a miss.

* Barrier: The Barrier power-up can only be found at the beginning of Stage 4 (the Waterfall) or halfway through Stage 9 (the Hangar) if the player has only their normal gun equipped

* Rapid Bullets: The Rapid Bullets power-up will only appear in the beginning of the Waterfall stage and halfway through Snow Field stage (before fighting the first tank) if the player has only the normal gun equipped. Because of this, the only weapons the Rapid Bullets upgrade can be used with are the normal gun, the Fire Ball gun, and the Machine Gun.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Bee Medals: There are bee medals hidden in the whole game. If you shoot where a bee medal is hidden, it starts to blink. Then you will need to use your laser to free it, before you can collect the medal.

* Hits: There is a combo score system for hits within a specific time range. If it takes too long for your next hit, the chain breaks and counting restarts.

* Hidden 1up player: In stage 3 is your one and only chance to pick up a 1up item. It is hidden in the giant red spaceship you will pass later in the stage. To get it, open all 6 side-boxes with your laser, before you destroy the main tower in the center of the ship. You are not allowed to use your smartbomb for these actions. Otherwise the 1up item would not appear in the ruins of the tower afterwards.

* Bomb Stock: If you don't use the smartbombs and keep the stock display at 'maximum' bonus multiplier will be 2x.

* Flower bloom: There are a few places in the game you will meet flowers growing in ruins. If you fly near them they will bloom. This is more than just a joke of the graphic artist. It can reward you with a nice bonus score:
(each) flower blooming: 10 points per 1/60 sec.
+ your shots hit it: 510 points per bullet
+ your laser crosses it: 1'100 points per 1/30 sec.

* Second loop: To access the second (harder) loop thus being able to fight against Hibachi, the 'true' final boss after level 6 boss, you have to complete the first 6 levels with only one credit and meet at least one of these conditions:
- Don't lose more than 2 fighters (lives). 
- Depending on the fighter, have a maximum hit count of at least: 
Type A: 270 hits 
Type B: 300 hits 
Type C: 330 hits 
- At least 50 million points by the end of level 6. 
- Collect all 13 bees in four of the 6 areas using the tactic explained above for 'bee medals'.

- TRIVIA -

Garou Densetsu Special was released in September 1993 in Japan.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf Special'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Fatal Fury Special'.

Things that changed in this particular game:
* The combo system has been improved, hit damage has been lessened &amp; the game speed has been increased.
* Newcomers in the game are Duck King, Tung Fu Rue, Geese Howard &amp; Ryo Sakazaki.

Is Kim Kaphwan trying to replace Superman? You'll see for yourself when you spot him flying in Big Bear's &amp; Terry Bogard's stages!

Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu Special - PCCB-00138) on 21/10/1993.

- UPDATES -

MVS (arcade) vs. Home (neo-geo) differences:
- Home: After the credits you will see all the characters grouped together and it will say to try a harder difficulty. If you beat it in the hardest difficulty it will say 'Perfect! It's a knockout, Superman!'.
- Home: If playing on the hardest difficulty and you fought Ryo Sakazaki, you will see all the characters moving around him in a circle while he, for some reason, is crying.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Fight against Ryo Sakazaki: Beat the game without losing a single round (you can lose continues, but not rounds). You'll face against "Art of Fighting"'s main character Ryo Sakazaki as a powerful extra end boss!

* Beat the game without using a single continue and after the credits you will see every character performing a special move, their portraits and giving a quote.

(Garou Densetsu - Shukumei no Tatakai)

Terry Bogard &amp; Andy Bogard enter in a tournament called the King of Fighters where they must face dangerous fighters in order to find their father's murderer, none other than the tournament's sponsor &amp; supreme champion: Geese Howard. Joe Higashi also enters the tournament in search of the championship title. Who will come out victorious? The main features in this story-driven fighter are backgrounds that feature two battle planes for pseudo 3-D action, &amp; excellent music!

- TRIVIA -

Garou Densetsu was released in November 1991 in Japan.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf - Battle of Destiny'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Fatal Fury - King of Fighters'. 

Originally called 'Real Bout', SNK opted to change the title to 'Fatal Fury'. You can see the game's original title on the banner of a store in the background of Hwa Jai's stage ('Real Bout Shop').

According to the USA flyer, the name of the game is 'Fatal Fury - The Battle of Fury'. On the ingame titlescreen, however, it's called 'Fatal Fury - King of Fighters'.

The official name of the tournament is 'The King of Fighters'. This can be verified if you look closely the promo poster seen in the name rankings. Later SNK would use this name for a popular game series of its own.

The music in a 2-player battle is taken from the first stage of "Street Smart".

This is the very first game that featured one of SNK's most famous fighters: Terry Bogard! Over the years, Terry Bogard has appeared in many games, usually in his familiar jacket with a star on his back and a cap on his head. However, what is on his cap is different (probably because he tosses so many of them, but that's a different story). Some games have him wear a blank cap, some have his cap say 'Running Wild', some have the Neo-Geo logo on them, but the commonly accepted cap is the one that says 'Fatal Fury' on it.

Terry Bogard appears in "Quiz King of Fighters" as selectable character.

This game was such a hit in Japan that an animated movie was released featuring character designs by Masami Ohbari. This movie's plot is fairly true to the game's main plot and all the characters in the game are featured. The movie was released on the USA by courtesy of Viz Video, a division of Viz Comics.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu, Last Resort - PCCB-00087) on 21/05/1992.

- UPDATES -

The Japanese version features quite different move list sets for the three main characters (In the Fatal Fury sequels as well as the King of Fighters, Terry, Andy &amp; Joe's move list sets are clearly based on the Japanese release of this particular game). All other versions feature very simplified joystick commands for each move.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

As the game sometimes says on the continuation screen, you can tell some opponents' weak points by watching their moves carefully, which can help you figure out how to beat them. Here are a few examples:

-- If you've knocked down an opponent, you can damage them some more by charging at them with a 'dash attack' just as they're getting up, until they've been fully beaten. This may work best when playing with Andy Bogard.

-- When Tung Fu Rue changes into a hefty beast Incredible Hulk-style, he'll be briefly intangible as he beats his chest. Wait until the right moment and then dash at him (or, if you're playing with Joe Higashi, you can use his rapid punch). He won't actually fall on the ground in this form, but he'll be easier to beat until he turns back to normal as long as you can keep dash-attacking him.

-- When you're facing Hwa Jai, he'll be thrown a bottle of some kind of drink by an agent of Geese standing within the crowd of spectators, and after drinking it (during which time he'll be briefly intangible too), that's when he really lets loose with damaging attacks. If you feel Hwa Jai's too hard to deal with this way, you can try to cause him damage by a small amount, and if your lifebar is still higher than his, you can then step back on defense. He'll try hitting you with standard punches and kicks, but will not throw you, and this way, you can keep on the defensive until the timer runs out, winning simply by having more life energy left than he does.

-- When facing Billy Kane, if his pole falls away (he can either throw it at you or it can fall when he's thrown to the ground), he'll go on the defensive until another agent of Geese's tosses him another pole from within the crowd on the bridge. When he jumps up to grab hold of it, that's when you can move in and try to grab and throw him to the ground, or ram him with a dash attack.

Finally, when facing Geese Howard in the showdown match, you can move towards him as the round begins and then grab and throw him to the ground, then, by timing your attacks correctly, you can grab him in a body slam again when he gets up, eventually beating him by body-slamming him repeatedly. It's a tricky strategy, but it can work!

- TRIVIA -

Garou Densetsu 2 was released in December 1992 in Japan.

The title of the translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf 2 - The New Battle'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Fatal Fury 2'. According to the USA flyer, the name of the game is 'Fatal Fury 2 - The Sultan of Slugs Battle Royale'.

Things that changed in this sequel:
* This game allows you to switch between the background &amp; foreground planes at will (in the first game, you could only switch planes if the CPU was on a different battle plane!).
* The game ditches the previous game's 3 button setup (punch, kick &amp; throw) in favor of a new 4 button setup (light &amp; heavy punches &amp; kicks). This is apparently one of the very first Neo-Geo fighters to use this now common button setup.
* This game introduces the use of Desperation Moves (highly damaging techniques that can only be used when the life-bar is flashing red). This game as well as "Art of Fighting" were the first fighting games to introduce these moves.
* Newcomers in the game are: Mai Shiranui, Cheng Sinzan, Kim Kaphwan, Jubei Yamada, Big Bear (aka Raiden), Axel Hawk, Lawrence Blood &amp; Wolfgang Krauser. Richard Meyer, Michael Max, Tung Fu Rue, Duck King, Hwa Jai &amp; Geese Howard were left out! (although some of them make some cameos during some of the game's cut-scenes!).

Just as the first game introduced the famed Terry Bogard, this game features SNK's most popular fighter lady: Mai Shiranui!:). Mai appears in "Quiz King of Fighters" as selectable character.

The Hungry Wolf is a reference to Terry Bogard, the main character in Fatal Fury. Terry, Andy and Joe (and to a lesser extent, Mai and Mary) are referred to as the Lone Wolves.

Keeping the tradition of the first game, an animated movie based on this game was released in Japan featuring character designs by Masami Ohbari. The movie was also released in the USA by Viz Video, a division of Viz Comics. After the second Fatal Fury movie was released, a third movie followed (which predated "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory"). It follows the adventures of the Lonely Wolves (Terry, Andy, Joe and Mai) as they attempt to prevent a power-hungry man from claiming all the parts of the legendary Armor of Mars.

When a player wins a match in a single player game, the post match screen shows people watching the tournament inside the Pao Pao Cafe from the first game, "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters".

Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu 2 - PCCB-00111) on 19/02/1993.

Reviews:
[FR] March 1993 - Consoles + No. 18: 97/100 (AES version)

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* You can only see any character's ending if you beat the game with a single credit used (no continues or 2-Player matches are allowed)

* Just like the first game, it's possible to use the strategy of dashing at your opponents just as they're getting up in order to damage them repeatedly.

* Billy Kane, Axel Hawk and Lawrence Blood all have stages that use a single plane, with the 'second' plane having objects on it that can injure players if they're knocked against them (all three of these bosses have ways of throwing their opponents into the background). You can knock the bosses into the background too by standing close to them while they're dazed and then hitting them with a good hard kick or punch.

(Garou Densetsu 3 - Harukanaru Tatakai)

During a trip to Southtown to attend the inauguration of a new branch of Pao Pao Cafe by former street fighter Richard Meyer, the lone wolves (Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi &amp; Mai Shiranui) are unwillingly caught in the middle of a desperate search for the Shiranui Scrolls and the mysterious fighters that are after them! The game features a new graphic style, 2 different background planes to fight, a grade system that shows how well you perform in battle, lots of hidden moves &amp; combos, as well as multiple endings based on your performance. The answers shall only be uncovered by a long &amp; fierce battle, are you up to it?

- TRIVIA -

Garou Densetsu 3 was released in March 1995 in Japan.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf 3 - The Distant Battle'.

Garou Densetsu 3 overtly refers to itself by its overseas name of 'Fatal Fury 3' throughout the game.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory'.

Things that changed in this particular game:
* The game introduces a deeper plane change system which proved to be somewhat clunky &amp; difficult to use due to the tricky commands used to move between planes.
* Chain combos are introduced to add even more depth to each character's fighting style. 
* Throws are harder to use since these are slow and throw-miss animations were added.
* Newcomers in the game are Bob Wilson, Blue Mary, Franco Bash, Hon Fu, Sokaku Mochizuki, Ryuji Yamazaki, Jin Chonshu &amp; Jin Chonrei.

Hon Fu's goofy martial artist routine &amp; easygoing personality make him SNK's hilarious homage to Jackie Chan. Definitely not a Bruce Lee clone!:)

Kyo Kusanagi &amp; Sie Kensou make a cameo in Pao Pao Cafe!

Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu 3 - PCCB-00179) on April 21, 1995.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Reach and beat Jin Chonshu with a fighting grade above "A" and you'll fight a hidden last boss, her brother, Jin Chonrei.

One of the coolest things of this game is the fact that you can alter some backgrounds objects by slamming opponents against them. For example, you can knock away the training dummy in Joe's stage if you send an opponent flying towards it. Experiment on various stages to find more surprises!

Note: If the game is set on the USA, ASIA or EUROPE bios, the game will reset after defeating Jin Chonrei and you won't get to see the ending, however if the game is set on the JAPAN bios it will work just fine!

		<name>Garou - Mark of the Wolves</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 23 years ago:

Garou - Mark of the Wolves (c) 1999 SNK.

Garou: Mark of the Wolves is a one-on-one fighting game and is the 9th title in SNK's Fatal Fury series. Ten years after crime-lord Geese Howard's death, the city of Southtown is now a peaceful place, leading it to be known as the Second Southtown. A new fighting tournament called King of Fighters: Maximum Mayhem is created, with several characters related to fighters from the previous "King of Fighters" tournaments participating.

The game features 12 characters and foregoes the plane-switching style of its predecessors in favour of standard, single-plane battles. Garou introduced the "Tactical Offense Position" (T.O.P.), a special area on the fighter's life gauge. When the gauge reaches this area, the character enters the T.O.P. mode, granting them the ability to use T.O.P. attack, gradual life recovery, and increased attack damage. 

The game also introduced the Just Defend system, which rewards players who successfully block an attack at the last moment, granting them a small amount of health recovery and the ability to immediately counter-attack out of block stun.

If players win all rounds with a ranking of AAA, they will face the boss 'Kain R. Heinlein', defeating him unlocks a special ending. If the AAA requirements are not met, Grant will be the final boss and there will be no special ending. Additionally, before facing Grant players will face a mid-boss, who, depending on which character the player is using, can be any character from the game's cast.

- TRIVIA -

Released in November 1999.

'Garou' translates from Japanese as 'Hungry Wolf'. 'Mark of the Wolves' is a reference to the legacy left behind by Terry to a new generation of fighters - specifically, Rock Howard. This can also refer to the legacy left by other characters from the previous Fatal Fury &amp; Art of Fighting games. Kim Dong Hwan &amp; Kim Jae Hoon are sons of Tae-Kwon Do fighter Kim Kaphwan. Khushmood Butt is a master of Kyokugenryu Karate, the same martial used by Ryo Sakazaki from Art of Fighting. Hokutomaru uses Shiranui-style Ninjitsu as his fighting style, this is the same ninja arts that Mai Shiranui uses, however Hokutomaru was trained by Andy Bogard.

Garou pushes the capabilities of the Neo-Geo MVS hardware to its limit, giving some of the best-looking graphics to date. Some critics saying that there is life after all in the Neo-Geo hardware, which was past its prime when the game was released.

Hokutomaru's stage has quite a few references to the rest of the "Fatal Fury" series. To the extreme left of the stage is a billboard with a picture of the old style Terry Bogard. A portrait of Geese Howard and his lieutenants can be seen on another billboard (this is the same picture that is seen in the flyer for Real Bout Fatal Fury). There is also a picture of Andy Bogard and Mai Shiranui holding hands posing as a bank advertisement right above another picture of Alfred.

The sign that Khushnood Butt shows off in his victory pose is a Kyokugen Karate dojo sign.

The Rock Howard music stage contains a part of Robert Miles' seminal trance tune "Children" (1996).

Rock Howard is the son of the notorious crime-lord Geese Howard, the boss of previous Fatal Fury games. Rock was trained to fight by Terry Bogard and has incorporated moves from Terry and Geese's styles into his own fighting style. Rock is also related to Garou's main boss of the game: Kain R. Heinlein. Geese Howard married Marie Heinlein, whom is the sister of Kain. So, we can assume that Kain is Rock's uncle.

The word 'Tizoc' (The Griffon Mask's Japanese name) means 'sick leg', or 'lame leg'. It was the name of an ancient Mexican tlatoani, or leader, who ruled from 1481 until 1486, when he was poisoned by Aztec aristocrats.

If a double KO occurs, a round is won by each fighter, which can end a battle on this quite unsatisfying note. Moreover in this case, the player has no fighting level, neither displayed on the screen nor counted for the points.

Soundtracks release:
[JP] Jan. 21, 2000; Garou - Mark of the Wolves [SCDC-00006] Scitron

- UPDATES -

The prototype version has a white background at the title screen instead a blue background on the final version. It has also a graphic bug on the Terry Bogard stage during the second round at the extreme right.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Random Fighter: Hold Start and press a Punch or Kick button at the character selection screen.

* Play as Grant: At the character select screen, highlight Dong Hwan, hold Start and press Up(x2) Down(x2), Up, Down.

* Play as Kain R. Heinlein: At the character select screen, highlight Jae Hoon, hold Start and press Down(x2), Up(x2), Down, Up.

* Play against Kain R. Heinlein: To reach Kain, you must finish the first 7 matches with an average fighting level of AAA. Your best bet would be to avoid losing any rounds throughout the preliminary 7 stages, especially Grant. If you meet this condition after defeating Grant, you'll get a cutscene featuring Kain R. Heinlein. Beat Kain to reveal your characters' true ending.

* Alternate Costume Colors: Each character has 4 colors, corresponding to each button.

* Secret Taunts: After defeating your opponent, hold Left or Right and tap Start to use an hidden taunt. Every character has two secret taunts (these can ONLY be used after defeating an opponent and before your character goes into his/her winning pose). Some of them, such as Hotaru's and Hokutomaru's are really cool!:)

Taunts in the game can affect the background stages in many ways. For example, by using a taunt during a fight in Hotaru's stage (Philanthropy Belfry) you can make the bells in the background move. Most stages have hidden animations that can only be seen by this trick so try it!:)

* Survival Mode: Insert a coin, hold A+B+C+D and press Start. You will then play a Survival Mode (quite hard one too).

* Rock's Win-pose: Rock will have a special win-pose when he finishes the opponent with a Shine Knuckle and a different one when he finishes the opponent with either a Raging Storm or the Deadly Rave Neo.

Ghost Pilots (c) 1991 SNK.

Ghost Pilots is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players set in World War II. An ambitious Nazi general has sent his forces against the Allies andwo freelance ace pilots  called Tom Phillips and Charlie Stingley, nicknamed 'Ghost Pilots', set off in their seaplanes to combat the Axis forces head on.

Before starting a stage, the player must choose one of two bomb types. In one of the two stages after the first, the player also has the option to choose a third unique bomb type (napalm bomb in the land strike stage and air mines in the air strike stage). At the start of the game a player starts with three bombs and can collect up to a maximum of nine bombs. In a two-player game, both players cannot choose the same bomb type.

Enemies consist of tanks, gunboats, jets and a number of other military units. Shooting a row of red planes grants collectible power-ups giving either stronger and more widespread firepower, or additional bombs and extra lives. Certain medium-sized enemies destroyed grant collectible bonus stars for additional score. The player loses a life if the seaplane is hit by enemy projectiles orcollides with enemy craft.

An end-of-level boss fight awaits players at the end of every stage.

Space Invaders (c) 1978 Midway Mfg. Co.

Export version manufactured by Midway under license from Taito. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Taito upright model entry; "Space Invaders".

- TECHNICAL -

Game ID: 739
[Upright model]

Buttons: 3 (LEFT, RIGHT, FIRE)
(The US upright model had no joystick)

- TRIVIA -

Space Invaders was released by Midway Manufacturing, under license by Taito, in October 1978 in the USA.

The Space Invaders phenomenon stunned many conservative adults of the time who were convinced that video-games soured the minds of their youngsters. Residents of Mesquite, Texas, pushed the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in their efforts to ban the illicit machines from their Bible-belt community. A number of reported incidents of juvenile crime began to surface shortly after the game's release, adding to its 'controversy'. A girl was caught stealing $5,000 from her parents and gangs of youths were reported to have robbed grocery stores just so they would have money to play the game.

Of the reported 350,000 units produced world wide, about 65,000 units were produced in the U.S. alone.

Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games. According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders.

Space Invaders inspired a catchy hit song by 'Uncle Vic' called 'Space Invaders' released over the spring to summer-time period of 1980. The Pretenders also released an instrumental song called 'Space Invaders' on their debut album in 1980.

A Space Invaders unit appears in the 1980 movie 'Midnight Madness', in the 1982 movie 'Jekyll &amp; Hyde... Together Again', in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'The Iceman', in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day', and in the 1998 sitcom 'That 70's Show'; Season 4, Episode 8 (Donna's Story).

An upright unit of the Midway release of Space Invaders appears in the ZZ Top music video, 'Legs'.

ケツイ ～絆地獄たち～ (c) 2003 Cave.
(Ketsui - Kizuna Jigoku-tachi)

The continuous industrialization that started in 1900, finally led to unavoidable consequences in the middle of the 21st century. The waterlevel rose worldwide and threatened many coastal countries. So the shorelines had to be modified In order to save the human civilization from drowning. It was a time of great confusion about the future, and nobody thought about war. Well, almost... There was one company called EVAC corporation, who made a great profit from underhand productions and exports of weapon systems. When the United Nations discovered their illegal trades, they pointed EVAC to the global ban of weapon imports and exports, and asked them to stop their productions and to destroy their weapon facilities immediately. EVAC rejected all accusations and refused to take any actions. So a preventive war was started by the United Nations to stop the EVAC corporation.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* High Scoring: The key to high scoring is moving up close (VERY close) to your enemies and blasting them for point boxes labeled 1 through 5 (Five is worth the most, of course).

* Lock-Shot Properties: With Lock-Shot active your helicopter will move slower. You start with 2 pods, one on each side of the helicopter. each can lock onto a target. After powering up twice you will gain 2 more pods (total of 4) and have the ability to lock onto four separate targets. Usually you just have all pods lock onto one target for max damage. You do NOT do more damage closer to enemies. However, when closer, you lock on faster, and less enemies will be in the way of your pods and the target, so you will end up dealing more. Your Helicopter will shoot a beam out in front. It CANNOT reach full screen! You will see it end at about 3/4 from the bottom. The Beam DOES do damage, albeit very little, but it can add up. Lock-Shot will lock onto enemies quicker the closer you are. It will not let go until you release A or the target is destroyed. During Boss Battles, it is quicker to hold C, wait just until the Boss can be damaged, then hold down A. You have to be close for this. Enemies will drop more Chips when Lock-Shot mode is active. You must get in the habit of keeping Lock-Shot HELD DOWN even after an enemy is destroyed, because there are several that will continue to drop boxes even after death or explode multiple times.

* The Score Bar:
- 1st Row: Multiplier Overall Counter. Multiplier used in [after] the boss fight. It's the total sum of all chips gathered up until the boss fight. Unless you die, it will not deplete until the boss fight.
- 2nd Row: Multiplier Counter (1-999). 
Multiplier used in stage. Grows as you gather Multiplier Chips, but depletes as you use your lock shot, and if you die.
- Multiplier Chip Rate: The type of chip you get when you kill enemies with the lock shot. When the Multiplier timer reaches 0, it'll be reset when you kill an enemy with your normal shot, and is valid until the timer reaches 0.
- 3rd Row: Current chip NUMBER (1-5). Measures the time the chip rate is valid. Will rise as you kill enemies with the shot or lock shot, but the chip rate will return to 1 when the timer hits zero. The multiplier is raised as you gather multiplier chips. Basically you need to remember that killing an enemy at close distance produces are larger chip. Conversely, what depletes the multiplier is destroying enemies with the lock shot. Depending on the type of enemy, they can take off up to 1/30 to 1/10 of the entire value (popcorn enemies deplete it by a small amount, whereas bosses deplete it by a large one). If you die, it will decrease by 1/4.
- Characteristics of the multiplier at the boss fight: Unlike points 1 and 2, during the boss fight, the value of the overall multiplier counter is applied straight up. However, there's few chances to raise it during the boss fight, and it will quickly deplete as time passes. Certain bosses are better to ignore their parts and just kill quickly.

* End of Level Bonus = TOTAL CHIPS AQUIRED x (LIVES x 500 points + BOMBS X 50 points)

* Boss form change timing: you want your bullets from Shot to destroy the boss, but be able to get into Lock-Shot mode. I get the bosses life bar just a bit before the form change. You must get the feel.
These are for 1P.
&gt; 1st Boss: between N and S of INSERT COIN
&gt; 2nd Boss: between S and E of INSERT COIN
&gt; 3rd Boss: the 1P score in the middle of the 100s place
&gt; 4th Boss: First Form: Between N and S of INSERT COIN. Second Form: The 1P score between 1000 and 100.
&gt; 5th Boss: First Form: There is no marking to indicate, if you constantly damage him with Lock-Shot, it is when he returns to his first pattern. Second Form: The 1P score at about 10,000. I don't look at this, it is during the second time of his final attack.

* Loops requirements:
- NORMAL "TSUUJOU" LOOP - Total DEATHS + BOMBS =&gt; 6
&gt; Instead of releasing chips, enemies release Suicide bullets.
&gt; Suicide Bullets are PINK.
&gt; Chip Number is ALWAYS 1.
&gt; You can stop suicide bullets from being released (seal) by being within a certain radius of enemies.
&gt; If suicide bullets are sealed, then no chips are gained.
&gt; Difficulty is drastically increased.

- SPECIAL "URA" LOOP (AKA REVERSE LOOP/SIDE) - NO MISS/NO BOMBS, 120+ Million Score
&gt; A text message is given "WELCOME TO THE SPECIAL ROUND" before starting.
&gt; Suicide bullets are BLUE.
&gt; There is a greater number of suicide bullets and they are quicker.
&gt; The distance which you can seal suicide bullets is decreased.
&gt; When suicide bullets are sealed, the number that was due to be discharged will be added to your multiplier (I will figure it out exactly as I get there)
&gt; The rate of decrease when an enemy is destroyed with lock-shot is decreased.
&gt; During Boss Battles, the reduction speed of the Total Multiplier Overall Counter is slowed.
&gt; End of round bonus DOUBLES.
&gt; During the 5th Boss, after the second form is destroyed, DOOM will appear.

- TRIVIA -

Released in July 2000.

About Ramon: This character was designed with one of Neo-Geo's major markets in mind, South America. He's a stout, masked wrestler who uses tricky body slam moves. These 3 points form the major concept behind the creation of Ramon. Ramon's designer at the time loved pro-wrestling fighting moves, and we remember him carefully studying these. The fruits of this labor crystallized themselves in the Lucha Dolore known as Ramon. With his use of 'Lucha Libre' moves and not those of traditional 'pro-wrestling', the staff team hope you can enjoy experiencing the attention to detail, intensity, and enthusiasm of Ramon's designer at that time.

About Vanessa: Vanessa's entrance in KOF at the time put a stop to the parade of increasingly younger characters appearing in the game, especially the women characters who were all teenagers for the most part. This is the reason for creating the concept of a thirty-something woman who broke all the rules and overflowed with adult appeal. Her style has become the topic of many humorous comic strips. In her first appearance in the Sega Dreamcast version of KOF '99 as a Striker character, she was a bit irreverent. And in KOF 2000, she officially entered the tournament as a player character. Designers wanted to introduce her as a player character in KOF '99, but legend has it that she had to sit it out due to certain time constraints.

About Lin: This character was selected out of the encyclopedic character background materials (whose volume would rival the Encyclopedia Britannica!) of the supervising planners. Lin is tied to the Flying Brigands 'HIzoku', who were introduced as a KOF side story in the NESTS Chronicles, but without the knowledge of the staff, and when Ron showed up in the ending sequence, there were some awfully surprised designers. With all the special moves and actions for this character the programmers and planners had a rough time working on this character. He brought tears to the eyes of the developers, but not for the usual reasons.

About Seth: Seth was created as part of a set with Vanessa, appearing for the first time in the Sega Dreamcast version of KOF '99. His initial name was 'Dick'. The name had deep significance for his designer. Based on the strong wishes of the supervising designer, the powerful image of a big, dark, middle-aged man with a Mohawk haircut who used the arts of self-defense was decided on. Since Seth was created first, Vanessa's clothes were designed to match his. This made some people surmise things like Seth was Vanessa's husband.

About Hinako Shijo: At first designers sought to create a character similar to Chie in the Japanese comic Jarinko Chie (Downtown Story) who used sumo moves. The supervising designer, however, succumbed to insistent requests to use 'a debutante', and Hinako gradually transformed into a wellborn young maiden. She was to fight barefoot, but that idea got eighty-sixed. The tape remaining on her fingers is a tiny remnant of her original concept. Since her appearance grew further and further away from that of a sumo wrestler, the names for her moves use those of actual sumo moves to preserve the essence of the sumo wrestler in her original character.

About Kula Diamond: To add dimensions to the villainous NESTS organization of the NESTS Chronicles and excitement to the story, the need to create an enemy for the huge and individualistic K' arose. Manipulator of the 'Anti-K' Arts', her ice symbolizes the foil to the flames of K'. That's what Kula Diamond's all about. During production Designers elicited the opinions of newly hired female designers regarding Kula's mannerisms to "make her girlish gestures appropriately girlish" (but left the actual design work to the veteran supervising designer). Designers think we succeeded in faithfully depicting a 14-year-old girl... Asking Kula's designer about his impressions at the time, he immediately answered: "Kula had an easy delivery. She didn't give me any pain". The actual work appeared difficult, but it seems he enjoyed his work.

About Candy Diamond: Candy is the robot you can see during Kula's Special Move displays, animated sequences, and as a Striker. Since Candy's not a player character she doesn't stand out like the other characters, but she does appear in the gut-wrenching episode that depicts her emotions for Kula when she's torched saving her mistress in the Kula ending of KOF 2000. If you haven't yet seen this, what're you waiting for? Hurry up and clear the game with Kula to find out!

About Zero: Zero is the boss of Krizalid from KOF '99, but his position in a company would be similar to that of 'division chief'. Because of his black beard and noble manner, designers are sure he's regarded as a rather scary 'division chief' in the organization. His guiltless betrayal of Krizalid speaks volumes about his true personality, in stark contrast to his dislike of traitors listed in his profile. Incidentally, The names of some of Zero's moves come from the Japanese anime 'Hokuto no Ken'.

About Diana: Diana's the Amazon featured in Kula's sequences. She used to be a top executive for NESTS but is portrayed as Kula's guardian in the background story. If you compared NESTS to a company... designers often use this metaphor, but designers don't have a clue which position would fit her or Foxy. Judging by her loathing of elite managers (college boys), designers could say she's a 'big-sister section chief' who climbed the corporate ladder with extremely hard work. Working with a "fabulous babe" boss like her would be whack (but a bit scary, though)!

Robert's 'Ryuugeki Ken' is a knock-off of the Sonic Boom (It isn't in "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle" because of its looks, despite the charging motion).

There are 2 symbolic things that tell you how the people at SNK were forseeing the end of their company. Kyo's theme is called 'Good Bye Esaka', Esaka is the avenue where the SNK building and Neo Geo Land are (Esaka means 'entrance to the hill'). The second thing is the destruction of the city that started all: South Town (Home of "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting" - however, note that in "Garou - Mark of The Wolves", Second South was rebuilt near South Town. Also noted is the fact that every Kyo theme before 'Tears' had 'Esaka' in it ('Esaka' in 94, 'Funky Esaka' in 95, 'Esaka?' in 96 and 'Esaka Forever' in 97).
The reason for those names is that in "The King of Fighters '94", Kyo's team stage is below a bridge in the Esaka area near SNK. In "The King of Fighters '95", they fight in front of Neo Geo Land, again, in Esaka in front of the SNK building. In "The King of Fighters '96", they fight in top of a bridge also in the Esaka area. In "The King of Fighters '97" there is no Esaka stage, however, this was supposed to be the last KOF as SNK planned to move to the Hyper NeoGeo 64, it was like a glorious farewell to KOF, however, things went different. Finally, in "The King of Fighters '98 - The Slugfest", the Esaka stage appears again; they fight below a bridge in front of the Neo Geo Land.

Released in August 1994.

The King of Fighters (or KOF for short) revolutionized the fighter genre with the introduction of 3 member team fighting called the 'team battle system', and by combining elements of two of SNK's existing fighting game in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting", as well as bringing back characters from games predating the MVS in "Ikari Warriors" and "Psycho Soldier". A new game in the series is produced every year.

At the demo previous to the first Rugal encounter, Rugal shows your team the statues he has gathered by turning his opponents into them. One of the statues is of a guy that looks a lot like Capcom's Guile making a Sonic Boom. Capcom later confirmed that it was indeed Guile's statue in "Capcom Vs. SNK - Millenium Fight 2000". When Guile fights Rugal that statue is shown and later destroyed by Guile.

Kyo Kusanagi: Since Kyo was created as a snazzy character capable of holding his own against the main characters of "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting", coming up with the right design was quite a lengthy undertaking. Kyo's personality remained a mystery until the final stages of development. Originally, he was to be called 'Sho Kirishima', but during the latter stages of development, his designers decided on the name of Kyo Kusanagi, and Sho got a rapid name change. The setting for the Orochi Saga, in which we learn that Kyo's ancestors defeated the Orochi of the Yamata, began with this game.

Benimaru Nikaido: This character was loosely based on a comic book character (Jean-Pierre Polnaref from "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure"), and even after the name of Benimaru was decided on, game developers gave the poor guy an identity crisis by continuing to call him by the comic book character's name. The voice for this character, too, had a peculiar bent to it, and when Benimaru's designer heard his creation's victory line of 'Thank you' recited for the first time, rumor has it that he couldn't work for days after: the reading had nothing to do with the character's original image. His speech patterns have led some to question Benimaru's preferences as far as certain lifestyles are concerned.

Goro Daimon: This character comes from the designers' desire to create a judo athlete who uses dynamic body tosses. His initial designs incurred the criticism of some fellow designers who were of the opinion that it was just plain loopy for Daimon to fight wearing Japanese geta (wooden clogs), but Goro's creators were adamant and he kept his footwear. The suggestions for his laconic victory lines and the sound of an explosion when Goro is victorious also stuck.

Terry Bogard: When the concept for KOF was first formulated, Terry was tacked on to the roster as an afterthought, but his popularity skyrocketed! He became the character who got the designers' utmost attention, and they fretted over various aspects of his character. In the first KOF, Terry became the powerhouse, getting a super punch cancel move added to his arsenal and becoming the fearsome character he is today.

Andy Bogard: Compared to Andy's original form ("Fatal Fury - King of Fighters"), Andy changed little in his move to KOF, but what he got in return was the addition of his Ultra Disruptor move to his arsenal of moves. When first added, it boasted overwhelming power: it was easy to use, never missed, trumped other moves, and annihilated all opponents.

Joe Higashi: Joe is a character who underwent a major image makeover from his transition from "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters". The victory pose of KOF '94 initially lacked the toothy smile we're familiar with now. It was quite a thorn in the side that we felt inappropriate for Joe's legion of fans. So, in rethinking the original design, we added the pearly whites that makes Joe to loveable character he is today.

Ryo Sakazaki: Ryo (as can be said of all characters from "Art of Fighting") has so many Special Moves that it seems almost unfair to the other characters, and in the designing stage, the Art of Fighting team tended to be the strongest. The designers focused on adjusting this imbalance without taking out any moves, but in the end Ryo and his team remain the toughest competitors.

Robert Garcia: Overall, KOF's characters are fit and trim, but compared to their original concepts, Robert is the slimmest of them all. Matched up against Kensou, he chide his adversary in Japanese with an Osaka accent, allowing players to enjoy the amusing word play that Osaka comedians are known for.

Takuma Sakazaki: Since the Takuma of "Art of Fighting 2" closely resembled Daimon, he received a karate tunic in his ensemble to set him apart and that's why he looks the way he does today. He originally had a combo attack after the 'Super Shrike Gale' move that appeared to be a glitch. Hence, during game development, this move was taken out, but the game designers thought that he just wasn't Takuma without this move and it was put back in. The designers slightly regret their decision because Takuma's become quite a mean little bugger as a result.

Yuri Sakazaki: Yuri is a disciple of Kyokugen Karate but her appearances in the KOF series are frequently as a member of the women fighters' team. Originally in KOF '94 there was no such team and production began on King Billy Big Bear as the English team. But "Art of Fighting 2" was completed at that time and the designers pressed to put Yuri into KOF, replacing her with Big Bear, who was presenting various problems, for various reasons (hah, hah) concerning capacity. Enter Yuri, goodbye Billy! (A tragedy, we know) And so the originally planned team started life anew as the mighty women fighters' team.

Heidern: Heidern was devised as a cold-blooded killing machine when he first saw digital life, but as the KOF story unfolded, Heidern's designer identified with the character and provided him with a tragic past. When his super special moves were completed, the moves were so wild that game designers worried that he would have to be depicted as a sorcerer or an alien in order to explain his dazzling moves.

Ralf Jones: In the first stages of Ralf's development, he appeared shirtless to truly express the feeling of ikari or rage, but during the designing phase, someone felt his look was a bit dated and Ralf got the apparel he's now known and loved for. He originally had special moves that allowed him to use grenades, setting him apart from other team members, and a distinctive design, but his use of grenades in a fighting competition was deemed a bit unfair, so he lost that particular talent.

Clark Steel: At the beginning of development, the only differences in designs for Ralf and Clark was one had a hat and the other had a bandanna, but Clark later got a pair of sunglasses to become the character he is today. Clark basically looks a lot like Ralf, but since the designer in charge of adjusting this character worked on his hit accuracy, action speed and attack strength, their combat style is where the true differences between the two can be found.

Athena Asamiya: Given that Athena is always the most highly anticipated character of the series, the pressure to keep her on the roster at any cost is pretty overwhelming. And because SNK staff focuses so much on her, SNK have been accused of favoritism. Japanese fans asked SNK to dress her in a sailor blouse and skirt, but we scrubbed that idea because SNK felt it wouldn't translate overseas and be a bit too risque. But SNK made up for that omission with her wild entrance actions (Hubba! Hubba!).

Sie Kensou: Compared with Athena, Kensou's design has been a bit slapdash. In the previous title, Athena stole the show and since we felt Kensou was a bit too overshadowed by her, SNK gave him a radically new look to appeal to our female fans. We're often asked about Kensou's use of Japanese with an Osaka accent in the game, but he's always done that since his Psycho Soldier days. In other words, he's been doing it far longer than Robert has.

Chin Gentsai: When SNK first decided to try our hands at a fighting game, SNK felt we just had to have a geezer who used the Drunken Fist form of martial arts. Getting the OK, SNK introduced this character as Athena's teacher. As we aimed to create a genuine Drunken Fist master, SNK thought it would be hard to get the right touch, but since designer was good at drawing old guys, the finished product far exceeded original expectations. Unfortunately for the designer, he was unable to shake this habit and all of his subsequent characters tended to look like spry old men.

Mai Shiranui: Regarding Mai's familiar pause action... One day, the designer for Mai asked if it was all right to increase Mai's pause actions, and because the powers that be thought there was enough remaining memory for the game (actually there wasn't) they said, 'Go for it'. When the completed pose was presented, it knocked people flat. Due to this pose's potency, however, Mai's eye-popping motions were stilled in the KOF '94 international home version.

King: As far as King's super special moves go, there were various reasons why the 'Surprise Rose' was initially scheduled to be scrapped. Just when the development staff was worrying about coming up with a move that was something different, though, King's designer whipped this move up, it was well received, and it became her super special move, with no alterations needed.

Heavy D!: Since there has been a number of boxers in fighting games, Heavy D! was designed with the intent to create a different type of pugilist. When he first appeared on the drawing board, D! was not intended to be that big a character, but as he evolved and stood among the other characters it became apparent that he was one huge dude. ...Due to certain production circumstances, however, D! kept his imposing stature and came to be the character he is today.

Lucky Glauber: Known as the basketball fighter, Lucky's original image was based on the character appearing in the Bruce Lee movie, 'Game of Death'. Though originally created with that image in mind, his first design was deemed too plain and he then received his current look. His ability to use karate, though, is a remnant of his original conception.

Brian Battler: Brian came into being well before the KOF project came down the pike, and he's one of the oldest characters. He originally wore a helmet and chest pad, but he shed that equipment to arrive at his current design.

Kim Kaphwan: At first, the duo of Chang and Choi were set to team with another vicious criminal to form the Fugitive Team, but due to certain circumstances the third criminal was replaced with Kim and the familiar team came into being. The addition of Kim was considered somewhat forced, however, so Kim received the mission of rehabilitating the two.

Chang Koehan: Chang was originally far more violent than he is today, but once he teamed up with Kim, he became mellowed a bit. Chang's super special move, the Wild Ball, was originally designed as a test move, but it got such a good response that it was put into the game without alteration. This move is a pastiche of Kim's Phoenix Kick.

Choi Bounce: Choi is KOF's mighty novelty character. His original design looked way too much like a certain someone, so he was hastily given a new look a month before the final character designs had to be completed, giving Choi's designers one major headache. The first time Choi displayed his attacking and retreating moves and rolled around the screen, he revealed not only his fighting abilities but his talent for physical comedy.

An interesting thing about Chang and Choi: Chang was the tallest and heaviest KOF character, while Choi was the lightest and shortest. The duo is very popular in Japan, but hated by American fans. Because of their size differences, they have made a (quite) comedic couple, making the Korean team (or the Kim team) the comedy-relief team of KOF.

Rugal Bernstein: The concept for this character at the time was to make the mightiest (most violent) and most evil boss character ever. As everyone knows, Rugal is the King of Bosses who boasts the most appearances in the KOF series as a boss character, but even considering the whole genre known as 'competitive fighting games', his story and moves have changed ever so gradually while appearing in so many titles, he's one of the few bosses to have been loved (heh, heh) over such a long period.

Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

Brazil Stage's background music (Jungle Bouncer) samples "Surprise! You're Dead!", a song from Faith No More (1989).

The background music from USA Stage (Slum No. 5), Japan Stage (Esaka) and the 2nd Rugal Stage (Showdown R &amp; D) all contain voice samples from "Gutfest '89", a song from Digital Underground.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '94 - PCCB-00162) on 21/10/1994.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Select Victory Pose: Press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.

* Critical Hit Oddity: A critical hit is an attack done at the opponent while he/she is attacking. In this game there is a bug that enables either the CPU or the player to take out insane amounts of damage if this is done right. An easy-to-do example is to counter Kim's Hisho-Kyaku with Heidern's Moon Cutter (you must hit Kim's legs with Heidern's hand), if done right you'll take 80-90% off Kim's life-bar in one hit! Try it with other characters and be amazed (This does not work in any other game in the KOF series, though!).:)

* Beat the game without continuing to see all the characters grouped together on the The End screen.

- TRIVIA -

Released in July 1996.

This is the first game to include special phrases and poses when two characters in particular fight. In this game, it happens only with Kyo Vs. Iori, Terry Vs. Geese and Ralf Jones vs Clark Steel.

Ryo Sakazaki's fighting stance changed from the regular 'dukes up' to try and distance him from being thought of as a Ryu ripoff. His basic moves, however, remained unchanged.

Yuri's Yuri Chou Mawashi Geri is a knock-off of Ryu's Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku.

If you look at the game code for this game, you would have seen more moves that were originally planned for this game, but never made the cut (for some characters, these moves debuted in later games).
Among those moves that were cut were Kyo's Saishuu Kessen Ougi 'Mu Shiki', Daimon's Arashi no Yama, Robert's Muei Senpuu Juudan Kyaku, Ralf's Umanori Vulcan Punch, Clark's Running Three, Geese's Deadly Rave and Choi's Hou'ou Kyaku.

Geese's music (Geese ni Katakori) is a remixed version of his Fatal Fury 1 theme music (Geese ni Kiss).
A remixed version of Big Shot! (originally Terry's theme music in "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory") was used as the Fatal Fury Team's music.

About Leona: Along with the extensive overhaul to the team lineup of KOF '96, Leona entered the series as a replacement for Heidern, leader of the Ikari Team. Introducing the plot element of Heidern's adopted daughter had been dreamed up by the game designers before the production of KOF '96, and the details surrounding her origins gradually came to include a crucial role as a descendant of the Orochi tribe. Designed with the ardent love of her designers, Leona's special moves are markedly unique compared to the other characters, and reveal the particular tastes of her designers.

About Mature: She used to be Rugal's secretary. For the chief game planner at the time, it seems that both she and Vice were given the image of the 'ruthless woman' and the 'cruel woman' respectively, but when they became actual characters things got a little hectic, and someone came up with, 'Rugal had a secretary, didn't he. Make it two and run with that'. So these two characters came into being (Talk about slacking off). Consequently, they received additional characteristics: they were actually spies sent to observe Rugal and the descendants of the Orochi 8ketsu Clan.

About Vice: If Mature was the 'ruthless woman', Vice was to be the 'cruel woman'. The official illustrations for Vice and Mature remain extremely popular, and we're glad we could supply our fans with these images that cannot be reduced to pixels. The period of development for KOF '96 dragged on right up to the time of its scheduled release. At the location test for this title, Mature and Vice were still not included in the game. It's not that they were hidden, but there wasn't enough time to insert them into this initial version (we can talk about this calmly now, but at the time...forget about it!).

About Goenitz: In spite of the fact of Goenitz's sole official appearance in '96, he continues to have a considerable following of fans to this day, making him one of KOF's most popular characters. With strength that surpasses Rugal, the boss character of '94 and '95, the episode of the young Goenitz taking out the eye of Rugal was added to the game's story. Rugal, in turn, relieved Heidern of one of his eyes, which makes us think that SNK sure seems to have a lot of one-eyed characters, witness Gilbert, Jubei Yagyu, and Ramon. If you look carefully at the Goenitz the designer drew at the time (with a little help), you'll notice the shiver-inducing moment in which Goenitz appears to have six fingers.

About Geese Howard: The dream event for SNK's most recognizable characters! ...and what dream event would be complete without the appearance of Geese? Naturally, he's the character who people hope appears in the game each year, and there were plans to have him appear in KOF '95 long before. Various considerations at the time, however, led developers to abandon this plan. Then, with the time being ripe, Geese reappeared in KOF '96. Even throughout the game, this boss team received special treatment: things like leitmotif music were prepared for each member and at the time of this title's release, enthusiasm for this game reached a feverish pitch. Numerous special moves were prepared for Geese, but in view of the memory capacity and time required for adjustments, a good number of Super Special Moves had to be left out. A waste, really...

About Wolfgang Krauser: In KOF '96 the Boss Team was formed! And with that, Krauser entered the tournament, teaming up with his half brother Geese... but at the time, in terms of memory limitations and the KOF system of that time, it was a tough environment to faithfully depict the Krauser of Fatal Fury. Developers still cringe remembering the numerous criticisms, big and small, regarding the Fatal Fury Team's treatment. KOF '96 saw the debut of Krauser as a player character, but in the ending sequence he did make a cameo in KOF '94.

About Mr. BIG: For a variety of reasons, the Krauser of KOF got a bad rap, but BIG received favorable reviews from the fans. BIG is an austere villain brimming over with adult appeal-that's the character of Mr. BIG. The behavior of the women who hang with him also is based on a certain video the designers of the time often watched. The woman mutters, "He's bad", but just what does that actually mean? The truth remains a deep mystery. During the development stage, a positive slide for his Super Special Moves included one labeled "Spinning Stick Thrust, Kind of Like an Anti-Air Assault". We'd like to think that the move wasn't scrapped because of the vagueness of its name, but it's too bad the general public never got to see it. It rocks!

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '96 - PCCB-00223) on 21/08/1996.

- TRIVIA -

Bakumatsu Rouman - Gekka no Kenshi (translates from Japanese as 'Bakumatsu Romance - Swordsman In The Moonlight') was released on December 5th, 1997.

This game is known outside Japan as 'The Last Blade' and in Korea as 'The Last Soldier'.

Parts of Gekka no Kenshi was based off of the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin'.

The Bakumatsu period of Japan (1860-1899) represents the opening of Japanese ports to foreigners. The Last Blade is set during this time period and you can see Europeans in some backgrounds, as well as some European dress influences on some characters.

This game has a lot to do with Japanese religion. In what little understanding of Japanese culture, there are four gods in Japanese mythology: Seiryuu (blue dragon), Suzaku (red phoenix), Byakko (white tiger) and Genbu. Each god is associated with a direction: Byakko with west, Seiryuu with east, Genbu with north and Suzaku in the south. The four gods also seem to be portrayed in an identical manner: Suzaku is often seen as a renegade of sorts, Genbu is often wise, Byakko seems to be strong and Seiryuu seems to be the role of the protagonist. To this end, the four characters that are avatars to these gods in Gekka no Kenshi (Kaede, Okina, Shigen and Kagami) seem to fit the gods themselves to a tee (Kaede to Seiryuu, Okina to Genbu, Shigen to Byakko and Kagami to Suzaku). However, there may be one (unintentional) reference to the entire fighting game itself. These four characters may very well represent the four popular styles of characters found in nearly fighting game:
Kaede is a Shotokan-style character. This type of character, of course, is the earliest type of fighting game character (as early fighting games always had the protagonist be proficient in some form of karate). However, ever since the release of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", a Shoto-character refers to a character with similar moves to that of Ryu and Ken from that game, or more specifically, a character with a projectile and a built upper. Kaede fits this property well: his Ittou Hayate is a projectile (much like Ryu's Hadou Ken) and his Ittou Kuuga is a built upper (like Ken's Shoryuu Ken). Of course, Kaede may also be a nod to that of SNK's first fighting game protagonist (Terry Bogard) as well: his Kasshin Fukuryuu super is in the style of Terry's Power Geyser. To this day, many fighting game characters are known as Shoto characters - their simplicity can't be beat.
Shigen is a large character. Large characters come generally in two flavors: the power character and the grappler (Shigen himself is a mix of both). Power characters generally don't move much but deal lots of damage per hit. Grapplers are those whose special moves are mainly throws. These characters tend to last longer because of their size, but have a weakness that they have either short range or are slow (or, in the case of some characters, overly complicated moves).
Okina may be described as a turtler. This may seem like an inside joke (Okina, in his profile, refers to his family as a bunch of turtles), but it sometimes make sense. Jokes aside, turtlers are not exactly a type of character, but a type of player. That is, a turtler is a player who tend to block attacks a lot.
Charge characters (i.e. those whose repertoire of moves are mainly charge moves) generally fall into this category, as it is often that they need to remain in a blocking position in order to get their charges and counterattack.
Over the years, there have been many incentives to stray away from this style (as well as derivatives thereof, such as ticking), such as guard breaks, overheads, low attacks, shorter charges and unblockable moves.
Granted, the turtler is not as big as a factor as it used to be (the most popular character in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" was Guile because of his turtling and ticking abilities), but Okina's reference to turtles remains.
Kagami, of course, continues SNK's tradition of making cheap-ass characters for final bosses.

Akari and Juzoh are the comedic relief characters in the Gekka series: Juzoh is seen in Akari's stage if Akari is fighting (and obviously, if Akari is not fighting Juzoh). Likewise, Akari can be seen in Juzoh's stage if Juzoh is fighting (and if Juzoh isn't fighting against Akari).

- TRIVIA -

Released on November 25, 1998 in Japan.

The title translates from Japanese as 'Bakumatsu Romance Episode II - Swordsman of the Moonlight: On the Moon a Flower Blooming, a Petal Falling'.

This game is known outside Japan as The Last Blade 2. 

Kojiroh Sanada is a homage to an ancient Chinese legend about a girl disguising herself as her father (the same story was also used in the Disney movie Mulan).

Lee Rekka is a homage to the Cantonese hero, Wong Fei Hung.

Akari and Juzoh are the comedic relief characters in the Gekka series: If Akari is fighting someone other than Juzoh, Juzoh can be seen next to the elephant. If Akari is fighting Juzoh, Akari's three friends (Hijiri Nanase, Aoi Yahata and Shizuka Kujou) can be seen next to the elephant. If Juzoh is fighting someone other than Akari, Akari can be seen with her friends.

- UPDATES -

In the original (Japanese) version of Last Blade 2, each of the 3 modes is described by one kanji: Chikara (red), Waza (blue) and Kiwame (green). Chikara means 'strength', Waza 'skill' and Kiwame 'extreme'.
These 3 modes were made into 'Power', 'Speed' and 'EX', respectively, for their English release.
However, one case where the modes were literally translated remain.
If you look at the English 'How To Play' intro in Last Blade 2, you will see 'Strength and Skill' where they should have said 'Power and Speed'.
A slight mistake in the English renaming, or a tribute to the Japanese and therefore correct, names.

League Bowling (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods: 'Regulation', 'Flash' and 'Strike 90'.

The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.

The 'Strike 90' mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the 'Flash' game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players' scores.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu, Last Resort - PCCB-00087) on 21/05/1992.

Magical Drop III (c) 1997 Data East.

More characters, more gameplay modes, more frantic gameplay, more fun! This is what every videogame sequel should be, and the sequel to one of the best puzzle games for the Neo-Geo MVS is indeed a game not to be missed! Lots of fun for one or two players!

- TRIVIA -

Magical Drop III was released on February 25, 1997. This is Data East's final arcade video game. 

The game now features parodies of all the characters featured in the 22 cards of the major Arcana in a Tarot card deck. These are numbered from 0 to 21 as follows: 
00. Fool 
01. Magician 
02. High Priestess 
03. Emperor 
04. Empress 
05. Hierophant 
06. Lovers 
07. Chariot 
08. Strength 
09. Hermit 
10. (Wheel of) Fortune

Note that the only exception to this statement would be Black Pierrot since he does not appear in a Tarot card deck. Black Pierrot is an added bonus character to challenge really good Magical Drop 3 pros! 

Note: In puzzle and adventure modes, only 8 characters are available: Fool, High Priestess, Emperor, Lovers, Chariot, Strength, Justice and Star.

- UPDATES -

The Japanese version of this game features LOTS of stuff unavailable in any other version:

* In Challenge Mode there is a story intro at the beginning explaining the reason behind the Magical Drop competition, an extra animation showing a close-up of the Magical Drop book as it opens,  an ending for each character available in the game, a "Hard" difficulty setting, as well as a bonus fortune reading when you beat the Challenge Mode or you lose against the CPU and  refuse to continue. All of this is absent in the USA &amp; Europe versions.

* In Challenge Mode, each character has a unique set of quotes before a battle begins, this even applies in the battles against the end bosses Tower &amp; Fortune. In the USA &amp; Europe versions there are only two possible quotes before a fight for all characters:

Quote #1
CPU: Get out of my way!
Player: I'll never lose to you! 

Quote #2
CPU: You want to fight?
Player: Now let's see who is better!

* In Adventure mode, each character has its very own story intro as well as its very own ending which is different from the one seen in Challenge mode. Additionally this mode plays like a board game in which you compete against three other characters on the board, and if any of the others get to Empress' castle before your character, you will get a generic bad ending. If you arrive on a tile already occupied by a CPU-controlled character, you will have 2 options:
1) The option on the right: you don't want to trouble and ignore the opponent (sometimes you will have to back off 1 tile)
2) The option on the left: you fight the opponent. If you win, he or she will be eliminated but it would be the same for you if you fail, so be careful!
In the USA and European versions, there is no storyline and the only character on the board is controlled by the player. 

* Like in the previous game, each character has his/her own unique voice. The European version features less voice tracks and the USA version features a single voice track for all characters.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Father Strength: At the character select screen, highlight Strength, hold C and press A or B. This trick does not work nor in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode. 

* Play with bonus characters: At the character select screen, highlight any character (Except World, World's number is 21 so she can't be used for this trick) and wait until the timer counts down to the number assigned to that character: 
00 - Fool 
01 - Magician 
02 - High Priestess 
03 - Empress 
04 - Emperor 
05 - Hierophant 
06 - Lovers 
07 - Chariot 
08 - Strength 
11 - Justice 
13 - Death 
15 - Devil 
17 - Star 
19 - Sun 
20 - Judgment 
Then push C only three times. Moon, Hanged Man, Hermit, Temperance, Tower and Fortune will appear and will now be selectable. This trick does neither work in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode. 

* Secret Stages: 
1) Moon (after Level 6): Finish the sixth stage without exceeding 90 seconds since the beginning. 
2) Hanged Man (after Level 6): Finish the sixth stage exceeding 300 seconds since the beginning. 
3) Black Pierrot (after Level 10): Finish the tenth stage with at least 150000 points.

Magician Lord (c) 1990 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.

Magician Lord is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which players take on the roll of a wizard called Elta - the last Magician Lord - on his quest to save his homeland from the evil Gul-Agieze, who plans to resurrect the God of Destruction using 8 tomes of mystical power.

Elta has to jump, shoot and climb his way to the end of each of the game's 8 levels where he must beat a servant of Gal, along with one of Gal's sinister boss creations. To complete the game Elta must reach the final stage and defeat Az Atorse himself. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, Elta will be harassed by an invincible monster.

Elta's primary form of attack is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that can fired in one of four directions, but by collecting the special colored orbs that occasionally appear, he can transform into a different form, making him more powerful and giving him new attacks.

These are the six different forms that Elta can assume by picking up the colored orbs:

* Dragon Warrior: In this form Elta attacks by breathing fire; a continuous short-range attack that, unlike the standard attack, can also be aimed diagonally.

* Waterman: The Waterman-form attacks with water grenades – blue bubbles of water that burst upon touching the ground and form into water pillars. The attack can hit several times for additional damage but only covers a small area.

* Poseidon: A more powerful version of the Waterman, Poseidon shoots wide waves of water that travel along the ground for several hits. It does severe damage and causes enemies to freeze and shatter on impact. While very powerful, this form moves very slowly.

* Shinobi: The Shinobi-form gains increased agility and attacks with powerful magical arcs of fire which are wide but slow-moving.

* Samurai: While limited in range, the Samurai-form is the only form that can attack through walls, shields or even multiple enemies, using a boomerang-like energy attack that does heavy damage.

* Raijin: The Raijin-form gives Elta's jumping ability a big boost as well as a unique attack that creates a continuous electrical field around his body.

- TRIVIA -

The project design (kukakusho) debuted in 1989 and the development started first semester of 1989. A beta version was location tested in January 1990 in Japan, this version had longer stages and this was not adapted for an arcade play (a game was too long). So, developers taked the decision to smaller all stages but cutting them off for the final version.

This is the first Alpha Denshi game for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware and it was the first game which used the capabilities of the hardware (dezooming, rotate).

27 player's transforms were planned but only six were finalized due to gameplay changes.

Magician Lord MVS was released in June 1990 in Japan. At this time, this game was the Killer application for Neo-Geo, all reviews from magazines were very positive, many people wanted it and bought it.

		<name>Major Havoc</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 39 years ago:

Major Havoc (c) 1983 Atari.

Major Havoc is a vector-based shoot-em-up and platform game in which the evil Vaxxian Empire overran the galaxy many years ago. Most of humanity was enslaved and abducted to the Vaxxian home world, although a few human scientists managed to escape. The Vaxxian Empire has long since collapsed but numerous Vaxxian space stations, all blindly controlled and defended by robots, still remain in the galaxy, mindlessly following their original, pre-programmed orders.

The small band of scientists who initially escaped have cloned the great human hero, 'Major Havoc' and tasked him with flying his 'Catastrofighter' through a wormhole in space so that he may lead a clone army against the dreaded Vaxxian robots and to liberate the remnants of humanity by destroying the enemy reactors. The player controls Major Rex Havoc, the leader of this band of clones.

The game is broken down into two distinct gameplay genres. The first is a shoot-'em-up in which the player controls Major Havoc's spaceship against the numerous robot ships that defend the enemy reactors. The ships are encased in a force-field shield which must first be shot and depleted before the ship itself can be destroyed. 

The second section is a platform/maze game in which the player - after first landing on the space-station by centering their ship between a moving white line - enters the station. The object here is to reach the core of the station and sabotage its reactor by setting an explosive charge. Once the charge has been set, the player must quickly escape back to their ship and and reach a minimum safe distance before the space-station explodes. 

The Space-station has reduced gravity, making Major Havoc react slowly to players' input. Each station has a maze-like layout and red arrows guide the player towards the station's core. Once the charge has been placed, more arrows guide the player to the station's exit. The mazes of successive space-stations become more complex and harder to navigate as the player progresses. Players also have a limited amount of oxygen in a station but more can be collected by running over the 'O2' symbols scattered throughout the maze.

Major Havoc features a warp system that allows players to skip levels and gain bonus points or extra lives. The warps are activated by a utilizing a Breakout-style mini-game at the bottom-right corner of the screen. 

The mini-game is available at the start of each wave and the way it works is this: a two or three-digit number is displayed and players must move the controller until the number matches the one required to warp. For example, the RED WARP requires the number '23', so the player must move the controller left or right until the first digit matches '2', then must press the fire button. The Breakout game begins and must be played while moving the joystick to the '3'. Once players have successfully entered the warp code, they are transported to a higher level.

- TRIVIA -

Major Havoc was released in November 1983.

New Features: 
* High-Tech Game Cabinet: A new video arcade game cabinet design delivers high visibility and increased player attraction.
* Roller Control: The backlit roller control provides left-to-right and right-to-left directional movement.
* Multi-Layer Printed-Circuit Board: This state-of-the art design printed-circuit board (PCB) provides low system noise with high system reliability.
* Game Within a Game: Action occurs in the lower right corner of the TACTICAL SCAN. Breakout can be played for a few seconds before the actual Major Havoc game play starts. Earn a bonus life here!
* Dual FIRE/JUMP Button: This dual-action button allows Major Havoc to jump in the maze sequence and to fire at enemy robots in the space wave.
* Add-A-Coin: This feature permits you to start a new Major Havoc game at the level where you last saw the TACTICAL SCAN in your previous game play.
* Secret Warp Code: The code feature rewards you for short game times as it advances to deep levels in game play. Use the roller control to dial in secret code numbers during the TACTICAL-SCAN wave.

Gameplay innovation at its finest. A game that would have done greater numbers had anyone cared in 1984. Only 300 dedicated machines were manufactured. Original price was $2,095. If Owen had done Major Havoc in a raster version, which was suggested, it would have sold 10 times as many. But unfortunately... the operators were getting very angry at vector games for failing all the time.

Mark Cerny came in the middle of the design, adding one of the space waves (the flying fish) and the last four base ship mazes. He also added some objects to the mazes (such as the gun and floating boots) and helped clean up old items that never got shipped.

The original name for the game was "Tollian Web", from the Star Trek episode The Tholian Web - an episode that also provided the inspiration for the unreleased "Ms. Gorf". Later titles included "Alpha One" and "Major Rex Havoc" (which was dropped when Atari discovered an underground comic with a similar name).

Ettore Ciaffi holds the official record for this game with 1,940,078 points.

A hack of this game is called "Major Havoc Return to Vax".

A Major Havoc unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Warp Codes: It's possible to warp to higher levels in Major Havoc from the start of the game by using certain codes. This is useful to not only be able to get through the game more quickly, but each warp also gives a fairly hefty bonus for carrying it out. This is done by playing the mini-Breakout game at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen when the game starts. The game will have a phrase such as, 'Enter Red Warp 00' at the bottom of the screen. What you do is use the controls to 'dial in' the first digit of the appropriate code given below, then press the Fire button to serve the ball and repeat as necessary. The codes are:
Red code - 23, 250,000 points, Level 4.
Yellow code - 46, 600,000 points, Level 9.
Green code - 824, 700,000 points, Level 10.
Aqua code - 315, 950,000 points, Level 13.

Note that you can only enter the codes in the order they're given - it's not possible to enter, say, the red warp code followed directly by the aqua warp code.

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 22 years ago:

Metal Slug 3 (c) 2000 SNK.

The heroes of the first 2 games return once more to do battle with the ever-present General Morden and his vast army. The third game of the series places a greater emphasis on defeating hulking boss characters than the 2 previous outings. Metal Slug 3 also introduced multiple routes through most levels, vastly increasing the replay value of the game. For example; on the first level the player reaches a point where they can either continue over land, or enter a small submarine and head down into the ocean depths, where they will be faced with a variety of huge, deadly sea-dwelling creatures.

Metal Slug 3 introduced a number of new elements that have a direct effect on the player's character - similar to the 'mummification' of the second game. The first of these is the 'fatty' affect: should the player pick up too much food (fish, for example) their character will morph in an obese version of itself. This doesn't have any detrimental effect on performance and is included purely for reasons of humour. Another effect is the now infamous 'Zombiefication'; should the player's character be attacked by a Zombie, he or she will become Zombie until they are either killed, or pick up a first-aid, which will restore the player's character back to human form. Movement while in the zombie state is slow and restricted but the player is armed with what can perhaps be best described as the 'Zombie Vomit'; a huge arc of blood that can be used to destroy oncoming enemies. A second Zombie attack while the player's character is in a Zombie state will result in the player losing a life.

- TRIVIA -

Metal Slug 3 was released in May 2000. This game was the last game in the Metal Slug series developed by SNK. The underwater stages are a graphical nod to Irem's 1993 classic, "In the Hunt". This is understandable as many of SNK's Metal Slug developers originally worked for Irem.

Metal Slug 3 features a number of sci-fi movie homages: Mission 2 features a guest appearance by the Men in Black. The carnivorous plant aliens in Mission 4 are a parody of the sci-fi musical comedy, 'The Little Shop of Horrors'. The squid-like aliens in the gigantic Mission 5 (known as 'Mars People') are a homage to the movie, 'Independence Day'. Also, the alien clones you face in this stage seem to parody the sci-fi movie clasic, 'Invasion of the body snatchers'. Finally, the last boss battle seems to be slightly inspired by the ending sequence in the sci-fi horror movie, 'Alien Resurrection'. One of the hostages (who also appeared in "Metal Slug 2" &amp; "Metal Slug X", by the way) known as Hyakkutaro will join the fight by shooting fireballs.

Noise Factory released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Metal Slug 3 Original Soundtrack - NF-0002) on 31/01/2003.

A hack of this game was released in 2005 as "Metal Slug 6 [Hack]", one year before the official "Metal Slug 6".

NAM-1975 (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

NAM-1975 is a war themed shoot-em-up set during the final months of the Vietnam war and offers one or simultaneous two-player gameplay. The story begins with the two soldiers called Silver and Brown entering the war to rescue Dr. R. Muckly, an ex-scientist of the US Army who has been kidnapped by the 'Northside Terrorists'. Dr. Muckly's daughter, Nancy, has also been kidnapped and is presumed imprisoned.

As the game progresses it's revealed that Dr. Muckly is a madman who is building a gigantic laser cannon with which to take over the world, players must fight through enemy-packed stages to reach and defeat the evil scientist. The game is an into-the-screen shoot-em-up with the action viewed from a third-person perspective. Players can move left and right, as well as run and somersault to avoid the incoming enemy fire. 

Players are initially armed with only a standard infinite-ammo machine gun and ten grenades. When certain enemies are killed, however, they drop more powerful guns or grenades that can be collected and used by the players. Weapons that can be picked up are:

* Balcan (A more powerful machine gun)
* Flamethrower (for taking out ground units only)
* Missile Launcher. 
* Grenades
* Spark Bomb
* Napalm Bomb.

Occasionally, an enemy soldier will appear holding a hostage. If players kill the soldier and save the hostage, the hostage joins the player and shoots at enemies until either the player is killed or reaches the end of the stage.

The final battle against Dr. Muckly does not allow continues and if players lose all of their lives during the battle, the game is over.

NAM-1975 was released on April 26 1990 in Japan.

This is the first game developed for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware

One of NAM-1975's influences was the 1987 Stanley Kubrick film, Full Metal Jacket. There are even some scenes which mirror the film such as the screaming soldier in the intro with the 'Born To Kill' helmet, and a Vietnamese lady with an AK-47 (which is seen near the end of the movie).

NAM-1975 was a blatant plagiarism of TAD Corp's "Cabal", released in September 1988.

Out Run (c) 1986 Sega Enterprises, Limited.

Out Run is a ground-breaking racing game in which the player drives a red Ferrari Testarossa through a number of colourful European locations, trying to reach each end-of-level checkpoint before the tight time limit expires.

Each of the game's stages is packed with civilian traffic that must be carefully avoided, as players try to negotiate the game's twisting, hilly roads. 

At the end of every stage players are presented with a fork in the road, allowing them to chose which route they wish to take next. This was not the first time this feature had appeared (Tatsumi's 1983 racer, TX-1, was the first to introduce forked roads).

As well as being able to choose routes, players could also - via the game's "in-car radio" - choose one of three different catchy tunes to listen to while driving. The songs are 'Magical Sound Shower', 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'.

- TRIVIA -

Released internationally on September 20, 1986.

Also released as:
"Out Run [Deluxe Type]".

At the end of each stage, before the end-of-stage goal is reached, players are presented with a fork in the road; a unique innovation that, for the first time in the history of racing games, gave players a choice of which route they wished to take through the game. Out Run's game-play was both tight and instinctive and, together with the superb stage design and wonderfully realized sprite-scaled graphics, would completely revolutionize not just racing games, but arcade games in general.

Out Run is still regarded as perhaps the finest arcade racer (and certainly the finest sprite-driven racer) of all time. This was especially true of the deluxe cabinet version, which featured a fully hydraulic tilting cabinet (resembling a red Ferrari Testarossa) and a powerful speaker system situated directly behind the player's head. The sublime music still captivates many fans today, although the sublime 'Magical Sound Shower' is generally regarded as the finest of the three in-game tunes on offer (the others being 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'). The final tune, 'Last Wave', is only played when the high-score table is displayed.

At least part of Out Run's huge success was down to it capturing the fun-yet-superficial spirit of the 1980s. Previous racing games had concentrated on the more serious side of racing, with the action usually taking place in a Formula One racing car, over a series of competent but uninspiring racing tracks. Out Run was different; in a decade that celebrated style over content, the game offered players the ultimate boy racer experience by putting them behind the wheel of that eighties icon of cool, a red Ferrari Testarossa; replete with a 'blonde bimbo' in the passenger seat.

Sega didn't actually have (nor indeed ask for) permission from Ferrari to use one of their cars for the game. This inevitably led to a degree of bad feeling and threats of litigation between the two companies. They have since settled their differences, however, as Sega acquired an official license to use the Ferrari range in its 2003 sequel, "Out Run 2".

Opponent cars list:
* 1972 Volkswagen Beetle
* 1971 Chevrolet Corvette
* 1985 Porsche Carrera 911 Turbo
* 1985 BMW 325i Cabriolet E30
* Lorry

Out Run contains in-game billboards advertising KTM motorcycles.

Richard Jackson holds the official record for this game with 52,897,690 points.

In the film 'Donnie Darko', Donnie is playing Out Run at an arcade with his girlfriend. The scene shows him crashing his car during their discussion.

An Out Run cabinet can be seen in the 1988 educational video presented by General Motors called 'The Game Of Your Life'.

A MTV public announcement against drunk driving shown in the mid '90s shows a gamer in their viewpoint playing Out Run whilst under the influence of alcohol and cuts to each point where the gamer crashes until the end of game.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Fastest route: the fastest route for finishing the game is Right (Devil's Canyon), Left (Snowy Alps), Right (Wheatfield), Right (Autobahn).

* Secret credit message: right before the road forks, press and hold Start. When you choose one of the roads and the other one disappears from view, a secret credit message will come up on the screen.

* Instead of just pressing the accelerator all the way when you're about to start, you should instead try to keep the gas in 'the high greens' and just below red. The exact moment the green light goes on you should give it as much gas as possible thereby starting up much faster. Instead of shifting at approx. 170mph you should change gears at about 120 mph to avoid slowdown. This hint earns you approx. 1 second. This trick works every time you have to start from 0 mph but is difficult to time right when you don't have the green light for timing.

* The second before going off road you can change very quickly to low gear and then high gear again. If done correctly you can drive off the road without any slowdown for about 1-2 seconds. If you time it right you can actually change to low then high again after the 1-2 seconds and not loose ANY speed whatsoever when driving offroad. This way you can keep going 292mph even though you're offroad.

Puzzle Bobble 2 (c) 1995 Taito.

Puzzle Bobble 2 is an arcade puzzle game offering one or two-player competitive play and is the first sequel to the hugely successful original. 

As with the first game, the aim is to clear each play area of the coloured bubbles clustered in the upper half of the screen. This is achieved by firing bubbles up the screen - with the angle of trajectory dictated by the player - at the clusters of bubbles. The aim is to forms chains of three or more like-coloured bubbles, making them disappear. 

At regular intervals the 'ceiling' of the play area - together with any bubbles stuck to it - will drop one row down the screen, decreasing the size of the play area making life more difficult for players. The game is over when the bubbles reach the very bottom of the play area.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the "Taito F3 System" Hardware.

Prom Stickers: E10

Players: 4
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 4

- TRIVIA -

Puzzle Bobble 2 was released in July 1995.

This game is known in United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil as "Bust-A-Move Again".

This game runs on the Taito F3 System hardware but it was re-released (licensed to SNK) on the SNK Neo-geo MVS hardware in 1999 as "Puzzle Bobble 2 [MVS]".

If you look closely at the bubbles, you'll notice that the enemies from "Bubble Bobble" are trapped inside; a different enemy for each different colored bubble. The following chart shows which enemies are trapped in which color bubble:
Legend: Color of Bubble =&gt; "Bubble Bobble" Enemy Inside
Blue =&gt; Zen-Chan
Yellow =&gt; Pulpul
Red =&gt; Invader
Green =&gt; Drunk
Purple =&gt; Monsta
Orange =&gt; Banebou
Black =&gt; Hidegonsu
White =&gt; Mighta

On the last level, you will see characters from "Bubble Bobble" &amp; "Rainbow Islands".

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'AAA'.

Stepehn Krogman holds the official records for this game with 75275450 points (factory setting).

Zuntata Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Puzzle Bobble Variety - ZTTL-0009) on March 28, 1997.

- SCORING -

Pop a bubble: 10 points.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 42 years ago:

Phoenix (c) 1980 Amstar.

Phoenix is a classic vertical shoot-em-up in the mould of Taito's "Space Invaders" and Namco's "Galaxian", but takes the concept further with the introduction of progressive stages of play (instead of simply repeating a single playfield over and over with an increasing difficulty level). 

The player pilots a lone ship that can only move left and right along the botton of the playfield and fire upwards. The ship can also utilize a temporary 'Force Field' to protect it from missiles and birds. Any birds that that collide with the Force Field are destroyed. The Force Field only lasts for two seconds, but then cannot be used again for another five seconds. 

There are five attack waves to each round of play. 

The first wave begins with a formation of sixteen birds attacking the player's ship. They drop missiles and dive at the ship in an effort to destroy it. 

The second wave is a variation of the first, only with a different enemy attack pattern. 

The third wave begins with pattern of eight eggs that hatch into blue Phoenix birds that then attack the player's ship. These birds can be destroyed by rocket fire from the ship. If the rocket hits the bird on center, the bird is destroyed. If the rocket hits the bird to the left or right of center, only that wing of the bird is destroyed. The wing will regenerate itself if the bird is not quickly destroyed. 

The fourth wave is similar to the third, only with two banks of eggs instead of one. 

The fifth and final wave is the attack of the Space fortress mothership; a huge mothership piloted by a purple-coloured Alien Queen who sends down waves of small birds to attack the player's ship, as well as launching missiles from the mothership itself. The Alien Queen is protected by a barrier that must be shot several times before both the Queen and the mothership are destroyed.

Once the mothership has been destroyed, the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.

The additional gameplay elements seem to be at the expense of hardware performance. Despite having more basic graphics than "Galaxian", Phoenix's ships move in a very mechanical fashion compared to the smooth, nicely animated movements of Namco's classic.

- TECHNICAL -

Most Phoenix games will be in a standard Centuri woodgrain cabinet, but several other cabinets exist, due to this game being sold by multiple companies at the same time. These use sticker sideart (which covers the upper half of the machine), and glass marquees. The control panel is made up entirely of buttons, no joysticks are present (on the upright and 'maxi' cabs, that is; the cocktail cab has a 2-way joystick and 2 buttons). The monitor in this machine is mounted vertically, and the monitor bezel is relatively unadorned. Phoenix uses a unique wiring harness, which isn't know to be compatible with any other games.

- TRIVIA -

Titlescreen's copyright notice:
PHOENIX COPYRIGHT 1980
AMSTAR ELECTRONICS CORP.
PHOENIX AZ. U.S.A.

Phoenix was released in December 1980.

Phoenix was the first multi-level space shooter and also the first shooter to include bosses. Despite its hardware issues, Phoenix's many gameplay innovations ensured that it now is rightly regarded as a classic and, along with Taito's "Space Invaders" and Namco's "Pac-Man" shares the dubious honour of being one of the most cloned games of the 1980s; with numerous console and home computer 'tributes' appearing.

The song that is played at the start of the game is 'Romance de Amor', also known as 'Spanish Romance', whose true author is currently unknown.

The song that is played when you start over after the mothership is destroyed is Ludwig van Beethoven's 'Für Elise'.

Mark Gotfraind holds the official record for this game with 987,620 points.

- SCORING -

Scoring is a little complicated in this game due to the fact it depends on hits made and how close the Phoenix's are to your fighter.

Phoenix fighters: 20, 40, or 80 points; 200 points if flying as a bird.
Phoenix birds: 50 or 100 points/egg, 100 - 800 points/bird (depends on how many wings shot off and distance from fighter).
Mothership: 1,000 - 9,000 points (may depend on how close the mothership is to you fighter when you kill the Alien Queen; may also depend on the amount of damage to the mothership, speed of destruction, as well as the number of spaceships destroyed). Usually, first 9 spaceships would increase by a thousand, then will be followed by nine 9000 point spaceships, then back to the first nine set, etc...

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle at the bottom of the screen. You will see a formation of enemy fighters at the top of the screen. This is the beginning of Wave 1. A quick note about the Force Field: it lasts a couple of seconds and takes about five seconds to regenerate again.

WAVES 1 AND 2:
1) You will usually be attacked by multiple fighters at any one time. The movements of these fighters is pretty random.
2) In addition to dropping bombs on your fighter, Phoenix fighters also tend to try to ram your fighter.
3) After you clear out a few fighters, they will reassemble at the top of the screen. They will then move in synch with each other as they creep to the bottom of the screen.
4) Sometimes a Phoenix fighter will hover right above your ship. If you're quick, you can get off a quick shot and move away before a bomb can be dropped on you.
5) If multiple Phoenix fighters are at your level, use the Force Field to clear a path through them.

WAVE 3 AND 4:
1) The Phoenixes in Wave 3 enter the screen in a zig-zag pattern while the Phoenixes in Wave 4 arrive in a cross-over pattern of four Phoenixes per side.
2) Once they get large, they start to do erratic zig-zag patterns across the screen. At the same time, they are dropping bombs toward your fighter. Your goal is to shoot off their wings. If you do this, it forces them to go straight down until the wing regenerates. They will still be dropping bombs, but at least they will be going straight down.
3) If at all possible, try to hit the Phoenixes when they are close to your ship. Doing this gets you more points.
4) In addition, try to shoot off both wings before destroying a Phoenix for more points.

WAVE 5:
1) Your goal on this wave is to cut through the mothership's hull and shield and take out the Alien Queen inside.
2) Start firing as rapidly as you can to quickly cut through the hull. It will take quite a few shots to get to the shield.
3) The shield rotates so you will have to hit it a lot of times in order to get a wide enough hole in it to hit the Alien Queen.
4) As all of this is going on, the mothership is continually descending upon your ship. In addition, the escorts are constantly harassing you.
5) A good strategy is that once you have cut a path through the hull and shield, wait for the mothership to be almost on top of your ship. When you take out the alien, you will get a lot more points.
6) Destroying the escorts does not end this wave. Once you complete Wave 5, the cycle begins anew.

* During the game three birds will attack all in a line. Let those birds fly all the way to the bottom and start to fly back up. As they are flying up, shoot all three in a row real quick (2 or 3 seconds) and you will elevate your score to 204,000 regardless of what your current score is - The best way to get this bonus for shooting the three birds in a line is on the second stage of level 2. The blue and pink birds in an oval shape. Just wait, not firing at the bottom of the screen. A single bird will come down, fanny around and then fly back up, then four birds will fly down together in a line. When they start to fly back up - blast three of them for the bonus. It works best here because of the rapid fire allowed on this and every other 2nd stage. In addition, accomplishing the trick a second time again puts your score at 204,000, even if your score was higher.

- UPDATES -

MVS (Arcade) vs. AES (Neo-Geo) differences:
On the AES (Neo-Geo) Geese is a playable character by imputing a code. On the MVS (Arcade) version he was removed as a playable character for being too strong.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Shadow/EX Fighter: Shadow/EX fighter is an evil version of the selected character with a different move-list set as well as a different ending than his/her original counterpart. This code only works with the following characters: Andy Bogard, Billy Kane, Blue Mary, Tung Fu Rue.
1) At the character selection screen, highlight the character of your choice, hold Start and press B(x2), C(x2).
2) While continuing to hold Start, hold B, pause one second and hold C.
3) While continuing to hold Start+B+C, press A or D to select the Shadow version of the character.
4) Pressing A or D will select a different color.

* Fight against Geese Howard: Begin game play in single player mode, win all rounds, do not score less than a 'B' rank in any battle and get more than 750,000 points befire fighting Wolfgang Krauser. You will fight Geese Howard in a special 'Nightmare' match.

* You can see different sets of funny outtakes during the credits if you consecutively beat the game 5 or 6 times before they start to repeat themselves.

Robo Army (c) 1991 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku]. 

Robo Army is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players who take on the roles of two cybernetically-enhanced soldiers called Rocky and Maxima and must attempt to stop am invading cyber army called 'Hell Jeed' from enslaving the human race.

The game uses three buttons: 
A - Attack
B - Jump
C - Energy blast

Hitting the jump and attack button simultaneously lets Rocky and Maxima attack behind them. Collecting energy balls makes the energy blast more powerful, similar to the magic potions in Sega's "Golden Axe". One major difference, however, is that the special attack here can be used several times to diminishing effect before it finally runs out.

Players can often pick up a fallen robot's limb to club other robots to death with. Also, if players approach a weakened enemy and press forward and the A button at the right time, Maxima or Rocky will rip the enemy in half.

Finally, a defeated enemy will occasionally drop a glowing icon of a human fist. Picking this up causes Rocky or Maxima to bend over and transform into a futuristic buggy-like vehicle. Any enemies Maxima and Rocky touch while in buggy form instantly explode while hitting the attack button allows them to speed across the screen to quickly run enemies down. The buggy only lasts for a limited time, however.

- TRIVIA -

Samurai Spirits was released in July 1993 in Japan.

The game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown'

Samurai Spirits is the first game that introduced weapon fighting into the fighting game genre. The game used an upgraded version of the scaling graphics engine that was originally featured in "Art of Fighting".

Samurai Spirits also started SNK's reputation for their unique style of Engrish, known as SNKgrish in their games.

Unlike "Mortal Kombat", the usage of blood in this game is generally accepted, and the decision to replace blood with 'white blood' remains a sore point among fans of this series.

Samurai Spirits is considered by some to portray Japanese culture and language effectively. Unlike most American versions of Japanese video games, the characters in this game (including the announcer) generally speak fluent Japanese with subtitles, and traditional Japanese music is often heard during gameplay. Samurai Shodown takes most of its characters from either historical sources or characters from the Ninja Scroll anime. In fact, a few designers that worked on Samurai Shodown also worked on the Ninja Scroll anime...

Haohmaru is based on the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645), whose fighting philosophy heavily influenced that of the Haohmaru character.

Ukyo Tachibana is Based on Sasaki Kojiro Genryu (1572-1612), Musashi's skilled rival.

Jubei Yagyu is based on the historical Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi (1606-1644), who was a sword instructor to the Tokugawa shogunate. The Yagyu clan was a famous clan of samurai.

Hattori Hanzo Masashige (1541-1596) was the most famous of the Iga Ninja clan. He was a genius at leading night raids on forts and fiefs and became a feared assassin. Under his leadership, Iga Ninja became so notorious that Nobunaga felt it necessary to obliterate the Iga Ninja clan.

Wan-Fu seems to be a combination of two famous Chinese warriors. The first is a famous Chinese swordsman who was a rebel during the Ch'ing Dynasty. His name was Wang Ts-bin Wu, but he became known as Da Dao Wang Wu ('Big Scimitar Wang Wu'). The second lead bases Wan Fu upon the ancient, almost legendary, founder of the Chou Dynasty, King Wu Wang.

Kyoshiro Senryo is based on Nemuri Kyoshiro, a fictional character created by Shibata Tosaburo. 'Kyoshiro' translates to something like 'deranged fellow'. Tosaburo's Kyoshiro had nothing to do with kabuki theater as does Samurai Shodown Kyoshiro. Kyoshiro's weapon is called a naginata.

Charlotte is based on a character in the manga 'The Rose of Versailles' by Riyoko Ikeda (1972).

Gen-an Shiranui looks much like Mushizo, the hunchback demon of Ninja Scroll. Gen-an's weapon is modeled after the weapon wielded by Shijima, the shadow demon, from Ninja Scroll. Although they share a surname, Gen-an is not a relative of Mai Shiranui of the Fatal Fury/King of Fighters series.

Amakusa Shiro Tokisada (1622-1638) led a Christian uprising against the Tokugawa shogunate in the Shimabara region of Japan.

Nakoruru is a homage to Sailor Moon.

A 'Kuroko' is a traditional Kabuki theater stagehand. They are traditionally dressed in black and took care of scenery and other behind-the-scenes needs during a Kabuki performance, just like modern theater stagehands. In the case of Samurai Shodown, Kuroko is the referee for each match in Samurai Shodown I and II. The black strip of fabric hanging over a Kuroko's face is to signify that they are not part of the Kabuki performance, just helping with the props. The red and white flags that Kuroko has are used in traditional martial arts matches, where each successful hit gets the corresponding fighter's flag raised.

Mai Shiranui (of Fatal Fury) appears in Haohmaru's and Gen-An's endings.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Samurai Spirits - PCCB-00135) on 17/09/1993.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Alternate Costume Colors: Highlight a fighter at the character selection screen and press D.

* Sleeping Mamahaha: This is just hilarious! To see this while playing as Nakoruru simply stand still, after a 8 secs or so Mamahaha will land on Nakoruru's shoulder, start yawning and then it will fall asleep!

* Poppy's Puppies: To see a truly cool &amp; funny secret pose with Galford, Get a PERFECT against an opponent while unarmed. You must finish the battle with anything except a throw though!

* Tam Tam's Broken Ending: If you use continues while beating the game with Tam Tam, you will miss a part of the whole ending (You can't see his real face). Beat the game with one credit in order to see his face.

* Wan-fu's Sword Explosion Bug: While playing as Wan-fu trap an enemy against the edge of the screen then perform the Explosive Sword Drop with the B button (HCB + B) to throw the sword and land next to the opponent. Since most players as well as the CPU are likely to block the move, crouch and hit them with the C button (a short kick). This will make the move unblockable and causes tons of damage!

* Cut-proof Characters?: Sometimes a finishing slash will cut most opponents in half, however some characters (these being Kyoshiro &amp; Amakusa) cannot be cut in half!

真 SAMURAI SPIRITS 覇王丸地獄変 (c) 1994 SNK Corporation.
(Shin Samurai Spirits - Haohmaru Jigoku Hen)

Shin Samurai Spirits is a one-on-one fighting game featuring 15 weapon-wielding combatants, fighting to earn the right to face the game's powerful and difficult end boss.

Building upon the success of the first game, SNK added several new characters and more moves. This is particularly evident in the addition of the POW meter, which acts as a super special-move meter. These moves not only cause severe damage to opponents but also break their weapons, forcing them to fight unarmed for a short time before a replacement weapon is issued.

Gameplay was further expanded to include several new movement options, including the ability to roll forwards and backwards, to duck to avoid high attacks, or to do small hops to avoid low strikes. This was also the first game to incorporate an offensive blocking technique, or 'parry'. Via a command issued at the last second, players can deflect an incoming attack and leave their adversary open to counter-attack. 

Shin Samurai Spirits featured cameo appearances from other SNK characters, as well as a hidden boss who would occasionally come out to challenge players.

- TRIVIA -

Shin Samurai Spirits was released in October 1994.

The title of the game translates from Japanese as 'True Samurai Spirits - Haohmaru's Incident In Hell'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown II'.

Kafuin Nicotine (Anglicized as 'Caffiene') is based somewhat on the Ninja Scroll character Dakuan who shares outfit and is armed with similar weapons. The 'papers' that Nicotine throws are called 'o-fuda', which are talismans inscribed with a prayer to endow them with certain powers. Japanese occultism and lore at work.

Neinhalt Sieger's name translates from German as 'non-stop victory'.

Genjuro Kibagami is a huge reference to a Japanese hanafuda deck. Hanafuda is a Japanese card game in which all cards represent a certain flower and time of the year. The hanafuda cards can be seen when Genjuro hits his opponent with special moves. Among the cards seen are wistaria, maple and peony. All cards shown are from an actual hanafuda deck.

Ryuhaku Todo (of AOF) appears in Gen-An's ending.

If you wait a long time, Hikyaku will throw food and/or bombs to the screen. Every so often, Kim Kaphwan (of Fatal Fury) will come out instead.

Kuroko's moves are largely borrowed from other characters.

- TRIVIA -

Samurai Spirits - Zankurou Musouken was released in October 1995 in Japan. Literally 'Samurai Spirits - Zankuro's Matchless Sword'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown III' and in Korea as "Fighters Swords". The full US name for the game is "Samurai Shodown III - Blades of Blood".

Kafuin Gaira is a Buddhist monk whose weapons are giant 'mala', or Buddhist prayer beads. When Gaira wins the first round of a match, he throws a few punches and says 'Tenchu!', which means 'retribution!'. Gaira says a traditional Buddhist prayer for his fallen opponent when he wins the final round of the match. 'Namu amida butsu', Gaira's prayer, is basically 'go to heaven' or 'rest in peace'.

Shizumaru Hisame is a homage to Himura Kenshin (a character from the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin').

Zankuro Minazuki is a homage to Raijyuta Isurugi (another character from 'Rurouni Kenshin').

Samurai Shodown IV - Amakusa's Revenge (c) 1996 SNK.

The 4th installment of the weapons-based one-on-one fighting series features seventeen selectable characters and two end bosses. Changes to the established formula include the removal of both aerial blocking and the switch-around move (the latter of which which allowed a player to move quickly behind their opponent's back). Dodges, which allowed players to evade/side-step attacks are also gone.

Players can no longer charge up their own POW gauge but a new move called the 'CD combo' was added; players can press the C and D buttons together, triggering a strike that can be followed up by a sequence of button taps.

SNK also added a "suicide" move, allowing a player to forfeit a round. The advantage to this is that the one committing suicide will start the next round with a full "POW" gauge. Certain finishes also enable a "fatality" move in the vein of "Mortal Kombat".

Some of the series' older characters were restored for the 4th game, including Charlotte, Tam Tam and Jubei Yagyu. The entire cast of the previous game also returns, although some have been redrawn to further enhance the cartoonish look.

Joining the cast are the two ninja brothers:

* Kazuki Kazama - member of the Kazama ninja clan specializing in fire jutsu, he deserts to rescue his younger sister, Hazuki, from Amakusa's clutches.
    
* Sogetsu Kazama - older brother to Kazuki and Hazuki who uses water jutsu; unlike Kazuki, he stays with the clan and is ordered to assassinate his brother for leaving.

- TRIVIA -

Samurai Spirits - Amakusa Kourin (translates from Japanese as 'Samurai Spirits - Amakusa's Descent') was released in October 1996 in Japan.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown IV - Amakusa's Revenge'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Beat the entire game in the time limit to see a picture of Wan-Fu or Sieger after the end credits. Who appears is entirely at random though.

* In order to see a special win pose with the puppies, win with a double
perfect using Slash Galford. Galford will say, 'Arigato!' as the puppies
scamper across the screen.

* I'm Not Afraid Of You!: think you are really good? Tap START 3 times quickly to make your character drop his/her sword. Now show your opponents that the most fearsome weapons are the ones you were born with! Note: a few characters are really hampered by the loss of weapon (e.g. Haohmaru, Kazuki, Sogetsu) and a few are not really affected (Nakoruru, Rimururu, Hanzo).

* Sepukku (Suicide): press Back, then move your joystick a quarter circle from forwards to down and press START to make your character kill himself/herself and lose the current round (Useless trick? Not quite since you will start the next round with a full rage gauge!).

* Silly Name Trick: now this is weird! At the naming screen input 'AAA' as your name to make your character faint!

風雲黙示録 格闘創世 (c) 1995 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].
(Fu'un Mokushiroku - Kakutou Sousei)

10 fighters, each brandishing a weapon, fight to have a crack at the Real King Leo. There are 2 planes of action to switch from and in some cases the player can use elements of the background as weapons.

- TRIVIA -

Fu'un Mokushiroku was released on April 25, 1995 in Japan. The game was known outside Japan as Savage Reign (released one month later, on May 25, 1995).

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Wind and Cloud Apocalypse - Hand-to-Hand Fighting Genesis'). 'Mokushiroku' is Japanese for the Christian book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse. 'Sousei' is Japanese for 'creation of the world', or 'genesis'. 'Sousei' and 'Mokushiroku' are diametrically opposed, just like 'Genesis' and 'Apocalypse' - and used here as a metaphor for the conflict between Syo Hayate and Shishi-Oh (King Lion).

'Fu'un' in the series actually refers to the fighting style of the main character, Syo Hayate.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Fu'un Mokushiroku - Kakutou Sousei - PCCB-00181) on June 21, 1995.

- UPDATES -

In the Japanese version:
* King Lion is named Kage Shishioh.
* King Leo is named Shin Shishioh.

Sengoku 3 (c) 2001 SNK.

Sengoku 3 is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players that differs from other games in the genre due to the complexity of its chain-combo based combat system. Rather than being limited to that standard one attack button, one jump button and a life-draining special move, Sengoku's button set-up is more akin to a one-on-one fighting game, with a light attack, heavy attack and long-ranged attack button, all of which can be utilised to create combos. 

Rather than simply mashing the attack buttons to create combo attacks, each of the game's four playable characters has an arsenal of special moves using directional inputs. Each character also has a super bar and several super moves that use varying levels of energy from this bar.

Sengoku 3 also introduces throwing weapons to the series but rather than just picking up dropped items and using them immediately, the game allows players to stash ranged weapons (but only one type at a time) including shuriken, bombs and kunai. As well as hitting enemies from distance, these weapons can also be integrated into players' attack combos.

Each stage end with a boss fight and two of the game's end-of-level bosses, once defeated, can later be selected as playable characters for the final two stages. The game's four playable characters (and two bosses who can become playable) are:

* Kegatsura
A Ninja and the main character of Sengoku 3. He's slower and stronger than average. His first super move is a diagonal downward beam of energy from his sword. For his second super move, he energizes himself with electricity and dashes forwards, slicing anything in his path as he streaks across the screen. He can also use the classic ninja staple; the Izuna Drop. His ultimate move is a lightning spell. 

* Falcon
A Spanish Ninja adept at very long combos. His first super move is a flame projectile shaped like a phoenix. His second is a dashing move. If he connects with an enemy during the dash, he performs a quick combo ending with a powerful flaming sword uppercut. His ultimate is a fire spell. 

* Kurenai
A female Ninja, Kurenai is the fastest character but also the weakest. She has excellent combo potential and is good for keeping multiple enemies at bay. Her first special is a spinning tornado slash. Her second special involves her creating three duplicates and dashing in various directions, hitting anything in her vicinity. Her ultimate attack summons a bunch of kaede leaves that damage everything on screen. 

* Kongoh
Kongoh is the strongest and slowest character. His first super move involves him stunning his enemy and then throwing them. His second is merely him tossing his rod forward. His ultimate attack creates a rain of falling iron rods. 

* Byakki
Byakki is one of the bosses that joins the fight after the third mission. He summons a demon from the underworld during most of his attacks and his first super move makes the demon's claw rise from the ground, hitting any enemy near it multiple times. His second summons a demon who then slashes any enemies directly in front of it. In his ultimate attack, he summons the demon who then causes meteors to strike all the enemies on screen.

* Okuni
Okuni is the second boss who, when defeated, becomes playable, also after the third mission. She mainly focuses on long range attacks and her combos are somewhat lacking. Her first move is a simple projectile wind burst. Her second is an electric attack using her fan. Her ultimate attack is a tornado of flower petals.

- TRIVIA -

Released in October 2001.

Developed by Noise Factory (their first game) for the original SNK Corp. (SNK's last official title).

Sony Music Entertainment / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Sengoku Densyo 2001 Original Soundtrack - SCDC-00102) on 18/07/2001.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Okuni and Byakki: Finish China (Easy), Italy (Hard), and Japan (Hard) - This tip was given on the original game flyer.

Sengoku 3's greatest asset is the sheer number attacking options available to players. There are numerous ways to start a combo, the most obvious of which is to simply walk up to an enemy and start hitting the light attack button, but at any time during a light attack combo you can interrupt with a heavy attack - a slower, more powerful attack that usually brings a weapon into the picture - and depending on how many light attacks you've already executed, the heavy attack will be different. 

You can usually use two or three heavy attacks in succession, with the last one typically ending the combo, but in the same chain you can also go back to light attacks after a heavy attack. If your timing is good, it's possible to 'juggle' an enemy as they fly away from you using various techniques, like dashing by double-tapping the forward button. 

Dashing into an enemy damages them slightly, knocks them away from your character and sets up a juggle opportunity, even if the enemy you dash into is already airborne. By using these methods in combination with good timing, you can keep combos going for 20-30 hits.

Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad (c) 1998 SNK.

More of an update than a full-blown sequel, Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad picks up where the first game - released a year earlier - left off. Once again, one or two players face the might of a terrorist army who are threatening to destroy the world by launching a newly developed weapon-of-mass-destruction if their wishes - to be given absolute control of the newly-founded nation of Billberk - aren't granted.

Like many Neo Geo sequels, 2nd Squad doesn't particularly do anything the original didn't do. There are some improvements, however; graphics have been given a brush up and level design is a little more imaginative than that of the already impressive original.

Sonic Wings 2 (c) 1994 Video System.

The first sequel to the superb vertically scrolling shoot-em-up "Sonic Wings", players once again take control of a Jet fighter aircraft and take to the skies to destroy enemy jets, boats, helicopters, gun emplacements and huge end-of-level bosses. The graphics are every bit as accomplished as those of the prequel and the game delivers a good level of challenge.

The end-of-level bosses change from game-to-game; a nice touch that adds variety to an already solid game.

Players can choose to play as any one of eight different fighter pilots, each of which pilots a different jet:
* American F-117A Nighthawk piloted by Robo-Keaton. 
* American A-10 Thunderbolt II piloted by Mao Mao. 
* Japanese Fighter-Support X piloted by Hien. 
* Japanese F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain Silver. 
* International F-14 Tomcat piloted by Cindy and Ellen. 
* International YF-23 Black Widow II piloted by Spanky. 
* French Rafale piloted by Steve. 
* British Sea Harrier FRS2 piloted by Bobby.

Sonic Wings 3 (c) 1995 Video System.

The third game in this excellent series adheres to the solid shoot-em-up template set down by its predecessors. The player takes on the role of a Jet Fighter aircraft pilot whose mission is to combat world terrorism. The object of the game is to fly from country to country and destroy all opposition around the world, before flying into outer space to combat the menace responsible for the terrorism. Each pilot has his own storyline that ties in with the game.

One enemy shot destroys the player's plane and releases a special power-up that the plane may have been carrying. If the player's final ship is destroyed, all power-ups and extra bombs are released and can be collected if the player chooses the 'continue' option, or if a second player is still active. However, on the final mission in Outer Space, the player is forced to start again at the beginning of the space mission, unless 2 players are active.

Sonic Wings now features an array of 10 selectable pilots:
American Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Robo-Keaton. 
American Northrop P-61 Black Widow piloted by the Blazers. 
Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero-Sen piloted by Hien. 
Japanese Aichi M6A1 Seiran piloted by Mao Mao. 
Soviet Il-2 Stormovik piloted by Chaika and Pooshka. 
Soviet Polikarpov I-16 piloted by Spanky. 
German Dornier Do-335 Pfeil piloted by Malcolm ('Pfeil' is german for 'Arrow') 
German Junkers Ju-87 Stuka piloted by Kowful and River. 
British Westland Whirlwind piloted by Alex and Pictus. 
British Fairy Swordfish piloted by Cindy and Ellen. 

There are also 2 secret planes (see the TIPS AND TRICKS section for details):
The Aka Usagi (Red Rabbit) piloted by Kotomi. 
The Diabloon piloted by The Man.

Some of the voice samples of Cammy and Dee Jay were changed from the original version:
(Japanese version quote - Export version quote.)

Super Street Fighter II Turbo was released in February 1994 outside Japan. It is known in Japan as "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challege".

In these Export versions, Gouki is named Akuma and all of Akuma's dialogue was removed instead of being translated. If Akuma wins a battle in SSF2 Turbo, he has no victory quotes.

Akuma's ending was all completely removed from the Export versions, with only a credit roll if you beat the game with him, along with pictures of his defeated opponents.

Some characters' endings are translated inaccurately.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 31 years ago:

Sunset Riders (c) 1991 Konami.

Sunset Riders is a horizontally-scrolling platform shoot-em-up for up to four players set in America's Wild West. Four sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West, before a final showdown against the infamous Sir Richard de la Rose.

The action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with play sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo. Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. 

Power-ups and bonus items can be obtained by entering saloons or defeating certain sack-carrying bandits. The power-ups comes in the form of either a golden sheriff badge (that gives the player's weapon auto-fire) or a silver badge that gives the player a second gun (making it possible to shoot in two directions simultaneously). Both power-ups can be equipped at the same time. 

Other weapons that can be used by players include sticks of dynamite carried by female bandits that can be thrown back at the enemy before they explode and a mounted Gatling gun available only in the last stage. 

A bonus mini-game appears at the end of Stages 2 and 5 in which players must shoot at enemies from a first-person perspective before the timer runs out.

Sunset Riders features eight stages of play.

Sunset Riders was released in September 1991. 

In the 90s, the official Italian importer for Konami was Elettronica Videogames. Managers of the Japanese company usually visited the foreign partner, bringing a lot of new games and prototypes with them. In one of this circumstances, they brought with them the European prototype of Sunset Riders. In this version, the Mexican character was named 'Hermano' (brother). During a funny moment, trying to say something humorous, the chief technician of the Italian firm proposed: "Why not calling him Cormano?". Cormano, in fact, is the little town near Milan where the importing company was located. 

King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Collection Vol.5 - KICA-7605) on September 26, 1992.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When you wait too long and don't give joystick/button input, the game shows on screen joystick/button example on how to play.

When you're facing off against the first boss, Simon Greedwell, there's a way to fire at him without being hit by his own gunfire. First, all enemies popping out of the house windows need to be cleared away, and the barrel on the left side needs to knocked down, exposing one side of the boss (but make sure you aren't hit and killed by the falling barrel). Then, position your player underneath that side so that he's firing upwards with the left hand at the left side of the boss (this is easier to do if you're holding two guns). If you do this correctly, you'll be able to gun down the boss while his own ammo passes by you harmlessly without touching you.

On the 2nd stage, as you're heading towards the train station where the second boss is waiting, there's an enemy-manned wagon that appears where the occupants throw out at least two logs that you need to jump over, lest you be killed by them. If you can anticipate the appearance of this wagon, you can shoot at the wheel almost instantly upon its arrival to destroy the wagon before they even throw out a single log at you.

On the 4th stage where you face off against the Smith Brothers in the saloon, they throw heavy explosives in your direction, so you need to keep jumping on and off the chandelier and in other directions to avoid their weapons. (Freeing the bar girls will render you intangible for a few seconds.) Don't try to jump onto the platforms where the Smith Brothers are standing while they're still alive, as you can be killed instantly when touching them.

On the 5th stage, the boss, El Greco, carries a whip causing instant death, and a shield. To succeed in hitting him, you need to try and jump around to shoot him from behind, as well as shooting him whenever he jumps, and to do your best to avoid being hit by the whip.

On the final stage, when penetrating Richard Rose's fortress, you need to use the Gatling guns provided to blast your way through two large wooden gates. Just jump onto the stands where your player will automatically grab the gun, point the joystick in the right direction and fire. But be careful, as the Gatling gun's ammo can kill other players as well as the enemy themselves

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 28 years ago:

Top Hunter - Roddy &amp; Cathy (c) 1994 SNK.

Top Hunter: Roddy &amp; Cathy is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players who take on the role of the galaxy's top bounty hunters, Roddy and Cathy, who are sent to put a stop to a colony of galactic pirates called the Klaptons, who threaten and plunder the cosmos. Four high-ranking Klaptons have taken control of four elemental planets and big rewards are offered for the capture of Sly, Misty, Mr. Bigman and Dr. Burn.

The game's action takes place on two plains, with players able to jump between the foreground and background at will. This switching mechanic is integral to getting through some parts of the game. In addition to standard jump and attack mechanics, both players have the ability to extend their arms outwards. This ability can be used to grab items and enemies, some of which can then be thrown. The arm can also be extended vertically upwards, allowing players to pull themselves up onto ledges, pull items down to them, or pull handles to trigger events, such as dropping rocks onto enemies.

Each stage has several collectables to be found, including health, weapon power-ups and extra time. At certain points during a stage, players may come across a Mecha; this is a bi-pedal mechanical walker that gives players more power. The mecha also has limited health, however and the player will be forced out of it when it starts flashing. 

Top Hunter: Roddy &amp; Cathy is split into four planets: Forest, Ice, Wind, and Fire and players can choose which planet to tackle first. Depending on what stage is picked first, the layout of that stage will change. For example, if the player picks the Ice world before the Forest world, the Forest world's starting layout will be different. 

After completing all four worlds, the player is taken to the final stage, where they must fight a rematch with the four bosses before the final battle with the game's antagonist, Captain Klapton.

- TRIVIA -

Released in May 1994.

The game borrows plenty of ideas from many of SNK's most popular fighting games at the time of its release. The two-plane stages were first used in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", also Roddy &amp; Cathy feature special moves that fans of "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting" are sure to recognize.

Mashing the attack button will make Roddy and Cathy go into a combo, with Roddy eventually letting out a flurry of punches, while Cathy does a Hyakuretsukyaku/Lightning Kick move. Doing a quarter-circle forward motion and hitting the attack button precisely will make the player do a Ko'ouken (or a hadouken with one hand) attack, while doing a shoryuken motion will make the player do a shoryuken/koho attack. The player can also do Terry Bogard's power wave as well.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Top Hunter - Shisekai Gakkyoku Zatsugidan - PCCB-00157) on July 21, 1994.

Twinkle Star Sprites (c) 1997 SNK.

Twinkle Star Sprites is a competitive scrolling shooter game originally created by ADK. It was ADK's last production for the Neo-Geo platform. The gameplay, which can be characterized as a combination of a fixed shooter and a versus puzzle game, uses combinations of shots, as well as timed power-ups to attempt to damage the opponent. These attacks also serve as counters to the opponent's attack.

An interesting &amp; highly cute hybrid between a Vs style puzzle game &amp; an overhead shooter, players may choose to play the Story Mode in order to see the misadventures of Load Ran &amp; her faithful yet somewhat annoying Rabbicat as they try to find the Magical Twinkle Star &amp; save their world from the evil Mevious &amp; his henchmen. The other option is to play the Free Character Mode in which you are able to pick any character (see codes under Tips and Tricks) to play the game and see their very own comical ending. A second player may challenge you at any time.

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 2b[A] Shoot/Use attack-stopper, [B] Bomb

- TRIVIA -

Twinkle Star Sprites was released in January 1997.

The game's concept seems to be a funny parody of the Sailor Moon manga, however the game's comic relief 'Rabbicat' seems to be a parody of Tenchi Muyo's very own cute mascot &amp; comic relief 'Ryo-Oh-Ki' the cabbit.

Load Ran &amp; Sprites feature different endings in the Free Character Mode, these endings are completely different to the one seen in the Story Mode.

In the story mode, Mevious will either taunt or praise you if continues have been used during your game or not!

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Twinkle Star Sprites - PCCB-00247) on 21/02/1997.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

There are two types of standard attacks: a normal shot and a charge-up shot. Each character starts with two bombs which enables him in the event of desperate plight, to clean with the screen while briefly acquiring a state of invincibility. The two players' playfields are separated by a vertical bar, each one having its own independent of the other. Series of enemies arrive from the top of the screen. The player is to successfully destroy them in chains (combos), which will send one or more fireball projectiles to the screen of his adversary (Normal Attack). Shooting at Normal Attacks several times reflects them back as glowing Reverse Attacks. If Reverse Attacks are reflected again, a number of powerful counterattacks in the shape of one or more indestructible enemies appear (Extra Attack). Reflecting many Reverse Attacks at once can instead summon a boss (Boss Attack).

* The Extra Attacks and the Boss Attack vary from one character to another.

* The power gauge fills as the player destroys enemies up to three levels. By holding down the fire button and releasing when a certain level is reached, the player can launch a character-specific charge shot to assist the player in clearing enemies from his screen. At Level 1, the charge shot is launched. At Level 2, the charge shot and three Extra Attacks against the opponent are launched. At Level 3 (Max Level), the charge shot and a Boss Attack are launched. Firing charge shots at Level 2 and above will decrease the power gauge.

* 30–40 seconds into a round, a blue orb appears among a chain of enemies. If this orb is destroyed in a chain, the player achieves Fever status for the next several seconds. Chains created during Fever generate faster and more plentiful Normal Attacks per enemy destroyed, which can prove to be very dangerous to the opponent if large chains are made.

* Both players are given five life points at the start of a round.

* Colliding into an enemy costs 1 life point, but the player cannot be killed this way; if a player has one life point left, he will be left with one half of a life point. When this happens, his character is stunned for a short while and is reduced in speed and attack power for several seconds after recovery, all the while left more vulnerable to opponent attacks.

* Getting hit by a Normal Attack, Reverse Attack, Extra Attack or the projectiles from a Boss cost 3 life points.
    
* The match is over when a player loses all his life points.

* When a player takes damage, his opponent recovers life points equal to half of the damage taken.

* If a round lasts longer than 100 seconds or the player does not fire a shot for more than 30 seconds, a Death enemy appears. If a player is hit by this enemy, he will lose immediately (Death Attack). The Death can be destroyed as any other enemy, but always comes back, harder to kill. Additionally, if a player is successful in volleying the "death" character over to his opponent's side, and the death character touches the opponent, the opponent dies instantly. This is a possible, though difficult, way to win. This, of course, would require the player to be skilled enough to avoid obstacles and not fire for more than 30 seconds.

* Special Codes:
Play As Sprites: At the character select screen, put the selector on Ran and press Up(x4), A.

Play As Memory: At the character select screen, put the selector on Ran and press Down(x4), A.

Play As Mevious: At the character select screen, put the selector on Griffon and press Up(x4), A.

Play As Dark Ran: At the character select screen, put the selector on Griffon and press Down(x4), A.

* After the Game Over screen, Load Ran &amp; Rabbicat rate your performance and either praise you or give you advice to improve your score, get a very high score (1,000.000 and above) in order to attain the highest rating and make Load Ran blush.

World Heroes (c) 1992 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.

8 heroes from different time periods compete to thwart Geegus, the evil alien end boss! Includes an extremely fun and unique death match mode!

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-053

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 3
=&gt; [A] Punch, [B] Kick, [C] Throw

- TRIVIA -

World Heroes was released on July 28, 1992. It is Alpha Denshi's first game in the fighting game genre. It was even the last game with the Alpha logo labeled within the game before the developer became ADK; however, the Alpha logo was last used on one of the arcade flyers of its sequel.

Due to the game's success in the fighting game market, the game was followed by a sequel, World Heroes 2, less than a year later.

The popular "Death Match" mode (removed from World Heroes 2 Jet and World Heroes Perfect) may have been inspired by the growing popularity of deathmatch style pro-wrestling in Japan at the time which was mostly made famous by Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling.

Hanzo is based on the real Hanzo Hattori Musashige (just like Hanzo in "Samurai Shodown").
Fuuma is based on the real Kotaro Fuuma Nobuyuki (1581-1603).
Kim Dragon is Alpha Denshi's homage to Bruce Lee (1940-1973).
Janne is based on the real Jeanne d'Arc who was burned in 1431.
Rasputin is based on the real Gregoriy Yefimovich Rasputin (1869-1917).
Brocken is loosely based on Rudolph von Stroheim from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
Muscle Power is most likely based on the real Hulk Hogan (1953-20XX).
J. Carn is based on the real Genghis Khan (1162-1229).

The first World Heroes game is also the only game in the series where Kim Dragon is Chinese. He was then changed into a South Korean character for the rest of the World Heroes series.

The name of the Scientist who invents the time machine in the intro is Dr. Brown which might have been inspired by the character Dr. Emmett L. Brown (a.k.a. Doc) from the Back To The Future movies.

World Heroes 2 (c) 1993 ADK.

14 characters and 2 end bosses do battle in normal or death match modes.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-057

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 3
=&gt; [A] Punch, [B] Kick, [C] Body Slam

- TRIVIA -

World Heroes 2 was released in April 1993.

Captain Kidd is based on the real Captain William Kidd (1645-1701).
Erick is loosely based on Erik the Red.
Mudman is similar to protagonist of Daijiro Morohoshi's "Mud Men" series in Monthly Sh?nen Champion Z?kan.
Ryoko is based on famous real-life judoka Ryoko Tani (formerly Ryoko Tamura). Fighter's History, released in the same year as this game, featured a character with the same basis and name (on a related note).
Shura is based on the legendary Muay Thai hero Nai Khanom Tom.
The last boss of this game was inspired by the character 'Baoh' from the manga of the same name.

The difficulty setting seems to have no effect on the game, the game is just as difficult on Level 1 as it is on Level 8!

The 'Skinhead' Deathmatch level, like in the first game, does not feature any trap or hazard to look out for, however the loser in this particular ring will get his/her head shaven!:)

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Alternate Costume Colors: Press B button when selecting a character.

* Most characters have a preset multi-hit combo that can be used by simply tapping the punch button many times while next to an enemy!

* Some characters that have hold-type throws (Kim Dragon, Ryoko, Muscle Power, Rasputin &amp; J. Maximum) can drain LOTS of energy of a CPU controlled fighter by quickly shaking the joystick left or right while performing a hold! Oddly enough, this trick does not seem to work with some character's holds such as Janne, Captain Kidd &amp; Mudman though!

		<name>1943 Kai: Midway Kaisen</name>
		<desc>1943: The Battle of Midway Mark II is a vertical scrolling shooter arcade game released exclusively in Japan by Capcom in June 1988. It is the third game in the 19XX series, an update of 1943: The Battle Of Midway, released a year prior. The title of this game translates from Japanese as "1943 Modified - Midway Naval Battle"

Not a proper sequel per se, 1943 Kai is a Japan-only re-vamp of the original 1943 that keeps the same setup and gameplay, while making a few minor tweaks here and there for variety's sake. A sturdy biplane replaces the staple P-38, the level count has been reduced from 16 to 10, and the weapon selection available from the 'Pow' icons has been increased to include the rare 'wingmen' option and a super-efficient 'laser' (a special weapon that could only be obtained via a hidden code in the foriginal 1943). Not just that, every weapon can now be individually powered-up by picking up the same icon twice - so word to the wise: go for two lasers and some wingmen immediately.

Well, some might say that it is almost exactly the same as its predecessor, yet 1943 Kai does have a slightly different flavour: it features an all-new soundtrack, and the overall rhythm of the game game has been increased. If anything, the core of the game is better - but then its kitsch biplanes, over-the-top weaponry and outrageous background colours (red sea?) give it a slightly tacky re-hashed feel, and make it loose the gritty pseudo-realism of the original.

The difficulty has been upped so that the game is even more unforgivably fierce... It's a quicker, tougher challenge - a souped-up remix specifically concocted for those who enjoyed the original.</desc>

- TRIVIA -

Fire Suplex was released on March 25, 1993 in Japan. It was developed by UPL and this is the last game developed by this manufacturer.

This game is known outside Japan as 3 Count Bout.

Fire Suplex is the only 'true' wrestling game for the SNK MVS Neo-Geo hardware but not the first. This honor goes to "King of The Monsters" (with giant monsters anyway!):)

Blues Hablam and Blubber Man are actually the same guy with the same ring attire, only Hablam sports a mask. The same occurs for Gochack Bigbomb and Big Bomberdir with Bigbomb wearing the mask.

The character Master Barnes enters the ring wearing Shoulder Spikes similar to the ones worn by legendary wrestling tag-team The Road Warriors.

		<desc>Maneuver a skier through a downhill ski course, a slalom course, and a ski jumping competition.

In Alpine Ski, the real enjoyment of skiing is presented by lifelike Down Hill Skiing, Slalom Racing and Ski Jump Competition. The object of the game is to skillfully maneuver your skier around snowmobiles, beginning skiers, and other obstacles in order to gain the highest amount of points. More advanced players will be able to move on to the slalom course and the jump competition.

The speed of the skier can be controlled by depressing or releasing the button. Skiing down the slope successfully allows a player the chance to challenge the slalom course. Be careful not to knock down any poles or you will receive a penalty. Completion of the slalom course allows your skier to go onto the ski jump. In the jump competition, use the RADAR found on the upper portion of the screen to maximize the distance of the jump for bonus points. Playing time is increased when the player reaches the specified bonus level.</desc>

In order to save the King - who, by sorcery, had been transformed into a monkey - a group of heroes must find the Jewel of Seven Colors and release the evil hex.
However, formidable monsters are lurking along their path. Prince Lassid, Princess Lisa, Sinbad and Afshaal, each armed with their own special magic and powers, set out on the quest for the Jewel of Seven Colors. Suspenseful battle scenes, skillful sword fights and a "magic lamp," which fells all enemies in a single blow, await the players. Their adventure to restore peace to the kingdom now begins.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<desc>Standard scrolling/shooting game with five waves of enemies that proceed down the screen. The addition of a fuel limitation adds to the urgency of the game, requiring that you eliminate all of each wave of enemies in order to make it to the final level with enough fuel.

The game of Astro Fighter consists of 4 waves and a refueling stage, which are then repeated with increasingly higher difficulty. The player's task is to eliminate the four successive waves of different types of attacking craft, while avoiding being hit by missiles and bombs, and then refuel by shooting the 'GS' ship before repeating the process. The player starts with 3 lives and receives a bonus life on reaching a score of 5000. 300 bonus points are received for shooting each 6 falling bombs and for 950 for hitting the GS ship accurately on the first shot. A very large bonus of 10,000 is given for getting through 4 waves and refueling by using exactly 2 shots more than the minimum needed. As the higher levels of Astro Fighter are difficult to survive consistently, even for the best players, the highest scores have been achieved by the achieving the 10,000 bonus deliberately.</desc>

		<name>Blue's Journey / Raguy</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 31 years ago:

Raguy (c) 1991 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.

Raguy is an environmentally-themed scrolling platform game for one or two players in which the peaceful home planet of Raguy has been invaded by the evil Daruma tribe. The Daruma are polluting the planet as they consume its dwindling resources and time is running out. 

Taking on the role of a heroic young man called 'Blue' (with the second player playing 'Princess Fa' in the two-player game), players must fight through fourteen stages, split over four different worlds, to defeat the Daruma and save the planet's eco system. 

Both Blue and Princess Fa have the ability to stun enemies by hitting them with a large leaf that serves as their default weapon. Once stunned, enemies can be picked up and thrown as projectiles at other enemies. Blue and Princess Fa can also shrink in size in order to access hidden areas, but they are not able to stun enemies while in shrunken form. If only one player is shrunk, they can be picked up by the other player and thrown as a projectile at enemies. Blue and the Princess can also jump on enemies' heads and propel them at other enemies, but if the enemy ricochets and hits the player, the player takes damage.

As well as the default leaf weapon, other weapons in the form of either boomerangs or bombs can be picked up and all weapons can be powered-up three times. Other items that can aid the players' quest include a plant stem that increases player Speed and additional hearts that increase player health.

Flowers are scattered throughout the stages and these are the game's currency to be used in the shops that occasionally appear. There are two different types of shop, offering either tips and advice for overcoming certain obstacles, or health, attribute and weapon power-ups.

At the end of each world players must battle a large boss character. Once the boss has been defeated, the game offers a branching path with players able to choose their next route.

- Get a very low score to get the cold shoulder from the princess.

- If you challenged your rival early in the game he will challenge you again. Beat him to get the princess. Lose to lose the princess. A tie and the princess can't decide.

		<desc>In Bomb Jack, the player controls Jack, who must collect all the bombs in order to complete the current round and go onto the next one. This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs. In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear. The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</desc>

Breaker's Revenge (c) 1998 Visco Corp.

A small update to "Breaker's" containing one of new selectable character, Saizo and different colored backgrounds.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: 0245

[SNK MVS Neo-Geo Control Picture]
2 players - 4 buttons per player.
=&gt;[JOYSTICK] 8-way, [A] Punch [B] Kick [C] Hard punch [D] Hard kick

- TRIVIA -

Breaker's Revenge was released on July 03, 1998. It runs on the Neo-Geo MVS and was never released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.

A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Unlock Bai-Hu: At the character selection screen, press Up at the same time on both 1P&amp;2P joystick.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Burger Time (c) 1982 Data East.

Stand-alone release of "Hamburger [Model DT-126]". For more information on the game itself, please see the original release entry.

- TECHNICAL -

Main CPU: MOS Technology M6502 (@ 1.5 Mhz)
Sound CPU: MOS Technology M6502 (@ 500 Khz)

- TRIVIA -

Burger Time was released in August 1982 in Japan. 

The game was originally titled "Hamburger" in Japan, but was renamed "Burger Time" before being exported internationally. It was originally made for the DECO Cassette System, an early arcade format that pulled the game data from audio cassettes. The cassette system enjoyed a brief bit of popularity, until it was discovered that the cassettes quickly wore out, rendering the game useless. Bally/Midway licensed this title soon after its original release, and redesigned the hardware to drop the cassette altogether. The Bally/Midway version of the game sold vast quantities when compared to the original.

This stand-alone version, manufactured without Bally/Midway's involvement, features a different attract mode.

When starting a new game (and a new life after getting caught), the game start display says 'Game Ready'. This was corrected to 'Get Ready' in the Bally/Midway version. It originally said 'Game Start' in "Hamburger".

When the chef runs out of pepper, the 'Pepper' display blinks, but there is no warning sound.

In the Data East USA version: 
* Gameplay is noticeably much faster than the other versions.
* 'Lives' dip switch can be set to 30,000, 50,000, 80,000, or None.
* The attract mode is exactly the same as the Bally/Midway version except for the different copyright information on the title screen.

Bryan Wagner holds the official record for this game with 11,512,500 points on September 19, 2008.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Stage 1

The introductory stage is very spacious and balanced, and you will only have to contend with three copies of Mr. Hot Dog and one copy of Mr. Egg. No one section of the stage presents any danger since ample escape routes can be found. At most, the burger layers only need to drop through five floors, so this stage won't take you as long as some of the other stages. Use this stage to understand the nature of the enemies' movement. Note how they tend to alternate between walking across a floor and using a ladder whenever they encounter one or the other that brings them closer to your position. Setting up the layers to allow enemies to drop with them is fairly easy to do.

Stage 2

While this stage features the same number of enemies as the previous stage, the layout of the floors makes the top portion of the screen much safer than the bottom portion. With the limited space and choices in the lower half of the stage, it is best to save it for last when you have no choice but to clear it. Focus on getting to the top as quickly as possible, but watch out for where the enemies are appearing. Staying on a ladder for a little while is a great way to lure enemies to a lower floor than the one you intend to visit. Once the two side burgers are complete, you must venture down the center of the stage. Before you do, draw the enemies as high as possible before heading down the center. Once you're ready to clear the stage, try to lure an enemy on to a top bun before dropping it. If you time it well, the enemies can clear the stage for you faster than you could. Note that the lower floors where the burgers wait are dead ends.

Stage 3

Even though you must build six burgers with only three layers each, this stage is a lot tougher than it looks. This time, six enemies will pursue you, including the never-before-seen Mr. Pickle. First and foremost, you need to get out of the bottom portion of the stage as quickly as possible. And the left is not a good choice for escape routes. If the copy of Mr. Pickle that enters from that side doesn't get you, another enemy is almost sure to come down that left ladder and trap you. Instead, head immediately for the right. If you're an expert player, you may choose to complete that lower right hamburger before continuing on to the top, but the more time you spend there, the bigger opportunity you give the enemies to trap you. Beginners should climb the right side of the stage all the way to the top in order to gain a little control over the enemies' movements. Like the previous stage, focus on completing the burgers at the top before tackling the lower burgers on either side.

Stage 4

You may feel a little daunted by the task at hand when you first see this stage: four hamburgers composed of eight layers. That's a lot of walking. But if you remember to focus your efforts on the top buns as much as possible, you won't waste a lot of time. The ladders are arranged in such a way that continuous climbing is difficult to accomplish. Instead, you and the enemies are more likely to staircase your way through the stage in order to get around. This can be a blessing and a curse. It's good because the enemies have few direct paths or multiple options to attack you from. It's bad because you need to become very skilled at controlling the chef in order not to slow down as you progress up or down the screen. The chef can feel very sluggish on ladders, and it can be difficult at first to properly time his transitions from ladder to floor and back to ladder again. By the time you complete this stage however, you'll have plenty of practice.

Stage 5

If you think that this stage is easier than the last stage because there's only half as many burgers to make, you're wrong. The layout of the stage is such that you have very few options to get from one section to another. Fewer options to move means fewer chances to escape so you must plot your course through this stage very carefully in order to avoid the six enemies that will be occupying the stage with you. There are two strategies to take. One involves luring the enemies to the lower right hand portion of the stage to keep them occupied for a while. This can be risky however, since you might become trapped from above and below. The other strategy is to employ pepper more liberally, provided you have a good supply by this stage. If you intend to use pepper, and wish to make the most use out of it, be sure to freeze enemies while they are standing on top of a layer so that you can walk across the layer and send it falling several stories with the enemy on board.

Stage 6

This is the last new stage that you will see before the game repeats the cycle of stages over again. In the heat of the moment, it's very easy to assume that certain paths on this stage connect when in fact they don't. Total comprehension of your available escape routes will decrease your chances of getting trapped and increase your chances of survival. The burgers on the side are especially dangerous since every layer is perched on a dead end. If an enemy is following you, it's relatively easy to drop a burger layer with the enemy standing on it, but getting out of the area can be tricky if you are too slow and allow another enemy to pursue you. You'll need to employ every trick that you've learned in the previous five stages to make it out of this one. The most important thing is not to panic.

Beyond Stage 28

The game will continue normally until stage 28. Starting on stage 28 the enemies move about 2 1/2 times faster than they did before. After 90 seconds (if you can survive that long on one chef), they slow down to a crawl, moving one step every 5 seconds. You can still die if you run into the enemies. The chef's speed never changes. If you can make it to the top of the board (28), you can find the "safe" spot. You can hide out here until they slow down. You will need new patterns for each board to group the enemies, and wait each time for each drop. It can take 1-1 1/2 hour per board at this level.

		<name>Bubble Bobble II</name>
		<desc>Eight years since the introduction of the renowned puzzle maze game "Bubble Bobble" comes its upgraded reincarnation with more excitement. Players select their characters from Bubblun, Bobblun, Cururun, or Cororon. Each dragon has its own characteristics. Beat the enemies, collect hidden items and reveal the secrets!

While the game plays identically to its predecessor, several new changes and additions have been made to breathe new life into the classic gameplay. As well as new bonuses, weapons, enemies and characters, players can now create 'Multiple Bubbles'; if the player holds the button down for a few seconds before releasing, up to three bubbles are produced at once.</desc>

		<name>Cameltry</name>
		<desc>There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball. The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.

That's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero. The game might as well have been named "inertia." Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing. Some influence the ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.</desc>

Bien que l’on pense communément qu’il s’agissait d’une version bootleg , le jeu n’a officiellement été exploité au Japon que lorsque Nintendo ne pouvait pas satisfaire la demande à la maison (même si Donkey Kong était toujours publié là-bas), et est basé sur un matériel différent. . Le jeu conserve tous les éléments de gameplay de Donkey Kong, mais a tous les graphiques redessinés et re-colorisés.</desc>

		<name>Cleopatra Fortune</name>
		<desc>Cleopatra Fortune is a 1997 falling-block puzzle game featuring an anime Egyptian theme. Groups of stones and gems of different shapes fall from the top of a well. Gems can be cleared by enclosing them within a group of stones, and stones can be cleared by making complete rows from them. Blocks will fall when those under them are cleared, which can create chains for more points.

The game includes three different play modes. First is a standard endless mode where play continues until the player is overwhelmed by the blocks. Second is a versus mode for two players. Last is a puzzle mode where the player is given a set field, a set sequence of drops, and a specific goal such as clearing all the gems or achieving a chain of a certain length. The puzzle mode has the player rescuing Cleopatra's friends who have been trapped in a pyramid by the evil Sphinx.

Following the initial arcade release in 1997, a PlayStation version and a Sega Saturn version were released in Japan, followed later by the Dreamcast version in 2001. A PlayStation version was released in the USA and Europe in 2003.  An arcade only sequel called Cleopatra Fortune Plus was released later in 2001, on the Sega NAOMI system. Both the Dreamcast port and this new sequel were created in association with Altron instead of Natsume.</desc>

The first race is in Brazil and features 100 cars, and requires you to finish in the top 80 in order to qualify for next race. As you work through the 8 races the size of the field steadily decreases, but so does the worst acceptable finishing position to qualify.

The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you hit a car or a piece of the trackside scenery you will be called into the pits - fail to make it back, or hit another car, and you will crash and lose several seconds.</desc>

Cyber-Lip (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

Cyber-Lip is a platform shoot-em-up for one or two players that borrows heavily from Konami's "Contra" series. Players must battle through sideways-scrolling levels, to defeat armies of cyborgs and androids and restore order and peace to the world.

Cyber-Lip has two shooting modes, one for standard weapon use and one for rocket launchers and grenade throwing. Players can switch between the two modes at any time, but only carry a limited amount of grenades or rockets. Weapon power-ups and additional grenades and rockets can be picked up throughout the levels.

At the end of certain levels, the game's heroes will enter an elevator and players can then choose whether to go 'up' or 'down', depending on which route through the game they wish to take. Each level has a large end-of-level boss that must be defeated.

		<name>Kaiser Knuckle</name>
		<desc>Kaiser Knuckle follows the same fighting game conventions established by Street Fighter II. The player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. The player has a character roster of nine fighters to choose from, and three bosses, each with their own unique fighting style and special techniques. The control layout is set to the six-button standard (a la most Capcom fighting games), but it can be switched to a five-button layout via dip settings. One unique feature is that Kaiser Knuckle was the first and only fighting game that has five strengths of basic attacks.

Another unique feature is that it introduced the power zones, which can be utilized via a successful hit of a special move when a player's "Crush Meter" is full. The power zones (either fire or electric) can affect the certain special move a character has. Backgrounds can be destructible when players get hit to charge up, and when those meters are full, the next special move that a player connects with his/her opponent will destroy the background's properties at will (other parts of stages, such as floors and walls are also destructible).</desc>

It is the first sequel to Double Dragon, released during the previous year. The sequel involves Billy and Jimmy Lee in a mission to avenge their girlfriend Marian after she is shot to death by the Black Warriors leader Willy, who is retaliating against the Lee brothers after his defeat at the end of the previous game. Double Dragon II was initially developed as an upgrade kit for the original Double Dragon, but evolved into a stand-alone game due to an increase in memory size, resulting in the developers reusing assets for both games.[1]</desc>

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 41 years ago:

Donkey Kong (c) 1981 Nintendo of America, Incorporated.

Export version for North America. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese upright version entry.

- TECHNICAL -

[Blue Upright model] 
The blue uprights (which are the most common), are a very rectangular affair, with quite a lot of artwork. They have orange-ish sticker style side-art (with Mario and Kong on them), with control panel, marquee, and monitor bezel graphics to match. This game does not use a standard arcade monitor. It requires a 'Nintendo Compatible' monitor (a normal monitor will display the picture like that of a photographic negative). This simple little monitor change basically launched the entire Nintendo Vs. Unisystem later on. Because only Donkey Kong series games and Vs. titles would work on these monitors (forcing operators to buy conversion kits for those games instead of a competitors game). 

[Red Upright model] 
The red upright versions are actually "Radar Scope" cabinets that have been factory-converted to Donkey Kong. These are fairly rare and feature slightly different gameplay.

- TRIVIA -

Donkey Kong was released on July 31, 1981 in the USA.

Donkey Kong was to be Nintendo's first big breakthrough into the western - and particularly American - arcade scene. Before Donkey Kong, Nintendo was having difficulty establishing itself in these markets. After the game's massive success Nintendo quickly established their headquarters of Nintendo of America to ensure that the game was being distributed properly. 

Mario was named after Mario Segale, the landlord of Nintendo of America's first warehouse location in Seattle (though it was debated whether this occurred before or well after the game was released). Mario was originally called 'Jumpman'; only the arcade version of Donkey Kong has ever called the hero Jumpman; most home coversions, particularly the NES version, game him the Mario name.

Accounts differ as to how Nintendo of America felt about the game before its release. Many sources claim that they all felt sure it would be an absolute disaster while others say they were more optimistic.

Although Mario is a plumber in later games, his career in Donkey Kong is that of a carpenter. Mario's appearance (and consequently his career) was dictated by the primitive graphics hardware of the time - the only way to have his arms appear 'separate' to his torso was to have them as a different color - hence he wears 'dungarees'. The mustache is present merely to indicate where Mario's mouth is, again due to the low graphics resolution imposed by hardware limitations. Mario wears a hat so his head is distinguishable from the game's black backgrounds. 

About 60,000 units were sold in the US. Oddly, despite it being one of the ten best selling games of the golden age of video games, it never reached #1 on Replay's popularity charts. Instead, it was stuck at #2 behind mega hits "Pac-Man" and "Ms. Pac-Man" - the two best selling games ever. 

Donkey Kong inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Do The Donkey Kong' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. 

A Donkey Kong unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', the 1984 movie 'Gremlins', the 1985 movie 'The Heavenly Kid', and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men' (Season 5, Episode 2 - People Who Love Peepholes). 

MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1982. Save the girl and avoid the barrels and fireballs as in the video game. The gameboard is laid out like the video game's Ramp Stage. 'Can You Battle Donkey Kong and Save the Fair Maiden?'. 

Donkey Kong also spawned a cartoon series of the same name: Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS. Mario was voiced by veteran voice actor Peter Cullen, while Donkey Kong's voice was provided by the late actor/comedian Soupy Sales (1926-2009). 

Michael Jackson used to own this game (Blue Upright model). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.

- UPDATES -

The original Japanese version had all four stages displayed in their original, logical order 1-2-3-4.
For this US version, they changed it to match the 'How High Can You Try/Get?' theme, with the stage order as follows: 
L-01: 1-4 
L-02: 1-3-4 
L-03: 1-2-3-4 (as in all levels of the Japanese version) 
L-04: 1-2-1-3-4 
L-05: 1-2-1-3-1-4 
L-06 through L-21 all remain the same as L-05 
L-22: 1 (Kill screen).

Destroyed enemies leave behind fruit which can be collected for points. Once all enemies are destroyed play proceeds to the next level which is generally more difficult.

Throughout the game, various power-ups can be collected, which represent potions, hammers, or books help the players' character speed up, receive more power, or kill in different ways. In certain screens various secret levels can be accessed.</desc>

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 27 years ago:

Double Dragon (c) 1995 Technos.

A head-to-head fighting game based on the 1994 Double Dragon movie, the game features a roster selectable which consists of "Double Dragon" alumni Billy, Jimmy, Marian, Abobo and Burnov, as well as 5 original characters as they enter a martial arts tournament to take out evil crime lord of Bloody Town, Koga Shuko. Unique features in the game includes destructible environments and a super move meter which fills out based on how much energy the player has left, giving weaker fighters a handicap. After defeating the default 10 fighters, the player faces Shuko's bodyguard, Duke, before fighting Shuko himself.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-082

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 4
=&gt; [A] Light Attack [B] Medium Attack [C] Hard Attack [D] Extra Attack

- TRIVIA -

Released in February 1995. Double Dragon was Technos' first game for the Neo-Geo hardware. This game was based on the movie 'Double Dragon', which was, in turn, based on the 'Double Dragon series' of games.

The game features a combo counter like many fighting games, however this one is not always very accurate since it registers Cheng Fu's Super Dragon Kick technique (Forward Dragon Punch motion + 2 buttons with the charge meter filled) as a single hit! The original Double Dragon logo can be seen in the large white boat on Cheng Fu's stage!

Billy, Jimmy, Marian and Abobo are the only characters from the original 1987 "Double Dragon" game who were featured in both: the movie and this game. Billy and Jimmy have the ability to transform into more powerful counterparts like they did in the end of the movie, while Abobo turns into his mutated form for a brief moment when he does his 'Grow 'n Throw' super move. Marian is depicted as a female gang leader, much like her movie counterpart. Burnov was the first stage boss in "Double Dragon II - The Revenge", while Duke was the final boss in the Super NES game "Super Double Dragon", although neither character were in the movie. Koga Shuko, the game's final boss, was an original character from the film.

April Simmonds holds the official record for this game with 96,700 points on April 21, 2007.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Double Dragon - G.S.M 1500 - PCCB-00175) on March 17, 1995.

- UPDATES -

MVS (arcade) vs. Home (neo-geo) differences:
- Arcade: If you beat the game without losing a round you'll see a drawing of each character posing while the credits roll. If you beat using a continue you just see the credits rolling on the screen in one of the monitors that fell on the last boss.
- Home: Regardless if you use continues or not you will only get the credits that roll on the big monitor screen.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play As Duke / As Koga Shuko: Go to the character selection screen and put the cursor on Billy, then Marian, then Chung Fu, then Jimmy for 3 seconds each. If done correctly you will hear the word 'Bingo!'.

* Alternate Costume Colors: Press B, C or D when selecting a fighter.

In 1984, along with the MSX1 port of the original, a sequel was released titled Exerion II: Zorni for the MSX1, with similar gameplay to the original. There were plans for an NES release of this game. In 1987, the game was followed by the semi-sequel titled Exerizer, also known as Sky Fox.</desc>

As in Pac-Man the goal is to collect all of the dots to advance to next level, but in Eyes the player shoots the dots rather than eating them. Computer-controlled eyes chase and shoot at the player. Shooting a computer eye gives points and removes it from the level, but it will reappear a short time later. Being shot by a computer eye is fatal.

As the game progresses, more computer eyes are added to levels and they take less time to shoot at the player. They also move faster. There are eight different mazes.</desc>

Final Fight can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with each player controlling a different character. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters, Guy, Cody, and Haggar, each with his own fighting style and attributes. Guy is the weakest but has faster attacks, Haggar is the strongest but also the slowest, and Cody has all-round attributes.

Final Fight consists of six stages or "rounds", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.</desc>

		<desc>In the arcade version, one summer night in 1991, an enemy fleet known as the Strange Fleet approached a small island of the Mediterranean Sea. When it arrived, very few saw the Strange Fleet. Two years later, while the Stranger Fleet expanded itself, it created a world war. It is unknown by everyone around the world who noticed the attacks of the Strange Fleet. As the Strange Fleet continues their assault, many against them cried "Fire Shark! Fire Shark! It's time to take off!! Beat them for our sake. Go! Go! Fire Shark!"</desc>

		<name>Forgotten Worlds</name>
		<desc>Forgotten Worlds, titled Lost Worlds in Japan, is a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up game by Capcom originally released as a coin-operated video game in 1988. It is notable for being the first title released by Capcom for their CP System arcade game hardware. The game took two years to develop, with a production budget of US$5 million.

Set in a distant future, an evil god known as Bios has destroyed most of the Earth, turning it into a desolated wasteland known as the Dust World. Two nameless supersoldiers are created by the people to defeat Bios and the eight evil gods who serve him.

Forgotten Worlds can be played by up to two players simultaneously. The player controls a flying muscle-bound soldier armed with a rifle with unlimited ammo. The Player 1 character is equipped with a long-range automatic rifle, while Player 2 has a short-range wide shot. The controls in the original coin-op version consists of an eight-way joystick for moving the character in the air while flying and a unique rotatable button known as the "roll switch". Rotating the switch left or right allows the player to adjust their character's aim in one of sixteen directions, while pressing it causes the player character to shoot his gun. This allows for the player to move their character anywhere while keeping their aim in one direction. Pressing the switch rapidly will cause the character to perform a "megacrush" attack which will destroy all on-screen enemies, but at the expense of a portion of their vitality gauge.</desc>

		<name>Frogger</name>
		<desc>Your task in this arcade game is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away from their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<desc>Frontline has everything you might want from a combat game, alternate two player option, 8-way smooth scrolling, and very realistic graphic representations of tanks, jeeps, and buildings. You start you campaign on Level Zero, the easiest of the levels which become subsequently more difficult. You start at a fire rate of about 2 bullets but picking up the blue bullet packs from the battlefield sees your fire rate rise to a maximum of eight. Excessive use of bullets leads to a reduction in fire power. Extra grenades lie in the green packs strewn around the battlefield. The object of the game is to enter the grounds of the laboratory which gives plans to achieve access to the next level. At the final level the laboratory holds he plans for the Enemy's new weapon and finding the plans sees you successfully complete the game. A pass is needed to enter the laboratory grounds and this is hidden somewhere on the battlefield of each level.</desc>

Galaxian (c) 1979 Namco.

Galaxian is a legendary single-screen shoot-em-up that took everything that made Taito's ground-breaking "Space Invaders" so good, and improved upon it on every level. Each screen starts with a wave of multi-colored aliens moving left and right at the top of the screen; the aliens quickly break ranks and start dive-bombing the Galaxip (player's ship) - either in single units or in groups of 3 - dropping multiple missiles as they descend. All of the aliens need to be destroyed before the player can progress to the next wave. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Galaxip: This is the name of the ship which you control at the bottom of the screen. 

Galaxian: These attacking aliens come in three varieties: blue, purple, and red. They begin in formation at the top of the screen and will occasionally swoop down to attack you before returning to their position in the formation. 

Flagship: At least two of these appear at the top of the formation at the start of each stage. They will swoop down to attack with one or two red Galaxians if any are nearby. If a flagship is one of the last enemies left of the screen, it will run away and appear as a third Flagship at the start of the next stage.

- TECHNICAL -

This was the first title to use the now familiar 'Namco Cabinet', which was used for Galaxian, "Galaga", "Pac-Man", "Ms. Pac-Man". Several other titles used nearly identical cabinets as well. These machines are white, with painted sideart of a green dragonfly alien (done up in blue, green. and black). The marquee is rather large and displays a blue and green 'Galaxian' logo (which is painted on a sheet of glass, they don't make them like that anymore). The control panel and monitor bezel are not highly decorated, but do feature some game instructions. Finally this machine uses neon green t-molding (edge trim), it is difficult to find replacement trim in that same exact shade.

The earliest Galaxian machines used a 25-inch G02 monitor, but later machines shipped with the standard 19-inch Electrohome G07 monitor. Any normal standard resolution arcade monitor should work as a replacement. "Pac-Man" PCBs will work in Galaxian machines, but require a 4-way joystick, instead of the 2-way model that Galaxian normally has. The sound pinout is also different, so one would need to rewire the connector to hear any Pac-Man sounds. You can also plug a Galaxian PCB into a Pac-Man. Again, the sound would need to be wired up at the connector and you'd have to push UP on the joystick to fire.

- TRIVIA -

Galaxian was released on October 31, 1979 in Japan.

Galaxian was the first video game to be released with 100 percent of its graphics displayed in true R.G.B. color. 

Space battles of all kinds played a major role during the golden age of video games. With the introduction of Galaxian, players were transported to the most colorful and challenging space battle yet.

* A place in video game history: "Galaxian captivated the minds of quite a few arcade enthusiasts," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "It was a relatively early entry in the golden age of video games, and it capitalized on the enthusiasm created by the earlier video game classic, "Space Invaders", while providing a more colorful, enjoyable, and demanding gaming experience.
Galaxian had smarter bad guys than "Space Invaders", and it demanded that the player really pay attention to what was going on. And there were no shields, like many games have today. You really had to stay on the ball. Galaxian also had great sound and used elements that have since become standard -- such as flags and other symbols to mark the player's progression through different levels of game play.".

* The great 25-cent escape: "Galaxian definitely gets an enthusiastic response," Lindsey said. "In fact, I deliberately position the game near the entrance of the museum. Often it's the first game people go to." Lindsey often sees parents trying to convey to their child the excitement of these great games. "It is funny for me when I see a father trying to explain a game to his kid. Junior really just wants to get on the game and figure it out, and Dad wants to do a demo. Dad starts instructing Junior while Junior is sort of looking around, wondering how he can get away. But Dad continues, busily explaining the nuances of the game, which he knows Junior can't get on the first play. This all shows the enthusiasm that a certain generation still has for these terrific games."
With or without a parent's help, Lindsey sees a younger generation embracing the classic arcade games. "Kids by themselves will actually do quite well on these games," Lindsey said. "I'm somewhat surprised when I see how good kids are at picking up games. I sort of think that because I'm older, I should be able to play better, and that's not always the case with video games. That's a lesson an entire generation has had to learn.".

* Namco notes: Galaxian was one of Namco's first video games, and engineers throughout the company were gathered into a special team. As the game neared completion, the engineers suspected they had created a good game because other Namco employees were extremely "excited and crazy about the game." Once Galaxian was released, they knew they had a winner because, as one Namco engineer reported, "People [at the arcades] piled their coins onto the game cabinets to keep playing, and those who were waiting were very irritated because their turn never came. There were huge lines of people around each machine.".

The Galaxian Flagship became a trademark of Namco as it makes cameo appearances in other Namco classics:
* "Pac-Man" (1980) and "Pac-Man Plus" (1982): The flagship makes an appearance as the bonus fruit in rounds 9 and 10, and is worth 2,000 points if Pac-Man eats it. 
* "Galaga" (1981): The flagship makes an appearance as one of the "transform" ships. It splits into 2, then 3 clones of itself. They are worth 160 points each, and killing all 3 scores a bonus of 3,000 points. 
* "Dig Dug" (1982): The flagship makes an appearance as the bonus vegetable in rounds 16 and 17, and is worth 7,000 points if Dig Dug picks it up. 
* "Super Pac-Man" (1982): All regular edible items on rounds 15, 31, 47, and 63 are flagships, and they are worth 150 points each. Starting from their second appearance, Round 31, they are 160 points instead. 
* "Pac &amp; Pal" (1983): The flagship makes an appearance as one of the "special items" that make Pac-Man turn blue when eaten, and allows him to stun the ghosts for a short while by shooting a Galaga-style tractor beam. It is worth 1,000 points if Pac-Man eats it or intercepts it from Miru. 
* "Pac-Land" (1984): The ghosts in airplanes sometimes drop flagships and they are worth 7,650 points (765 being Namco's goroawase number in Japanese) if eaten. 
* "Super Xevious" (1984): The flagship makes an appearance in a silver form and as an enemy, and sometimes several of them attack at once. They are worth 300 points each. 
* "Quester" (1987): In Round 5, the bricks form a Galaxian Flagship.
* "Pac-Mania" (1987): The flagship makes a 3-D appearance as a special item and in two forms as well, the other one being the silver form from "Super Xevious". The regular one and the silver one are worth 7,650 points if eaten.
* "Pistol Daimyo no Bouken" (1990): The flagship makes an appearance as an enemy along with the other Galaxian characters, and they attempt to hit Pistol Daimyo with their fire. 
* "Tinkle Pit" (1994): The flagship also makes an appearance with the other Galaxian characters, but this time they appear as bonus items. It is worth 800 points if collected. 
* "Tekken" (1994 - Arcade, 1995 - PlayStation) and "Tekken 2" (1995 - Arcade, 1996 - PlayStation): Winning at least seven rounds in Arcade Vs. mode will reveal the Galaxian flagship on the lower left (or right) hand corner of the screen. In order for this to work, "Number of Wins Shown By" must be set to Fruit. 
* "Namco Classic Collection Vol.1" (1995): The flagship makes an appearance in "Galaga Arrangement" as a Challenging Stage enemy in Space-Plant Zone (Stage 20) and normally in Space-Flower Zone (Stage 26). If killed normally, they are worth 150 points. If killed in Challenging Stage, they are worth 300 points.
* "Namco Classic Collection Vol.2" (1996): The flagship appears in both "Pac-Man Arrangement" and "Dig Dug Arrangement". In "Pac-Man Arrangement", it makes its appearance in World 4-1 and 4-2 and is worth 5,000 points if Pac-Man eats it. In "Dig Dug Arrangement", it appears in Stages 17 and 18 and is worth 7,000 points if Dig Dug picks it up.
* "Pac-Man World" (1999): The flagship appears again in a Pac-Man game. This time, the item must be collected in order to access the mazes.
* "Pac-Man World 2" (2002) and "Pac-Man World 3 (2005): The flagship teleports Pac-Man to mazes. The point value will be the same as the points earned in the maze (if completed), plus 2000.
* "Namco Museum Battle Collection" (2005): The arrangement versions of "Pac-Man" and "Dig Dug", later called "Pac-Man Remix" and "Dig Dug Remix" in the iOS version, feature the flagship. "Pac-Man Remix" features both the flagship, worth 3,200 points, and the red drone, worth 2,800 points, as fruit items, while on "Dig Dug Remix", the flagship is a vegetable item and is worth 7,000 points. 
"Dig Dug - Digging Strike" (2005): Just like the first "Dig Dug", the flagship appears as a vegetable on stage 13, except it's worth 6,000 points.
"Pac-Man Championship Edition" (2007) and "Pac-Man Championship Edition DX" (2010): The flagship reappears, but is this time joined by the Galaga Boss, Queen Gaplus, and two drones, one each from "Galaga" and Galaxian.

Gary Whelan holds the official record for this game with 1,114,550 points, achieved August 24, 2006 at Dukinfield in the UK.

The game can be played while the main game loads in the Sony PlayStation's port of "Ridge Racer".

- UPDATES -

The only code difference between the original Namco version and the licensed Midway version is that the 'Bonus Galaxip' text is printed on a different line.

In Namco Set 2: 
* Lives dip switch can be set to 3 or 5 lives. The default is 3 lives.
* Extra life dip switch can be set to 4,000 (meaning a bonus Galaxip at 4,000 points), 5,000 points, 7,000 points, or None (meaning no bonus Galaxip at any time). The default is 4,000.

In Midway Set 2: 
* Extra life dip switch can be set to None, 3,000, 4,000, or 5,000. The default is None.

In the bootleg version: 
* Extra life dip switch can be set to None, 20,000, 40,000, or 80,000. The default is None.

- SCORING -

Blue Galaxian: 30 points in formation, 60 points in flight
Purple Galaxian: 40 points in formation, 80 points in flight
Red Galaxian: 50 points in formation, 100 points in flight
Flagship: 60 points in formation, 150 points in flight
Flagship: 200 points in flight with one escort
Flagship: 300 points in flight with two escorts, Flagship killed before both escorts
Flagship: 800 points in flight with two escorts, Flagship killed after both escorts

* The maximum possible score shown is 999,990. Scores higher than this roll back to zero, but the high score will show the last score achieved before the rollover, which can vary from 999,990 to 999,200.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The action starts immediately as soon as you start your game. The Galaxians will be set up in formation and your Galaxip will be placed in the middle of the bottom of the screen. The action starts immediately. You can only have one shot in the air at any time so plan your shots accordingly. The game starts off slowly with only 2 or 3 Galaxians attacking your Galaxip at one time. They will drop 3 to 4 laser shots. As the waves progress, more Galaxians will come after your Galaxip until you will usually have 10-15 at any one time swooping down on it.

Each wave starts out with the Galaxians in formation, in the following quantities (in order from top to bottom):
Flagships: 2 (plus any that have escaped from battle in the previous wave, up to a maximum of 4 altogether)
Red Galaxians (Escorts): 6 (in 1 row, directly below the flagships)
Purple Galaxians: 8 (in 1 row, directly below the red Galaxians)
Blue Galaxians: 30 (in 3 rows of 10, directly below the purple Galaxians)

Flagships and red Galaxians are special enemies: they create convoys. Flagships have other special properties (see below). Purple and blue Galaxians are regular enemies.

* The Galaxip can fire only shot on the screen at a time. It is possible to kill 2 enemies with one shot if they are flying extremely close to each other.

* Missiles shot at the formation which miss by going between columns or near an outer edge of a column, will cause the formation to pause its left-right movement for a very short moment. This will usually, but not always, prevent missed shots near the columns from hitting the enemies in the upper rows of the formation which might otherwise be hit by moving into the shot as it flies by.

* Enemies peel away from the formation and attack the Galaxip. Enemies fire at the Galaxip during their attack, but they can’t fire after they pass an invisible horizontal line just above the Galaxip.

* Enemies always begin attack runs from the edges of the formation, never from the middle. This also applies to Flagships but it is not readily observable unless there are 3 or 4 Flagships present.

* A 'swarm' is triggered by either of 2 criterion:
1. The total number of enemies in formation is 3 or less.
2. The total number of blue and purple Galaxians in formation is zero. This can occur when there are many Flagships and red Galaxians still present in formation.

* When the 'swarm' starts, enemies that begin an attack do not return to formation: they keep attacking. Once started, a 'swarm' can only be ended by killing all of the enemies and/or letting them escape, or by the Galaxip getting hit. 

* Before the 'swarm' starts, enemies that attack, which are not killed, return to the formation. Since these enemies were on the edge of the formation and able to attack once, they are very likely to attack again soon.

* When not in 'swarm', a maximum of 4 regular enemies can attack at any one time.

* Flagships and convoys can attack at any time as long as another convoy attack is not already commencing; only one convoy attack can happen at a time.

* A Flagship will always create a convoy with the maximum number of red escorts available to it, unless the 'swarm' has started.

* The Flagships 'capture' up to 3 red escorts while they are in formation:  Whenever there is a Flagship in formation directly above an escort or above it to one side, that escort is captured and cannot attack on its own. This capture effect ends when a 'swarm' begins.

* The Flagships can escape from the battle only if all three red escorts under their place in the formation have been killed. Flagships that escape will appear on the next attack wave, up to a maximum of 4 Flagships at the start of any wave.

* When an attacking Flagship is killed, all enemies stop firing for a short period of time. If this kill occurs before the 'swarm', there will also be no new attacks from the formation during this period. These benefits never occur for killing a Flagship that is in formation.

* The flags which count the rounds show a maximum of round 48; rounds 48 and up are shown as round 48. However if round 256 is achieved, the flags start to roll over, but with some graphical glitches; the flags that were showing round 48 begin to get overwritten, one at a time. This results in the big 10-flags being cut in half by the regular flags which start to appear, until all 4 of the 10-flags are replaced by small ones. 16 single flags show during rounds 256+8 and 256+9 (rounds 264 and 265). The glitch ends at round 256+10 (266), which shows a single 10 flag.

* After wave 1, it is possible to kill any one enemy, even a Flagship, in a brand new formation by shooting at just the right time and place before the formation teleports in at the start of a new round.

* The Galaxians that come down in a smooth pattern are the easiest to kill plus their shots are easy to avoid. The hard ones to kill (usually the purple Galaxians) are the ones where the Galaxian 'bounces' from side-to-side dropping shots since those shots cover a very large area.

* The corners can be a death trap. When the Galaxians come down firing, their shots do not come straight down but they angle toward the direction that the Galaxian is traveling. In addition, the Galaxians have a tendency to 'charge' into the corners. You get the points if a Galaxian rams your Galaxip but you also lose your Galaxip in the process.

* The Flagships are the big points in the game. Try to avoid shooting the red Galaxians since they act as escorts for the Flagship. Wait until a Flagship comes down with two escorts. If you can't get aligned to take all three out quickly, let them pass. If you do get a good angle on them, you will have to fire quickly to pick off the two escorts first, then the Flagship. If you hit the Flagship first, you get significantly less points.

* Do not stop moving. If you do, you will be caught in a crossfire. The Galaxians tend to leave small areas of safety open between their shots. Also, make sure you are constantly hitting their formation to reduce their numbers (again, don't kill off the red ones).

* As you progress into the higher waves, the Galaxians tend to move quicker, fly more erratic patterns, and 'gang up' on your Galaxip. Plan accordingly for this.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.

[JOYSTICK] 8-way [A] Sword attack, [B] Jump, [C] Chain attack

- TRIVIA -

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Musashi Ganryu Tale'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Ganryu'.

This game runs on the Neo-Geo MVS but was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.

On April 14th, 1612, Musashi defeated the famous - and some think superior - fencer Sasaki Ganryu Kojiro using a simple wooden sword which he carved from a boat oar on the way to the duel. Musashi had an opportunity to see Kojiro's sword sometime before the duel and knew of it's great length. Musashi carved the wooden sword to be of greater length. When Musashi arrived on the beach for the duel, he kept the wooden sword hidden behind him until the duel began. He jumped over a low strike of Kojiro, reaching about a meter off the ground and came down hard on Kojiro's head with his heavy wooden sword. Kojiro lay dying on the sand and Musashi left in a hurry without killing him. Some of Musashi's critics call him a coward for not killing him, but Musashi had proved his point as the killing of Kojiro was not the goal - defeating him was. This is why the Kojiro character in Musashi Ganryuki has a huge gash on his forehead. The storyline of Musashi Ganryuki is that Kojiro has come back from the dead to try and kill Musashi.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Here are the statistics for the two characters:
Musashi: Power 4 - Dexterity 2 - Vitality 4
Suzume: Power 2 - Dexterity 5 - Vitality 3

		<name>Gekirindan</name>
		<desc>Gekirindan (逆鱗弾 "Imperial Wrath Bullet") is a vertical scrolling shooter developed by Taito where players select one of three different fighters (a futuristic fighter jet, a helicopter conditioned to space travel and a remodeled old-fashioned plane) against a destructive army of mechs throughout different time periods.

In the year 3195, a time machine is created on Earth and is promptly stolen by an unidentified, mechanized being known only as Huge-Boss. This entity then uses the time machine to travel back in time and destroy 3000 years of human history. The only resistance Huge-Boss faces is a group of pilots from different time periods who aim to stop him, although some of them have their own motives other than saving mankind.
Each fighter has a different shot pattern that can be upgraded or changed. There are also the side-weapon pick-ups including a pair of homing lasers, diagonal firing napalm and missiles.</desc>

		<name>Gigawing</name>
		<desc>An old-school style shoot-em-up.

Giga Wing takes place during a fictional war within a steampunk setting. The player controls one of four different futuristic aircraft and must destroy enemy aircraft, tanks, ships, and buildings using both guns and missiles mounted on the aircraft and a limited supply of bombs which damage or destroy all enemies on-screen when used. The game is based on the player(s) trying to destroy a medallion which possesses great power. Many of the bosses use the medallion as a weapon. At the end, it shows that an evil man who pilots a ship called the "Stranger" is the real person who is in control of the Medallion, and was responsible for the war, as well as other conflicts in the past including World War II, and you fight him three times as a mini-boss and as the last boss. He appears to be a friend of Stuck 30 years ago when you fight him with Stuck.</desc>

		<desc>In the darkest reaches of infinite space, pure evil lies in wait ... The Dark Forces led by the god of destruction, Bacterian, prepare to launch a massive onslaught against the planet Gradius. Possessing unstoppable power, the Dark Forces threaten to plunge the Universe into total war and complete annihilation. Their invasion force smashes the Gradius defenses, and the surrounding planets soon fall like dominoes. Now Bacterian's evil grasp reaches for the heart of the resistance...planet Gradius itself... To counter the oncoming threat the United Gradius World Forces gather all their fighter craft. Half of them form a defensive net - the other half a strike team. But they are badly outnumbered and The Dark Forces easily tear through their thin frontline. No fighters survive the slaughter.... In a last gasp move, the United Gradius World Forces send out two fighters, previously considered too dangerous for combat missions: The InterDimensional VIC VIPER fighters. The Fighters take off for the heart of darkness to join the fray that will decide the fate of the Universe...</desc>

		<name>Gun Frontier</name>
		<desc>Gun Frontier is a 1990 arcade vertical shoot-'em-up based on the animated series of the same name. The setting of the series and purportedly of the game is an extraterrestrial American Wild West, with the player fighting to defend settlers from airborne pirates -- the game, though, actually looks to be an entirely standard military-themed shooter, with the player's jet fighter set against tanks and other airplanes. Guns and bombs are levelled-up and collected by dropped power-ups, which are money-themed, with the gun upgrades shown as American dimes and bombs as gold bars.

Gun Frontier was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and was later included in the cross-platform compilation Taito Legends 2 in 2006.</desc>

		<name>Gyruss</name>
		<desc>Gyruss is a shoot 'em up video arcade game developed by Konami, and released in 1983. 

It was designed by Yoshiki Okamoto, who had earlier created Time Pilot for Konami. Gyruss was licensed to Centuri in the United States, and was ported to numerous games consoles and home computers. It follows in the tradition of space war games such as Space Invaders and Galaga.

Gyruss was the second and last game Yoshiki Okamoto designed for Konami, after Time Pilot. Due to pay disputes, he was fired after the release of this game, and soon joined Capcom, where he would write 1942 and the first Street Fighter game.

The game's background music is an electronic, fast-paced arrangement of J. S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565; this particular arrangement is similar in sound to "Toccata", a rock arrangement by the UK-based instrumentalist group Sky.

 Gyruss is notable for using stereo sound, which according to the bonus material for Konami Arcade Classics, was achieved by utilizing discrete audio circuits. The game used three microprocessors: two Z80 microprocessors and one 6809, as well as an 8039 microcontroller. For the sound, five AY-3-8910 PSG sound chips and a DAC.

Gyruss was released in both upright and cocktail cabinets.

R.Hirst "KOO", M.Jones, "BOX" and the Elliott Brother's are arguably considered some of the best Gyruss players of the 1990's.</desc>

		<name>Ibara Kuro Black Label</name>
		<desc>Ibara takes place in the 19th century, shortly after the development of the steam engine. Because of their precision crafting, the Northern European country of Edelweiss has excelled in the mechanical industry, and was achieving tremendous amounts of growth.

However, dark clouds would soon rise up over Edelweiss’ horizon, as Professor Teresa Rose spoke to her 5 guardians with a fearless smile on her face. “Let’s destroy this filthy land and its people. We must make this world beautiful. Yes… then we’ll make the entire surface a lovely rose garden.” Teresa began her attack from their fortress, resembling a twisted and jagged mountain of knives.
Under the Rose Garden Emblem, the nails of eerily laughing iron men destroyed buildings, the roars of planes covering the sky burn the Earth. The people’s cries and the rising flames illuminate the fortress, as if it were a beautiful flower blossoming from the scorched earth.

The Rose Garden’s power was horrific, but the Edelweiss forces pressed through the desperate battle. As the situation became increasingly dire, the Emperor ordered his Special Imperial Attack Unit, The Negotiators, into battle. “Annihilate the Rose Garden with your ships!” The Negotiators found that these “ships” had been secretly readied, as if predicting they would have to stand up to a threat and had longed for this day to come, shone bright.</desc>

		<name>Kaiser Knuckle</name>
		<desc>Kaiser Knuckle follows the same fighting game conventions established by Street Fighter II. The player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. The player has a character roster of nine fighters to choose from, and three bosses, each with their own unique fighting style and special techniques. The control layout is set to the six-button standard (a la most Capcom fighting games), but it can be switched to a five-button layout via dip settings. One unique feature is that Kaiser Knuckle was the first and only fighting game that has five strengths of basic attacks.

Another unique feature is that it introduced the power zones, which can be utilized via a successful hit of a special move when a player's "Crush Meter" is full. The power zones (either fire or electric) can affect the certain special move a character has. Backgrounds can be destructible when players get hit to charge up, and when those meters are full, the next special move that a player connects with his/her opponent will destroy the background's properties at will (other parts of stages, such as floors and walls are also destructible).</desc>

		<name>Karnov's Revenge / Fighter's History Dynamite</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 28 years ago:

Karnov's Revenge (c) 1994 Data East Corp.

The quest to defeat the mysterious Baron of Battlers, the mysterious "K", is on. In order to get to this grotesque gladiator, you need to fight your way through 13 with the most skilled, most deadly of all combatants in the world of physical contact. Use your powers of pulverization, psychic energy blasts, and ridiculous strength to become the explosive fighting god in FIGHTER'S HISTORY DYNAMITE!!!

Don't just participate in history, MAKE IT! The sequel of the first "Fighter's History", this time ported in the Neo Geo MVS Hardware. In this new version of the original game several changes and improvements were made to enhance the gameplay: now the battles are faster and more technical, with the usual friendly combo system that makes the fight so spectacular. There are also some powerful hidden moves added for most of the characters. Even the graphic was slightly enhanced, with a nice color palette and some wonderful backgrounds (especially Zazie's).

The game actually suffered from the reputation to be a 'SFII clone' given by the general opinion from the first episode. Thanks to this new chapter of the saga, which was particularly appreciated by the Neo Geo fans because it is one of the rare 'SFII style' beat'em ups on the Neo Geo this changed.

A really nice and classical beat'em up, still worthy to be played, especially for the real fans of the 2-D beat'em up.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-066

[SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls]
2 Players - 4 Buttons Per Player.
=&gt;[Joystick] 8-Way, [A] Fast Punch [B] Strong Punch [C] Fast Kick [D] Strong Kick

- TRIVIA -

Karnov's Revenge was released March 17, 1994. An important fact about this game is that it's the third Data East game to be manufactured on the Neo-Geo hardware.

This game is known in Japan and USA as "Fighter's History Dynamite" while in Europe as Karnov's Revenge.

New features and changes of the game:
* The controls discard the six button system of the first episode for the typical four buttons of the Neo Geo pad. In this way, the middle punch and middle kick attack are no longer available.
* New stages for every character and new background music.
* The portrait of every character was retouched a bit. Especially, the portraits of FeiLin and Karnov were both redrawn.
* New color schemes for the alternative suit's color of every character. However, the standard suit color of all the characters is still the same as that of the first Fighter's History episode.
* New vocal samples for every characters, except for Clown, Karnov and Mizoguchi: however, for Mizoguchi new samples for the win poses and a new 'scream of defeat' was added (in the first Fighter's History, when Mizoguchi lost, she emitted the generic KO sample shared with other characters).
* The in-game sprites of every character were retouched slightly in some determinate frames. 
* The design of Karnov was redrawn from the first episode.
* Faster gameplay. 
* New moves and new tricks for every character.
* New endings for every character. Even Clown and Karnov now have their own ending sequence.

The stage of Marstorius takes place in a ring placed inside the Colosseum of Rome.

The three children in the middle of the Samchay's stage are the two little brothers and sister of Samchay.

The extra round against the bull named 'Ox' (see TIPS AND TRICKS section to learn more) is a retrieval to the similar bonus game in "Karate Champ" (one of the first fighting games of the history, developed by same Data East on 1984).

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Fighter's History Dynamite &amp; Flying Power Disc - PCCB-00149) on March 18, 1994.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Karnov's Revenge introduced 'one-two attacks' to the series. Players can press a Strong attack button while connecting with a Weak attack button to chain the attacks into themselves.

The following special moves aren't listed in the instruction manual. These secret moves aren't super moves, just hidden special moves with less obvious motions. Samchay, Clown, and Karnov do not have these moves. Here's a quick legend: U=Up, D=Down, B=Back, F=Forward, DF=Down/Forward, and so on. A=Button A (LP), B=Button B (HP), C=Button C (LK), D=Button D (HK). Charge=Hold listed direction for 2 or more seconds

RAY
Thunder Dynamite Tackle: Charge B, F, F + A or B (Initial backward charge is longer than normal)

FEILIN
Kakkou HakkakuSoubiKen: Charge D, DB, DF, F, UF + A or B (can also be charged with DB, but may not come out as often, slides through projectiles)

RYOKO
KataGuruma: F, UF, U, UB, B + A or B (perform near opponent, may be done back to forward or forward to back regardless of facing left or right, doesn't damage opponent but sets them up for juggle combos)

MATLOK
Loop Hurricane: Charge D, U + C and D (tap C+D to maintain spin, can move left or right)

LEE
MouKo Kouhazan: B, F, DB, DF + A and B (destroys projectiles)

MIZOGUCHI
Shotensai: B, DB, D + A, B, C and D (press all four buttons simultaneously, perform close to your opponent)

JEAN
Rodanto: Charge F, D, DB, B + C or D (can be charged with DF)

MARSTORIUS
Drill Power Slam: F, UF, U, UB, B + A or B (may be done back to forward or forward to back regardless of facing left or right)

YUNGMIE
Fire Kick: Tap A and C repeatedly (can then move left and right)

ZAZIE
Deshikakato: U, D + C or D


* Beat the game without using a continue to see all the characters in chibi form grouped together during the credits. 

* If you beat the game without losing a single round you'll get an extra secret fight against a bull (Ox).

* Weak Points: The Weak Points and the relates dizzy system remained the same of the first episode. Thus, heavy hits will flash the weak point (determinate part of the suit of the character) and after a while further hits taken will make fly away the weak point with a BOING! sound and the character will get dizzy. Here is the list of weak point for all the characters of the game...
Ray: lightning (on shirt) 
Feilin: breastplate
Ryoko: headband
Matlock: headgear
Lee: knees
Mizoguchi: headband
Jean: leg band
Marstorius: leg warmers
Yungmie: waistband
Zazie: headband 
Clown: mask
Karnov: necklace
Ox (bull): horns

		<desc>The arcade follow-up to Yie Ar Kung Fu switches from the one-on-one style into a platform beat 'em up design.

You play Lee, who has become trapped in the Temple by the Triads, and must escape by over-powering them. Each section of the game is on several levels (which you can jump up and down) and scrolls. Balls of energy are sometimes released when you kill a Triad - grab this and it becomes a powerful weapon you can hurl at an opponent. Most enemies can be killed with standard kicks, but each level has a Super Triad who can only be killed through magic.</desc>

		<desc>This is a hack and slash game featuring King Arthur. Two other players can join the fight against the enemies. If you gain enough points you gain a level and increase in power.

Knights of the Round is an arcade game released by Capcom in 1991. A side-scrolling beat 'em up based loosely on the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the game features an role-playing video game-like level advancement system, with fighters getting new weapons and armour as they advance through the game, however the player can not choose how to upgrade his/her character - the level up system is static.</desc>

		<name>The King of Dragons</name>
		<desc>Up to three players fight in a horizontal scrolling fantasy world against orcs, skelettons, magicians and dragons.

The King of Dragons is a 1991 side-scrolling hack and slash video game that allows players to choose from five characters (Elf, Wizard, Fighter, Cleric, and Dwarf) in order to travel through the kingdom of Malus and defeat the monsters that have taken over, as well as their leader, the red dragon Gildiss. Like Capcom's Knights of the Round, it features a level advancement system, allowing character attributes to be upgraded as players progress through the game. The setting is very similar to that of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other medieval fantasy worlds, with familiar monsters such as Orcs, Gnolls, Harpies, Wyverns, Cyclopes, and Minotaurs.</desc>

The King of Fighters 2001 (c) 2001 Eolith.

With the largest KOF lineup totaling at 40 characters, newcomers Eolith do a great job at delivering high quality fighting action along with one of the most difficult pairs of bosses in fighting game history!

- TRIVIA -

Released in October 2001.

A hack of this game is known as "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 2003".

About Ron: the planners at the time enthusiastically came up with the idea of the Flying Brigands, the idea being to add a thrilling side story to KOF. Ron became the chief of this bunch. His first appearance came in the ending sequence for Benimaru's Team in KOF 2000. This ending sequence got first-rate reviews for its content and presentation, becoming one of the most popular episodes in the history of KOF. From KOF 2000 on, the background story became more complex on various levels, but subsequently SNK had a few problems (sniff, sniff) causing Ron's creators (the planners at the time) to go their different ways... Whenever the current staff who continue to work on KOF run into the original staff on the train to work, they are sure to grill them about Ron's background (thanks for your cooperation, by the way!). As a result of all this, he made a grand entrance as the boss characters' Striker in KOF 2001. The numerous characters who were involved with him, too, continue their exploits in the world of KOF even now. Ron is a character who uses the tricky actions from Chinese boxing and he continues work on reaching his ghoulish objective to be able to manipulate the dead. Just when he'll be able to appear as a player character is a mystery even to us...

About May Lee: one reason of existence for May came from a consideration of the needs of our Korean fans. In addition to that, Eolith, a sponsor at the time, expressed their desire for a character like a 'Korean Athena'.  This request asked for an 'idol-like visual fighter', or something along that line, and designers recall that it really threw us for a loop. Through trial and error, designers arrived at a character that was a long way from the original concept, but with this process May Lee, the perky tae kwon do fighter for justice, was born. Designers got her name from the person who was in charge of Eolith (Eolith Co., Ltd.) at the time.

About Foxy: Rumor has it that a lot of fans think Foxy died in KOF 2001, but she's alive and well (LAUGH). Initially there were no plans for her to become a player character, but her presence was needed as the story developed and she got the go-ahead. Originally Foxy was to be a character spun off from Diana, but it seems the plan just didn't work. In the end there just wasn't enough time; the graphics were worked out with great effort, but she got the boot as a result of time constraints.

About K9999: K9999 is Eolith's homage to Tetsuo from Akira. His voice actor also did Tetsuo. For various reasons K9999 is a scary character to deal with. Of course he's based on 'you know who' and has, well, similarities that we're happy a certain 'you know who' didn't object to. If you count the similarities between 'you know who' and the other 'you know who', you'd be counting from now to St. Swithun's Day. K9999 boasts a big following of fans in Korea and Japan, but no other character has such obstacles against him appearing in KOF again.

About Angel: Angel was realized through the overwhelming passion of her designer (LAUGH). You could say that there was just no stopping him. You can see his preferences in almost every aspect of her. She's a real rascal who has a lot of special moves like the 'Unchained Circle' and is one tough customer to deal with. Designers splurged on the voice for Angel in KOF 2001 and hired Mina Tominaga, a famous Japanese voice actress. Angel's designer was quite pleased with that...

About Zero (The Original): the supervising designer was dissatisfied with KOF 2000's Zero so he struggled with his disappointment and completed this character. Must have been that little mustache (LAUGH). And the character of Glaugan (King Lion) at his side also got nixed and wasn't used in KOF 2000 either. Talk about not getting your way! Along with polishing Zero, he was tortured with mission to realize his first boss character after leaving SNK that surpassed Krizalid's presence and strength.

About Igniz: since all designer's sponsor had to say to us-about 100 times-about Igniz was "make him hot", "make him hot", and "make him hot", Designers made him, well, a real stud. The standards for handsome characters in fighting games for Asian fans are exacting; and there is a tendency for people here to shy away from ugly and comic characters. Designer think he serves so well as a foil, the lead character comes off all the better.

Yuri's battle start pose is a knock-off of Felicia's battle start pose in "Vampire Savior - The Lord Of Vampire". Besides this, Yuri has the special attack of Gouki, the one that grabs your opponent and then the screen turns black as he gives you 30 hits in 3 seconds. This move is called the 'Yuri Chou Enbu' (means 'Yuri Super Flame Dance'). The move can only be made with the special gauge at max (with at least 1 striker - The sequence is: A, A Forward, B, C). Yuri will get Gouki's 'Messatsu' pose if you finish your opponent with it. It's a parody of Gouki's super finish splash screen (the one with the kanji 'ten' on it when he finishes his opponent with the Shun Goku Satsu).

Athena, in one of her win poses, dances about and says 'Yattai!' in a very familiar way... She's parodying Chun-Li!

The little kid that appears in Terry Bogard's win poses is none other than a young Rock Howard from "Garou - Mark of The Wolves". Since Garou takes place in 2008, Rock is still a young kid in training during this game.

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

The King of Fighters 2002 - Challenge to Ultimate Battle (c) 2002 Playmore Corp.

The King of Fighters 2002: Challenge to Ultimate Battle is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players and is the ninth game in the series.

The game discarded the 4-on-4 "Striker Match" format used in the previous three games in the series and returned to the 3-on-3 Battle format used prior to "King of Fighters '98".

The King of Fighters 2002 also revamped the Power Gauge system into a format similar to the one used in KOF '97. As with previous games in the series, the Power Gauge is filled as the player attacks their opponent or performs Special Moves. The number of Power Gauges the player can stock up is increased by one with each member of the team. For example, the first member of the team can stock up to three Power Gauges, while the third member can stock up to five. 

A single Power Gauge stock can be used to either perform a Counter-attack and evasion technique while guarding against an opponent's attack, to use a Super Special Move, or to initiate the MAX Activation state. The same case also applies to the 1-on-1 format, in which the Power Gauge the player can stock up is also increased by one with each round loss (for example, on the first round, the player can stock up to three Power Gauges, while losing two rounds allows the player to stock up to five).

During MAX Activation, the player's offensive and defensive strength is increased for a short period. In this state, a Super Special Move can be used without consuming Power Gauge stock. There are also MAX Super Special Moves, which are Super moves that can only be performed during MAX Activation with one Power Gauge stock, and MAX2 moves, that require two stocks while low on health.

Developed by Eolith Co., Ltd.

Released in October 2002.

About Kusanagi: As the NESTS Chronicles began, Kyo's school uniform changed to a white outfit but his trademark was his black school uniform (even though he's over 20!). Because of some desired the return of the old Kyo, he was inserted into the game at the last moment. In KOF 2003, KUSANAGI was treated as phantom that Chizuru produced with the power of the Mirror of the Yata. But you can't have Kyo without a school uniform. Maybe in Chizuru's mind Kyo will always be a high school student.

About Orochi Yashiro: The characters commonly referred to as Shadow Yashiro, Shadow Shermie, and Shadow Chris were first formulated to balance out the Japan Team of Kyo, Benimaru, and Daimon. Needless to say, Yashiro was 'a character who used powerful body slams associated with the earth and earthquakes' in the same vein Daimon did. He's a dynamic guy who doesn't fret over tiny details, but his hobby is playing guitar in his band. The band's name has never been officially revealed, but it is known as 'C.Y.S.' He idolizes the guitarist Paul Gilbert, and has quite a detailed background story to him.

About Orochi Shermie: If Yashiro offsets Daimon, Shermie is Benimaru's counterpart who ''manipulates lightning and thunderclap attacks''. But the supervising planner made sure, through trial and error, Shermie would simply not become a ''female Benimaru''. Various ideas were added to make her a new, unique character. The ''Moonless Thundercloud'' Shermie heaves up with a belch is an example of this, as is the ''Willow Whip'' move she uses to mow down opponents with flailing arms. Incidentally, these moves were called the ''Explosive Belch'' and the ''Back off, You Beasty'' moves during development.

About Orochi Chris: Chris, of course, is Kyo's counterpart, 'a manipulator of flame'. At the inception of production, the plan was for Chris to use the 'Flame of Darkness (Black Flame)', but the black flames were hard to see so the designers settled for purple ones. When it came time to name Chris's arsenal of moves, we remember the director saying, 'The Dark Orochi Wave sounds good'. But other planners objected: 'It's dumb for an Orochi character to have 'Orochi Wave' as a move name. It's like saying, Call me Mr. Chris'. Regardless, the director won out.

The little kid that appears in Terry Bogard's win poses is none other than a young Rock Howard from "Garou - Mark of The Wolves". Since Garou takes place in 2008, Rock is still a young kid in training during this game.

KOF2002 contains pieces of music from older KOFs. Here's a complete list of themes, the teams (or individuals) they belong to and the games they were taken from:
Tears (Kyo Kusanagi) - "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle" (Kyo Kusanagi's theme music).
Kurikinton (Fatal Fury Team) - "Fatal Fury 2" (Terry Bogard's theme music).
Beauty &amp; The Beast (Art of Fighting Team) - "The King of Fighters 2000" (Art of Fighting Team's theme music).
Jungle Bouncer (Ikari Team) - "The King of Fighters '94" (Ikari Team's theme music).
Psycho Soldier (Athena Asamiya) - "Psycho Soldier" (what part of the game?).
Diet (Gals Fighters Team) - "Art of Fighting 2" (Yuri Sakazaki's theme music).
Arashi no Saxophone 2 (Iori Team) - "The King of Fighters '96" (Iori Team's theme music).
Bloody (New Face Team) - "The King of Fighters '97" (New Face Team's theme music).

- TRIVIA -

Released in November 2003, KOF2k3 represents the latest opus in the series to run on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.

Two new systems have been adopted: 'Tactical Leader System' which sets up a leader favorably treated in capability in a team and 'Multi-Shift' in which player characters can be changed freely during 3 on 3 battle.

About Ash Crimson: Unlike the usual KOF hero characters, Ash was designed with the intent to create an 'attractive evil character'. Because the supervising designer created a rough design that fit the desired appearance to a 'T', little was changed for this character's design. Incidentally, the team story quotes casually from Robert Browning's 'Spring Song', but no one on the staff took interest in this (Boo hoo). And the bit about Shanghai Crabs was the original material for the character 'Rojin'.

About Duo Long: When speaking of the Flying Brigands, you have quite a collection of especially unique-looking characters, but Duo Long is, unlike those of his ilk so far, an orthodox, handsome character. The model for this character is a certain Romanian vampire and hunter with the same first letter for his name. A subtly embroidered dragon is depicted on the back of Duo Lon's costume, but according to the illustration's supervising designer Falcoon, this character sports a detailed character that follows the steady work of traditional craftsmen with the scales drawn one at a time...

About Shen Woo: The first concept for this character was a wild and sexy guy. The development codename for him was ''The Third Man'', and along those lines he became Woo Shen, his name 'flip-flopping' to the current name, and the latter moniker seemed to stick. Because Ash has his particular appearance (LAUGH), Shen, no matter how you look at it, appears more like the main character. His character closely resembles certain aspects of Ralf and Yashiro in many ways, so designers toiled to create distinctive moves for this character. According to the supervising designer, 'What knotted my stomach most was the shortness of time we had for development'.

About Tizoc: To tell the truth, Raiden was to appear in KOF 2003, but before the characters were finally decided on, Tizoc took his place. Along with the change to KOF 2003's game system, designers were able to create movements heretofore impossible with KOF until now, allowing us to add the style of Tizoc for that very reason. It's unclear whether there were plans or not to introduce Grant from "Garou - Mark of the Wolves" along with Tizoc for a friendly tag team battle. It may not be very well known, but the Japanese name for Tizoc is 'Griffon Mask'. But we felt Tizoc for the English version had a nice ring to it.

About Gato: Keeping the demands of the Chinese market in mind, designers included a user of orthodox Chinese boxing in the game to follow our marketing plans and enter the battle with Tizoc from "Garou - Mark of the Wolves". Halfway through the development process, he became the character that was busy getting burned, frozen, and slapped around with a giant metal ball by other characters to experiment with the overhauled program. When Gato appeared, many groundless rumors circulated that 'Hotaru had made a comeback' and other such rumors to the same. Whatever command you enter, be aware that Hotaru Futaba is nowhere to be found in KOF 2003, and Gato is here to stay!

About Malin: KOF 2003 saw the absence of Choi Bounge, so why not make a nimble and cute girl character?! And with that sentiment, Malin was born. It took quite an effort to arrive at the initial design for this character, but when we entered the actual work for KOF 2003, the creation of this character was a piece of cake. In the appearance sequence, the supervising designer poured his sincerity into the transformation scene. But the Arcadia magazine realized that she wasn't included in their feature articles and regretted their mistake. If you consider our preferences, designers insisted on the spelling for this character to be 'Malin' and not 'Marin'. This is the humble preference of the supervising designer and a mystery to us all.

About Maki Kagura: If the younger sister Chizuru Kagura is the stork, the elder sister Maki Kagura's name comes from the tortoise (storks live a thousand years, but tortoises live 10,000). The background story for these two twins comes from KOF '96, but with their appearance in KOF 2003, some designers suggested Maki's hair be shortened to distinguish her from her kid sister. She appears in KOF 2003 as she always does (Her bangs are slightly different, however, so people who have confidence in their powers of observation, beware!). For the location test of KOF 2003, many players who defeated Chizuru were vanquished by the awesome elder sister Maki. So the fate of players was often decided with the appearance of Maki-you just don't mess around with this character!

About Adelheid: To widen the worldview of KOF with the desire to add a separate story to the main tale, designers added this character devised as a set with her kid sister Rose. Designers think many picked up on this, but Adelheid is a common female name among Swiss and Germans, and is the name from which the diminutive of Heidi's derives. In the Adelheid stage of KOF 2003, the soundtrack begins with Chopin's 'Revolutionary Etude', but including something like this on the NEO-GEO system required a huge amount of memory which overwhelmed the voice data of other characters. Designers believe it was worth it, but producers may have dissed the supervising designers of other characters in the process.

About Rose: If Hinako was the modern, unconventional 'na?f', Rose is the classic 'sophisticate' character. She has an overpowering sense of pride and high-handedness. She's also selfish and moody. If things don't go her way, watch out! But she's a real babe and not only that, she's rich! (Laugh). The voice actor for Rose also worked on Malin and Maki Kagura. Because she had a tough schedule providing the voice for three characters in one day, she was really put through a tough trial. The staff regrets this and gives their thanks from the bottom of the ocean.

About Mukai: With the belief that a fighting game boss 'must be easy to understand', designers adopted the 'ability to fossilize' to give impact to Mukai's presence. Designers then matched the design of this character to this ability. So as far as the procedure of development is concerned, Mukai was quite an unorthodox creation. The concept and design came off without a hitch, but arriving at his name was a difficult process. He's among the first of the KOF series boss characters who would be graced with the Japanese honorific of '-san'.

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

Scitron Digital Content released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters 2003 Original Sound Trax - SCDC-00337) on 24/04/2004.

Hacks of this game are known as:

- TRIVIA -

Released in July 1995.

The background for the Japan Team is, in fact, a real place.

Yuri's Chou Upper is very similar to Sakura's own Shou'ou Ken.

Iori Yagami: Since the KOF '95 project began with the concept of introducing Iori as Kyo's rival, he became known as a character who was a member of a rival school of martial arts that had a connection to the Ancient Arts of the Kusanagi. He was also given the ability to use a different color of flames other than Kyo's (red flames), along with various other characteristics. When you think of Iori Yagami, his intense personality most likely comes to mind. His moves are unique, and his singular choice of hairstyle, wardrobe, and manner of speaking was certainly a personality that broke the mold for characters in fighting games at that time. During the initial location tests to determine the popularity of the game, Iori was the character who stood out most. His hair and his lines to provoke his opponents ('You think I'm scary, do you?') excited his fans to no end. What set him apart are his memorable lines: 'You cry! You scream! Then you die!', 'Think of me when you gaze at the moon', and a whole catalog of others too numerous to list here.

Billy Kane: Along with Eiji, Billy appears as Iori's 'teammate' (ha, ha) in KOF'95. With the three rivals to the heroes coincidentally appearing on a single team, the name of the 'Rival Team' was decided upon as an afterthought. But since we couldn't wait for the rest of the world to get used to that concept and given the insanity of Iori, the team had to disband after their single appearance in KOF'95. As memory serves, the designers for this team were so motivated to create this team that their finished product was quite impressive. As a matter of fact, the voice actors worked like busy beavers to give the characters their lines. These characters were portrayed by Mr. Namase in '95, Mr. Yamanishi in '97, '98 and '02 and Seijiro in '03.

Omega Rugal: After apparently dying in KOF '94, Rugal's resurrection in KOF '95 turned him, convincingly enough, into a cyborg (prosthetic arms) armed (pardon the pun) with the power of the Orochi. In the subsequent titles of KOF '98 and KOF 2002, Rugal was brought back not once but twice to conclude story-lines. Why? "He's the only character who truly represents the ultimate KOF boss". Among these, Omega Rugal from KOF '98 was the most powerful and had the flashiest moves, so he's one of our personal favorite boss characters of the series.

Saisyu Kusanagi: His first appearance was, of course, in KOF '94, but his presence in KOF '95 was never planned (because he was supposed to have died in '94). During the final stages of KOF '95, he suddenly was inserted as a mid-level boss. That's who Saisyu Kusanagi is. Given that spur of the moment appearance, it's quite unexpected that he's still a very popular character? no offense to him, mind you. During location tests for the game, not one of his fans read the Chinese characters for his name as 'Saisyu', and he came to be known as 'Shibafune'.

Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '95 - PCCB-00187) on 19/08/1995.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Rugal and Saisyu Kusanagi: At the team edit screen, the 15 second counter, press and hold Start. While holding start, push Up+B, Right+C, Left+A and Down+D. The two bosses should then appear on either side of the counter and the counter should reset back to 15.

* Select Victory Pose: Press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.

* Beat the game on Hard or MVS mode without continuing to see a collage of all the teams after the credits.

- TRIVIA -

Released in July 1997.

Yuri has a long record of taking movements from other characters, especially Capcom (see previous KOF entries). In this new opus: Yuri's new special attack 'Hien Rekkou' is a knock off of Ken's Shoryuu Reppa.

Roddy and Cathy from "Top Hunter - Roddy &amp; Cathy" appear in the Kowloon background at the extreme left.
Other characters appearing in the Kowloon stage are: Roddy Birts and Lenny Creston from "Art of Fighting 3 - The Path of the Warrior".
The American Sports team from "The King of Fighters '94".
Lee Pai Long, Tung Fu Rue and Jubei Yamada from "Art of Fighting" and "Fatal Fury Special" and King's Waitresses with Rugal's panther.

The Terry's theme music was originally from "Real Bout Fatal Fury Special".
The Ryuji Yamazaki and Mary's Blues theme music was originally from "Real Bout Fatal Fury Special".
The Athena Asamiya thene music come from "Psycho Soldier".

The name of the 3 characters instrumental in the defeat of Orochi have some relation to the original legend:
1) Kyo Kusanagi: The Kusanagi is the name of the sword that was used to kill the Great Serpent.
2) Iori Yagami: One of his moves, the Ya Sakazuki, means '8 wine cups', which were needed to get the Great Serpent drunk.
3) Chizuru Kagura: She was the last surviving member of the Yata clan and the mirror used to seal Orochi away was a homage to the mirror in the legend (in the legend, it was a mirror created by the Great Serpent's tears).

In this iteration of KOF and the following games where he is a playable character, Choi Bounge gains a special throw (using the D button) where he pokes his claws up the opponents rear, this is actually supposed to be a Japanese prank, but the pranksters do not use claws.

About Ryuji Yamazaki: To bring the story that had grown too large and out of control back on track, the members of the Orochi 8ketsu Clan were teamed up in '97. By doing this, the dev. team thought, the story would reach its conclusion for the time being... but among the 3 new faces including Leona's father Gaidell, the dev. team lacked one more member for the 8ketsu. What should we do?... And along came Ryuji Yamazaki to bail us out of our predicament. A snake charmer that even looked like a snake, he became a popular villain. He once humbled himself, joined up with the Fatal Fury team, and blended into the world of KOF more than we had predicted. The game planner at that time really knocked himself out to provide new moves for Yamazaki. Idea after idea got a short trip to the circular file (Attract opponent after Snake Charmer move; Seven Serpent Dagger Throw, etc.), and those failures led to successful moves like the Sand Sweeper.

About Blue Mary: Receiving the strong support of fans in a magazine's popularity poll, Blue Mary made her name known to the public, appearing in KOF from '97. Losing to Blue Mary in the popularity contest, as a matter of fact, was Duck King. This popularity contest truly decided the fate of these 2. From '97 to '03, Mary became a regular to the series for the staff. Duck, on the other hand, hit the skids, and he was relegated to cameos at the side of screens, in backgrounds, or as a Striker character. Doesn't this fleeting episode make you think about the impermanence of everything? Since the designer in charge of Mary preferred her outfit in "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory", she's kept that look until now. It seems to have worked.

About Yashiro Nanakase: Yashiro's team was created to offset the remaining top 3 characters. With the combination of their use of 3 elements-Kyo and Chris representing fire, Benimaru and Shermie signifying lightning, and Daimon and Yashiro standing in for the earth-the concept for Yashiro and his cohorts as rivals to the series' heroes was further emphasized. It also explains the battle of hairstyles (and bands, too) between Yashiro and Iori. In consideration to events going on in the world today, designers have expiated some of Yashiro's more wicked ending lines-such as, 'Execution, accomplished.'-and tossed them into the dustbin of game history. Incidentally, some of the production codes for his Super Special Move commands consisted of moves like the '260 Million Slams'. Some of his dumped moves included 'Human Surfing'.

About Shermie: Shermie is a glamorous girl who works as a fashion designer and plays in a band as a hobby. But in fact she is one of the 4 Orochi leaders who's adept at body slams. Come to think of it, she's quite an enigmatic character. The material for Shermie the 'Raging Lightning Flash' comes from L the Third. And even more trivia: the character of Yashiro comes from Bl.. G... Xa..gle and the character of Chris is derived from A.T. V...ms. The design for Shermie was easily decided on. Given her long bangs that will absolutely never reveal her eyes, she was called Tesse from "Waku Waku 7" at one time. Her hidden eyes burn with a homicidal glare it is said, but there's no material that reveals what her face actually looks like.

About Chris: Chris can kill with an innocent smile on his face-kind of a creepy personality trait, come to think of it (but he looks so cute, doesn't he?). To pull things together and bring the story concerning the leaders of the Orochi and the 8-ketsu clan to its climax once and for all in '97, a lot of story elements were forced onto Chris who became the vessel fort the Orochi (this actually began from the early stages of production). And there's a story behind Chris's Super Special Move line, 'Ripping the chrysalis, the butterfly flutters'.

About Orochi: At first, designers planned a rather extreme setting in which a buck-naked Chris battled with a glowing energy ball, but for better or worse went with the current design (A survey of the designers garnered a mere 2 votes for the design for a buck-naked Chris). Incidentally, his design codename was 'Chief'. A lot of people were against the name 'Orochi', too, but these days it has become a firmly established proper noun in gaming lingo.

About Orochi Iori: The powers that be, who created the stories for the boss characters to heat things up for the series with KOF '97, first decided to make the final boss an Orochi to conclude the series' "Orochi Saga". The stage bosses were an easy choice: the 3 remaining characters of the Four Orochi Deities. This was followed with the suggestion to make the final boss Iori, 'berserk with the Orochi blood rage'. So the 'Minor', 'Middle', and 'Major' bosses were decided, with the 'Orochi Iori' we know and love rounding off the quartet as the final boss. Because this character was originally designed as a player character at the time, he's designed to mow down the other characters with relative ease.

About Orochi Leona: If Iori appeared berserk with the Orochi blood, the other successor in the bloodline of the 8-ketsu Clan, Leona, was also destined to go berserk someday. That's how this character came about. But inexplicably the design team wanted to heat up battles against the computer. So various sequences such as televised broadcasts were added, and provided a turn of nail-biting events that sent players to a 'fork in the game' that would pit them up against either Orochi Iori or Orochi Leona in the end. But savvy players who knew how to get a character to appear would be able to select their particular routes.

About Kyo Kusanagi Version '94: Along with KOF '96 game system changes, Kyo got a new arsenal of different Special Moves, and the wielder of the 'Dark Thrust' was as popular as ever. And designers also added the KOF '94 version of Kyo Kusanagi to satisfy all our fans. Designers were apprehensive about returning to the old character design, but this all disappeared with the warm acceptance of fans.

About Shingo Yabuki:: The code name for this character in the early stages was 'Shingo Suzuki'. The plainness of his name conversely suited Shingo quite well, we thought, but what do you think ? He was originally based on Kyo with the concept of becoming a comic, everyday guy foil, but in spite of our intention to promote him simply and plainly, he was splashed all over the place and his silhouette appeared in pre-promotion campaigns in magazines, becoming an extensively hyped character. And his voice was supplied by the famous Japanese voice actor Taketo Koyasu. And one more thing, Shingo is a character who can't shoot flames. And probably never will.

The dialogue heard during the Title Screen music (4th Fire) goes as follows:
"They're back to the heat... For the answer they've long been searching for.
Is it their fate, or just a bloody coincidence? It shall be clear, as three powers will be as one...
Now, the fourth phase is about to begin!
The King of Fighters '97.
The story moves towards its violent destiny."

A hack of this game is known as "The King of Fighters '97 Plus" and allows you to play evil versions of Leona, Iori and the Orochi team plus Orochi himself.
Another hack is known as "King of Gladiator".

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'. 

Pony Canyon released a 2 CD limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '97 - PCCB-00273) on 20/08/1997.

The King of Fighters '98 - The Slugfest (c) 1998 SNK.

The King of Fighters '98: The Slugfest is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players, featuring 38 selectable characters. As with previous games in the series, players can choose between two different playing styles: Advance and Extra. 

* Extra is similar to "King of Fighters '94" and is more suited to defensive play, as the fighters only have one power gauge and cannot run. They can instead sidestep to avoid incoming attacks and can also perform unlimited super moves when their energy is low. 

* Advanced mode gives the fighters the evasive roll introduced in "King of Fighters '96" and lets them store up to three full power gauges at once. This means they can choose to expend a gauge to get a damage boost, rather than letting it happen automatically. It also allows fighters to use more than one gauge to inflict more powerful versions of their super moves (instead of having to wait until their health is low). Fighters can also expend a gauge to quick roll out of an attack after successfully blocking it.

Both the 'Extra' and 'Advanced' modes have been tweaked since the previous game. Unlike KOF '97, fighters will return to normal if they perform a Super Special Move in MAX state. Also, when a fighter loses a round, they are given a handicap in their favour. In Extra mode, the time it takes to charge their power gauge to its maximum level is shortened. In Advance mode, the fighter's stock capacity of Power Gauges is increased by one.

- TRIVIA -

Released in July 1998.

This game is known in Japan as "The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends".

It is said that this game is a 'dream match' for more reasons than one - this KOF is said to exist only in Shingo's dream - each character in this dream match was Shingo's impression of these characters, based on either personal experience or his notes in his notebook.

Yuri has a long record of taking movements from other characters, especially Capcom (see previous KOF entries). In this new opus: Yuri's new special attack 'Shin! Chou Upper' is a knock off of Ryu's Shin Shoryuu Ken. She also has a movement similar to Terry's burn knuckle. Finally, her Forward+A is a parody of Sakura's Flower Kick.

KOF98 contains pieces of music from older KOFs.
For example, the character select music when a second player joins in is straight from KOF 96 (it's called Roulette).
Here's a complete list of themes, the teams (or individuals) they belong to and the games they were taken from:
Esaka? (Japan Team): KOF 96 (Japan Team's theme music).
Esaka (95-style Kyo Kusanagi): KOF 94 (Japan Team's theme music).
Kurikinton (Fatal Fury Team): Fatal Fury 2 (Terry Bogard's theme music).
Art of Fight (Art of Fighting Team): Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki's and Ryuhaku Todo's theme music).
Rumbling in the City (Ikari Team): KOF 96 (Ikari Team's theme music).
Shin! Senritsu no Dora (Psycho Soldier Team): KOF95 (Psycho Soldier Team's theme music).
Fairy (Gals Fighters Team): KOF 96 (Chizuru Kagura's theme music).
Seoul Town (Korea Team): Real Bout Fatal Fury (Kim Kaphwan's theme music).
Bloody (New Face Team): KOF 97 (New Face Team's theme music).
Rhythmic Hallucination (Orochi Yashiro): KOF 97 (Orochi New Face Team's theme music).
C62 (Ryuji Yamazaki): Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Ryuji Yamazaki's theme music).
Blue Mary's Blues (Blue Mary): Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Blue Mary's theme music).
London March (Billy Kane): Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Billy Kane's theme music).
Arashi no Saxophone (Iori Yagami): KOF 95 (Revenge Team's theme music).
Arashi no Saxophone 2 (Mature, Vice): KOF 96 (Iori Team's theme music).
Slum No. 5 (USA Sports Team): KOF 94 (USA Sports Team's theme music).
Still Green (Shingo Yabuki): KOF 97 (Shingo Yabuki's theme music).
Ketchaku R&amp;D (Omega Rugal): first half from KOF 94 (Rugal Bernstein's theme music), second half from KOF 95 (Omega Rugal's theme music).
Ne! ('94 Gals Fighters Team): KOF 94 (Gals Fighters Team's theme music).

Also to note that the music that is played prior to facing Rugal (Kettou R&amp;D) is also from KOF 94 (as the theme for Rugal's first form).

When Choi Bounge appears, a 7 seconds sample from a song is played. This song is 'Choi Bounge Ondo', which appeared in the KOF 97 Arrange SoundTracks. The song became quite popular in Japan.

Mr. Big from "Art of Fighting" makes a small cameo appearance in the USA Wharf background, during the first rounds.

About Kyo Version 95: Because the introduction of different versions for this character included as "hidden features" in KOF '97 was such a hit with fans, designers thought, another version of Kyo in KOF '98 would make the game more inviting. Designers also remember that both versions for Kyo Kusanagi for game tests were equally popular. This concept for different versions of this character subsequently became the basis for the 'Kyo clones'.

In the Japan Street stage, during the second round if you look in the middle of the background where some shops are, you can see tiny moving people who look like Iori, Mai and Terry Bogard. In the third and fifth round, you can see two people doing hand signals, they look similar to Kyo Kusanagi &amp; Shingo Yabuki. In the fourth round, you can see Mai and Terry.

A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neo+geo bios s1 tile-set rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the main-board z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after game over, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

- TRIVIA -

Released on July 22, 1999 in Japan.

The Fatal Fury Team music theme is a remixed version of Terry's theme in "Fatal Fury Wild Ambition".

About K' (K Dash): K' initially sported a slicked back hairstyle, but this was nixed by the powers that be and that's how the 'hairdo' for the hero of the NESTS Chronicles got changed. The reason for his hair being bushier than need be may be a reflection of the conditions around him. "Garou - Mark of the Wolves" was being developed concomitantly with KOF '99, so the staff learned that MOW's main character (Rock) looked like K' (causing the supervising designer to lose a few pounds from panic).

About Maxima: With the growing influence of teenagers, it seems the concept for Maxima evolved from a desire to introduce a sober and reliable middle-age character (sad state of affairs though when a twenty-something male is referred to as 'middle-aged'). The designers were initially supposed to design a character that used body slams, but the finished character became a fist-fighter. Strange how things happen, isn't it? Maxima was originally modified by the male scientist Dr. Makishima, but in a serialized KOF comic that came out in Hong Kong, he, for some reason, became a 'beautiful woman doctor'. This comic is hard to get your hands on in other parts of the world, but check it out if you have the opportunity.

About Whip: The plan was to introduce this character in KOF '96, but since Leona was already a part of the Ikari Team she began her series of appearances in KOF '99. Since Leona exposes comparatively more skin, Whip sports less revealing but body-hugging fashions that leave a little more to the imagination. The number of dots used on Whip's whip were reduced to express a feeling of speed and power - a daring method of expression. The supervising designer was sweating bullets over this when the design was checked (he feared he'd be accused of slacking off), but in the end the concept was approved without incident. The designers hoped that she would be accepted as an independent, whip-brandishing character rather than just another member of the Ikari Team.

About Pao: Due to circumstances regarding the game structure, a new character had to be added to the Psycho Soldier Team, and various ideas for this additional character were formulated. Some of these included: 'a younger idol from Athena's agency'; 'a love rival pitted against Kensou', 'a mighty male character with a scary appearance but a heart of gold and a love of nature', 'an old woman who looks after Chin Gentsai', and many others. With the appearance of Pao, the average age of the Psycho Soldier Team dropped dramatically...or was supposed to, but things didn't actually change that much (it dropped from 42 to 34 years old).

About Li Xiangfei: When development began for KOF '99, the designers grappled over which character from Real Bout 2 to choose, Rick Stroud or Li Xiang Fei. Giving the reasons that a cute female character and a Chinese boxer was desired, they unanimously selected Li Xiang Fei. Needless to say, the designers who came to this decision were all men. Typical! With the actual execution of this, however, the designers struggled to bring the character into the KOF world without ruining her image created in the Fatal Fury series. As you all know Li's move names in the Japanese version are all derived from place names in Osaka, so the designers enjoyed the work of coming up with names following this rule when new moves were added. Moves like Eiki Shuho (Vanguard Blast, in English) and Daikoku-cho (Big and Ugly Ultimatum) give her twice the appeal for local fans...

About Jhun Hoon: The savior of Chang Koehan and Choi Bounge, an evil fighter who's Kim's alter-ego, a fellow disciple who looks like Kim - these were some of the concepts for Jhun, but as you can gather from the current character he's way different from what was planned. And since he's not an evil character, this naturally meant Chang and Choi would not be saved from their predicament; so, sadly, they continue to walk the slow and steady path to redemption that they've been walking these long 10 years. Jhun is also the first character in KOF history to adopt the concept of the 'pose'. Coming up and creating this kind of move really put the designers to the test.

About Kyo Kusanagi-1: Actually Kyo Kusanagi-1 and Kyo Kusanagi-2 were not scheduled to appear in KOF '99 at the time. Nor were Kyo or Iori Yagami supposed to either. Designers initially decided to leave them out because of the new storyline and wanted to focus more attention on the new character of K'. But for various reasons, designers came to the conclusion that designer couldn't leave these popular characters in limbo, so they got a reprieve (and a new wardrobe, too). Designers also felt the old Kyo dressed in his school uniform was necessary and hurried to include him in the game (See Kyo Kusanagi-2 for more details).

About Kyo Kusanagi-2: Production was reaching its climax when the idea for including various Kyos was hit upon... While the staff kvetched - "Should the design for Kyo in a student's uniform come from KOF '94 or KOF '95?"; "We don't have time to think this over!" - the project head said: "Make two designs". The staff objected timidly: "Are you nuts? We don't have time for that!". So the project planner remarked, "OK, then. I'll design them". Having hung up his character-designing clothes years ago, the head planner whipped up designs Kyo Kusanagi-1 and Kyo Kusanagi-2 in no time. Naturally, designers were blown away by his mastery and speed rivaling that of a street-performing sketch artist.

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as 'Real' Kyo Kusanagi or Iori Yagami (you need to get 'K.I' on the logo screen to be able to use Kyo or Iori).
1) To get 'K', you must use a team of 4 random characters consisting at least of three of these characters: K, Maxima, Benimaru, Shingo, Whip, Kyo-1 or Kyo-2.
2) To get 'I', you must use a team of 4 random characters consisting at least of three of these characters: Leona, Athena, Bao, Xiangfei, Kasumi, Kim or Jhun.
3) Then you must defeat Kryzalid and a screen will show you how to do the code.
4) For 'Real' Kyo Kusanagi, highlight the roulette selection box. Then, hold Start and press Left, Right, Up, Left, Down, Right. Kyo's picture will replace the sun symbol to confirm correct code entry.
5) For Iori Yagami, highlight the roulette selection box. Then, hold Start and press Right, Left, Up, Right, Down, Left. Iori's picture will appear replace the cresent moon symbol to confirm correct code entry.

* Fight Kyo Kusanagi or Iori Yagami: To fight Kyo Kusanagi or Iori Yagami you must: Choose one of the 7 full teams to battle with the computer. After clearing the 5th stage take note of your Battle Ability. Defeat Kryzalid. After finishing the Boss Stage, if the Battle Ability after the 5th stage is between 200 and 280 points Iori will appear. Otherwise if the Battle Ability is above 280 points Kyo will appear.

* Display character order: hold Start when selecting your character's fighting order.

* Select victory pose: press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.

* (BUG) The Power of The 'Ko'ou Ken': when using Takuma, activate the Counter Mode, then go to the opposite edge of the screen. Now, send a Weak (slow) Ko'ou Ken at the opponent and complete the movement for the special. The special will hit first and then the Ko'ou Ken hits the opponent in the middle of the attack. The opponent gets frozen even when it should be dizzy for the finish of the special.

* Finish the game using one of these combinations to see the special endings:
1) Kyo Kusanagi with anyone except Iori Yagami.
2) Iori Yagami with anyone except Kyo Kusanagi.

There is a different ending for some predefined Teams if Krizalid will be defeated while using a specific fighter:
1) Fatal Fury Team (Mai)
2) Psycho Soldiers Team (Kensou)

		<name>Kuri Kinton</name>
		<desc>Kuri Kinton is a side-scrolling beat 'em up arcade game published by Taito. Players control a Chinese policeman who must dispatch numerous enemies while progressing through the game's levels.

The object of the game is to rescue a senior policeman and his daughter, both of whom have been kidnapped by a gang and spirited away to an underground hideout.

The most interesting thing about this game is that it is freely (and not officially) inspired from two popular manga of this period:

Dragon Ball, for the main character aspect and powers (can throw kamehamehas and uses a sort of Kaïo-Ken).

Hokuto No Ken, for bosses aspect and technics they use.

Video game adaptations of these two manga were rare in 1988 (apart from NES and Master System), that's why the game was somehow (and is still) popular among a category of players.

The game received though a mixed response from games critics.</desc>

Last Hope - Pink Bullets (c) 2009 NG:Dev.Team.

The evil empire is rushing at light-speed across the galaxies, heading towards Mother Earth. Barely 24 hours ago, they penetrated the last defense line of our galaxy, the Arsion Laser Belt. Millions of innocent people perished in outer space colonies. 70% of our fleet was destroyed during first contact. Our intelligence has now extrapolated their arrival within six days. Conventional weapons cannot stop them. Our last hope is in your hands: The Z-42 Warpstar. Warp into their territories and destroy their leader before they reach Earth.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Multiplier: you can raise up your score by making use of two multipliers. The first is the Bullet Absorb Multiplier and the second is the Beam Chain Multiplier. The individual score value of each enemy you destroy does multiply by both multipliers. By absorbing enemy bullets you can increase your Bullet Absorb Multiplier. Additionally you can increase this multiplier by absorbing bonus containers and hidden special bonus items. By chaining enemies, with your full charge beam, you can increase your Beam Chain Multiplier. This Beam Chain Multiplier is decreasing by one point per second while you don't beam chain enemies, so be quick.

		<name>The Legend of Kage</name>
		<desc>The player is armed with a kodachi shortsword and an unlimited amount of shuriken. Grabbing a crystal ball causes the player's clothes to change to the next level in colour and thereby attain certain powers (bigger shuriken or faster speed); if Kage is hit while in green or orange clothes, he does not die but reverts to his normal red clothes. Grabbing a scroll causes Kage to stand still and meditate for several seconds while approaching enemies drop to the ground dead (although the scrolls appear in the arcade version, the crystal balls do not). The player takes role of the young Iga ninja named Kage ("Shadow") on the mission to rescue Princess Kiri (Kirihime) from the villains Yoshi (Yoshiro Yukikusa) and Yuki (Yukinosuke Kiri). Kage must fight his way through the forest, along the secret passageway, up the fortress wall and through the castle, rescuing her two times (three in the FC/NES version) in order to win the game. Each time the princess is rescued, the seasons change in the game.</desc>

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 41 years ago:

Lock'n'Chase (c) 1981 Data East.

Originally released as "Lock'n'Chase [Model DT-111]".

The game is a maze game. Like "Pac-Man", you're trying to eat up dots while four cops (with the names Spiffy, Smarty, Scaredy and Silly) try to stop you. While you don't have energizers to eat the cops with, you CAN block them off with walls (or better yet, try to trap them in the corners). When you're finished eating dots, there are two exits for you to escape from the cops.

The platform puzzle which first introduced Luigi to the world has both single and multiplayer action with two differing game types, but with the same objective. Crabs, turtles and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping underneath the platform they sit on, then kicking them away. Each level is cleared when a set number of coins is collected.

For the two player mode, the first to collect the set amount of coins wins.</desc>

SNK Neo-Geo MVS harware

- TRIVIA -

Developed by Noise Factory &amp; Atlus. Also licensed to SNK Playmore for manufacture and distribution.

Even if the copyright year shows 2002, this game was officialy released in public March 2003.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'True Gouketsuji Family Fighting Spirit - Matrimelee' ('Gouketsuji' is literally means 'Overpowering Blood Temple Family').

Known outside Japan as 'Matrimelee'

Some characters from the Power Instinct series received some minor name changes in this game:
Thin Nen =&gt; Chinen
Otane =&gt; Tane
Oume =&gt; Ume
Kurara =&gt; Clara
Annie =&gt; Anny
Pochi =&gt; Poochy

Also the transformation sequences from previous games has been almost completely ditched in this game (with the only exceptions of  super moves from Kanji, Clara &amp; Princess Sissy; as well as one of Tane's win poses).

While there have been a few fighting games that feature a vocal track as BGM (Roll's BGM in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes", Arina's BGM in "Waku Waku 7" &amp; Roomy's BGM in "Galaxy Fight - Universal Warriors" are but a few examples of this), the Japanese version of this game's BGM features an unprecedented number of excellent &amp; quite hilarious vocal tracks for many stages. Chinen BGM is nothing short of awesome!

Jones is the only selectable character from "Rage of the Dragons" that won't challenge you on the 3rd &amp; 5th battle. This is odd...

Abubo ("Rage of the Dragons"' sub-boss character) makes an unlikely cameo as one of Princess Sissy box surprises!

Kang Jae-Mo ("Rage of the Dragons" wrestler) makes a hilarious cameo in one of Jones' super moves.

Default highscore table (Ranking):
RANK SCORE NAME
1ST 0500000 PLM
2ND 0450000 ATL
3RD 0400000 MTM
4TH 0350000 NEO
5TH 0300000 GEO

Noise Factory released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Shin Gouketsuji Ichizoku Toukon - Matrimelee / Original Soundtrack) on May 01, 2003.

- UPDATES -

The US version of this game completely removed all the vocal tracks from the Japanese version and are replaced with the BGM of the "Rage of the Dragons" guest characters, causing those tracks to be recycled quite a few times. Such strange issue had already been seen in a few previous Neo-Geo games such as the Magical Drop games.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Enable "Rage of the Dragons" Characters: At the character selection screen, press Up(x4), Down(x3), Left(x2) and Right. The screen will go black and reappear with Lynn, Mr. Jones, Jimmy and Elias in the center of the character select screen.

* Play As Princess Sissy: After you choose your character, press and hold A+B+C+D until the match begins and you'll play as Princess Sissy.

Money Idol Exchanger (c) 1997 Face.

Handling money has never been so much fun! This incredibly original puzzle game lets you take control of  hilariously designed characters in a cute Japanese superhero theme and boggle your mind with a puzzle system reminiscent of the Magical Drop games but with a tricky-to-master coin handling twist. Good graphics with lots of funny animations (the intro is indeed a joy to behold!), cool pop music &amp; lots of challenge make this game a true gem to behold!

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-0231

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 2
=&gt; [A] Catch coins, [B] Throw coins

- TRIVIA -

		<name>Mortal Kombat</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 30 years ago:

Mortal Kombat (c) 1992 Midway.

Mortal Kombat, first in the Mortal Kombat series, is a 1-on-1 fighting game featuring a cast of seven different characters. Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom's seminal Street Fighter II, such as the game's special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against. 

Mortal Kombat characters list:
JOHNNY CAGE
KANO
RAIDEN
LIU KANG
SCORPION
SUB-ZERO
SONYA BLADE

Battles are fought over the best of three rounds. At the end of a battle, a voice instructs the winner to 'Finish Him/Her!' and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character's 'fatality', which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.

Mortal Kombat arcade runs on the Midway Y Unit hardware.

- TRIVIA -

Mortal Kombat was released on October 8th, 1992 in the USA. It was renowned as the first fighting game to use digitized characters and blood (as opposed to the hand-animated, more cartoon-like graphics of competing games). Mortal Kombat was developed as a reaction to the popular Capcom game "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", with simpler controls and digitized graphics. Some say the game's graphic violence was gratuitous, and was only included in order to generate a public outcry and controversy that would increase publicity for the game. 

Although highly controversial, the mix of realism and violence propelled Mortal Kombat to the height of popularity. An example of the game's innovations was the Fatality, a special finishing move executed against a dying opponent to create an even more gruesome death. For example, one character would grasp a defeated, wobbling opponent by the head, then rip the head and spine out of the opponent's body, which then crumpled to the ground in a pool of blood. Another aspect of gameplay that became a recurring element in games that followed was the so-called 'juggle', where a series of moves could be executed against an opponent who was kept in mid-air by the force of the attacks, and who hence had no defense against further attacks as long as the 'juggle' could be maintained. 

The original concept of Mortal Kombat was modeled after the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie 'Bloodsport', which is a cult classic martial arts film. The character of Johnny Cage is directly modeled after Frank Dux, Van Damme's character in the movie. Johnny Cage's film-star motif is an obvious link to this. Cage also wears the same costume (plus shoes) that Van Damme's character wore in the final battle of the movie. Cage's splits punch was originally seen in Bloodsport during the fight against the Sumo wrestler. Since Midway was unable to get Van Damme for this game, they kept the same kumite/martial arts movie concept and added the Kombat story. 

Mortal Kombat arcade was the first video game to have an official release date countdown in U.S./U.K. and Australia. This momentous day was known as 'Mortal Monday'. 

The code for this game includes the ASCII string 'NOOBSAIBOT' (originally in "Mortal Kombat II" rev. 3.1), suggesting that the character may have made his first appearance here, instead of Reptile (which took up less memory). 

The heads used in the background of the Courtyard and Pit stages are actually those of the programmers themselves! The statue of Buddha in the background of the Courtyard stage was actually a lawn ornament from a neighbor's yard. 

While fighting on the Pit stage, if you look closely at the glowing moon in the background, you will sometimes see a silhouette fly past it. These shadows will either be Peter Pan and the Darling children, a witch on a broomstick, a kite, a blimp, a rocket, a flying saucer, or Santa Claus in his reindeer-pulled sleigh. The shadows appear about every 6 games. 

Liu Kang is Midway's homage to Bruce Lee. 

Raiden really is the Japanese God of Thunder. His appearance in myth is quite different though: he has red skin and a demonic face, his feet have two claws on them, and he carries either a wheel or drums on his back. He also is thought to eat human navels so people are advised to lie on their stomachs during storms. 

Kano make an appearance on the 2012 animation movie 'Wreck-It Ralph' from Walt Disney Animation Studios.

In the Palace Gates stage, above the red door on the right side, you can see Pac-Man, a ghost and a power pellet carved on the stone. 

A hacked version also exists - every stage had a black/night sky and every time you got frozen by Sub-Zero, your fighter would rise up and stay there 'till you either got hit or the freezing effect went away. The same thing would happen if you were using Sub-Zero and froze your opponent. The machine would boot up just like a regular MK machine boots up, except another black screen with red letters and asterisks labeling it as "Mortal Kombat Black Ninja Edition" was displayed before the title screen. 

A Mortal Kombat unit appears in the 1995 movie 'The Doom Generation'. 

Midway released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Mortal Kombat II: Music from the Arcade Game Soundtrack - 123770-C1) on December 1, 1993. 

Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.

The Premium Pack and Kollector's editions of "Mortal Kombat - Deception" for the Sony PlayStation 2 and Microsoft XBOX, respectively, both released on October 4, 2004 in North America, contain a bonus disc containing an arcade-perfect version of the original game.

- TRIVIA -

Mortal Kombat 3 (MK3) was released in March 1995 in USA.

MK3 was the first Mortal Kombat game to have bi-level battlefields, which lets players uppercut their opponent to the level above them when fighting on certain levels. 

MK3 was also the first Mortal Kombat arcade game that did not include Scorpion, and, according to series co-creator Ed Boon, the last. 

MK3 also introduced the RUN button, accompanied by a RUN meter, allowing the character to run. This was primarily to address concern from fans who thought that the previous games gave too much of an advantage to the defending player. 

MK3 introduced the Kombat Kodes, which were 6 digit codes entered at the VS screen in a 2-Player game to modify gameplay, fight hidden characters or display certain text messages. 

MK3 also introduced the Ultimate Kombat Kode, which was a 10 digit code that could be entered after a game was over in single player mode. If the correct code was entered, Smoke would become a permanent playable character on the character select screen. The arcade owner, however, could reset this code by accessing the game's diagnostic menu by hitting a DIP switch within the MK3 cabinet. 

MK3 introduced the chain combos, also known as dial-a-combos (many other fighting games at the time had similar combo systems). These supplement the existing juggle combo system, but critics contend that dial-a-combos are redundant and needlessly add to the learning curve of the game. 

MK3 introduced the long-rumored Animality, where the character transforms into an animal in order to kill their opponent. 

MK3 also introduced 'Mercy', allowing a beaten foe to recover a sliver of life and continue fighting. This was necessary to perform an Animality. 

MK3 was the first game of the series to use distinct blood colors depending on the character; the human characters and Shao Kahn had traditional red blood, Sheeva, and Motaro had green blood, while the three robotic ninjas had black blood. 

MK3 was the first game of the series to have a playable Shokan character; Sheeva possessed unique corpse spirits (skeletons, etc.) that other player characters shared. 

MK3 was also the first Mortal Kombat arcade game to feature player-selectable difficulty; previous games' difficulty settings were set by the machine operator. 

It was the first Mortal Kombat game to feature Sub-Zero unmasked. 

The early names for the Graveyard and the Bell Tower stages were 'The Boonyard' and 'Tobias Tower', respectively, but criticism regarding the oversaturation of Boon's and Tobias' names in the game soon surfaced, resulting in both levels being quickly renamed with their generic descriptions. 

Many of the new characters weren't officially named till late in the production of the game. During production, Sektor and Cyrax's names were Ketchup and Mustard (respectively), due to their coloration, while Sindel bore the odd moniker of Muchacha and The Bride. Kabal, meanwhile, was nicknamed Sandman possibly due to Kabal's inspiration coming from the Tusken Raiders of Star Wars fame. At some point, it has also been rumored that Sektor and Cyrax are, in fact, Scorpion and Reptile, who were forced to transplant their souls from their original physical bodies into mechanical substance and act like a supreme clade of Outworld robot warriors. When "Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3" came out, these proved to be false. 

The Graveyard stage contains gravestones with the last names of MK3's entire design team: Ed Boon, John Tobias, Dan Forden, John Vogel, Tony Goskie, and Dave Michicich. For each round, four of these names will appear randomly on each of the four closest gravestones. Each gravestone also has each person's date of birth as well as the "alleged" date they died, which is April 1, 1995, the day the first version of MK3 was released in the arcades. A gravestone in the background can also be seen reading "Cage", making reference to Johnny Cage being deceased (at the time). 

Originally, the character Kurtis Stryker was supposed to appear in MK1, but was scrapped early in the development process when beta tests revealed a player interest in a female character in the game, which led to Sonya replacing Stryker. In MK2, Kurtis Stryker almost made it to the final game, but finally had his name changed to... Jax. For MK3, a new Kurtis Stryker is created and is finally made part of a MK game. 

The head that occasionally appears after an uppercut or combo and says 'Toasty' is the digitized head of Dan Forden who worked on the sound and music for the game. 

Smoke's icon is a version of Sektor's icon. 

Midway / Toasty Productions released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Musik: MK3 &amp; MK4 Arcade Video Game Soundtrack) on January 1, 1997.

		<name>Moon Patrol</name>
		<desc>A straightforward adaptation of Williams' cult arcade classic, Atari's Moon Patrol for the Apple II is a somewhat stripped-down, no-frills experience which concentrates on the action of the game, rather than getting the visuals or the sound right.

The game offers either joystick or keyboard control (and fair warning: the keyboard control scheme is nearly impossible). Moon Patrol manages to give justice to most of the visuals, though some of the graphic nuances -- the lunar cities in the background, the shading on the triple-sphere ships which lob crater-making bombs at you -- is sacrificed, probably due to the Apple II hi-res mode's limited color range. Completely absent is that jaunty little tune which accompanied the arcade Moon Patrol and even home versions like Atari 2600.</desc>

Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (c) 1996 Nazca.

A scrolling 'run-and-gun' platform game for one or two players, Metal Slug is a humorous parody of war and specifically of World War II and the Nazis.

The game features six enemy-packed levels, referred to as 'missions'. Players start the game armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons can be picked up and used for greater firepower. Also, at certain points during a level players will find an unused 'Super Vehicle-001' - or Metal Slug - tank which can be entered and driven. The Metal Slug is slow-moving but has very powerful weapons. If the Slug takes too many hits it will break down and start to flash, the player must then quickly exit the vehicle before it explodes. The enemy troops also have vehicles at their disposal, such as tanks, boats and helicopters.

The levels are littered with bearded hostages who, when rescued, award players with either points bonuses (in the form of medals) or weapon power-ups. Available weapons are Heavy Machine Gun, Flame Shot, Rocket Launcher and Shotgun. Hand grenades are also available.

Each level ends with at least one large enemy 'Boss' vehicle that takes many hits to destroy. Once the boss has been destroyed, bonus points are awarded for each prisoner rescued. Further bonus points are awarded if the player's Metal Slug vehicle has survived the boss battle.

- TRIVIA -

Metal Slug was released in April 1996. 

Etymology of 'Metal Slug': Meeher, the lead designer of the game for Nazca, wanted to create an armored fighting vehicle that could crawl on the ground like a 'slug'. The word 'metal' in the title indicates that the vehicle is mechanical. Initially, players considered the title to be "not good enough". Meeher later joked about the title, saying "Maybe I don't make much [sic] of a sense?" 

Slugs in Metal Slug sequels included animals (usually only the Vulcan cannon mounted on the animal, with a cannon attachment occasionally available), planes and other vehicles that did not fit Meeher's original definition. 

While being an obvious parody of World War II and the Nazi regime (the rebel army's flag is a deliberate pastiche of the Nazi "Swastika"), Metal Slug also lampoons 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'MASH'. General Morden, the rebel army's evil general, is a parody of Saddam Hussein. 

Just as the two main heroes (Marco &amp; Tarma) appear in every chapter in the Metal Slug series, General Morden &amp; Allen O' Neill (the machine gun wielding, trash mouth-talking, buffed soldier) are the series' classic main villains.

The tank in Metal Slug was inspired by the tank: Dominio Tank Police (1988). The tank in this anime is called Bonaparte and is piloted by Leona Ozaki.

Cliff Reese holds the official record for this game with 2,683,030 points on March 8, 2011. 

The same team that created Metal Slug had previously created a handful of games for Irem, most of which featured very similar graphics and gameplay. "Cyber Lip" (1990) had some of the core developers as the original Metal Slug. "Gunforce" (1991) and "In the Hunt" (1993) had noticeably similar gameplay, with graphics that bear a slight resemblance to Metal Slug. "Gunforce 2" (1994) not only had similar gameplay but the sounds of dying soldiers were almost exactly the same as Metal Slug. Because of this, some fans refer to Gunforce 2 as "Metal Slug Zero".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Metal Slug features a 'blood ON' option (soldiers squirt blood when shot, instead of water). This can be activated via the 'Setting The Soft Dip' option in the game's dip switch menu. 

* When you parachute into the level at the start of a mission, press B to make the parachute disappear, allowing your character to drop to the ground more quickly. 

* Don't waste ammo. Metal Slug requires some thinking and shooting indiscriminately is not the best way to play this game. 

* Don't waste special weapons on shields. Shielded soldiers will throw their shields aside when they need to fire, so shoot at them only at this instant. Or use your knife if you manage to get close enough. 

* Use your knife against lone enemies. There is no need to waste ten rounds of your Heavy Machine Gun on a single enemy soldier. 

* When Metal Slug is dangerously low on health (but not so low that you are forced to leave it), use the frontal attack to inflict major damage. 

* Whenever you jump out of the slug, you are invincible for a brief amount of time. This is especially useful against the blue mortars, since they can't be avoided. Note, however, that there is no period of invincibility when you jump back into the slug. 

* There is apparently no 'reload time' when you throw grenades or rockets. The rate depends on how many of either are currently on-screen so if you are close to an enemy, the rate will be negligible. You may use this trick against some bosses and in any other situation to pass through unscratched. 

* The best way to earn points in to rescue hostages, but this can be tricky. The first problem is finding them, the second is to stay alive to the end of the mission to get credit for your rescues. 

As well as the easily-spotted hostages that litter the levels, there are also numerous hidden hostages: 

MISSION 1 (hostages: 10): 

Two pairs of are hostages hidden in the two waterfalls just before you get to the boss. Just blast the tops of the waterfalls and they will fall. 

MISSION 2 (hostages: 12): 

Blast down at the green bush underneath the bridge just before you reach the mid level boss (large tank on rails above you) and three secret prisoners will come running in your direction. 

MISSION 3 (hostages: 15): 

There are secret hostages hidden within the two large trees that you can blast down in the section where you have the Metal Slug tank. These seem to be random, just try blasting those trees down and sometimes they appear. 

There are hidden hostages that drop down from the sky when you are fighting the end of level boss; just don't kill the boss until they have all appeared. 

MISSION 4 (hostages: 20): 

Just after you have got the Metal Slug tank at the beginning of the level, blast the ceiling of the bar just above the light/lampshade high up on the wall at the entrance of the bar. 

At the end of level bosses you can either blast in the top right hand corner of the cave to get three hidden hostages OR blast the far bottom left hand corner for three hidden hostages. It is not possible to get both of these groups. You can only get one or the other. 

MISSION 5 (hostages: 13):

Blast the first and second houses and two hostages will appear. 

Fire at the top of the first and second trees in the stage in between the shops and houses. The first tree yields three POW's and the second only two.

Blast the undercarriage of the end of level boss after it has lifted up on stilts to get three extra prisoners who also provide useful power ups. 

MISSION 6 (hostages: 25): 

At the beginning, shoot above you to find one prisoner. 

Destroy the big pack of rocks to deliver one POW. 

Blast the small white cloud above you just after the boat you are on has run ashore to get two hidden hostages. 

When you're out of the boat, go left in the water to find some points. 

POWs appear on screen during the fight with the final boss, if you shoot in the top right corner. 

* Beat the game in two players mode to view a different ending sequence.

Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001/II (c) 1998 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

The heroes of Metal Slug, Marco and Tarma, are called into action once again to take on the might of General Morden and his armies in this, the first of several sequels to the superb 1996 original. This time, however, Morden has acquired a number of powerful allies to aid him in his evil schemes, some of which are not even human. The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded 'Sparrow Squad', Fio and Eri.

Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor. The occasional moments of slowdown that blighted the first game are still present, however.

- TRIVIA -

Metal Slug 2 was shown at the 1998 AOU Amusement Expo show, in Japan. Then it was released in February 1998.

The game's alien enemies, together with the final battle and ending sequence, are a deliberate pastiche of the risible sci-fi blockbuster movie, 'Independence Day'.

On the parental advisory screen (US version), 'advisory' is misspelled as 'advisoly'.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Metal Slug 2 Original Sound Tracks - PCCB-00311) on 17/04/1998.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Rescued hostages are the greatest contributors of points. But you have to stay alive to get credit for your rescues (Once you complete a mission, you receive 10'000 pts for every POW).

MISSION 1, Deserts of Arabia: You are sent to control a loyalist force suspected of building weapons of mass destruction.
* The tallest tree after the 1st building contains lots of fruit and 3 hidden POW's.
* Palace: Shoot towards the right of the red banner to release 2nd lieutenant Hyakutaro Ichimonji. This mystic POW has an energy bolt which is powerful and homes in on anything you can shoot (this means structures as well; collateral damage). He'll help you until you finish the mission or die.
* You'll find the Camel Slug after the conversing Arabs. It comes equipped with a Vulcan but provides no cover against enemy fire. Like the Metal Slug, the Camel can run over enemy soldiers.
* BOSS 1, Harrier VTOL: Waves of swordsmen rush at you. Take them out before they get too close. After about 100 shots, 2 bazooka grunts open fire. Stay in between the jet exhausts. Aim for the engines as much as possible (You'll see and get 10,000 pt. for the 1st wing and 50,000 for the 2nd).

MISSION 2, Valley of the Pharaohs: Intelligence has indicated that the enemy army is using a secret Egyptian site to house military machinery.
* Use your gun to knock out an eye from the Sphinx (30,000 pts).
* Without hitting the explosive barrel, kill the Imperial Guards. Then, fire at the top right corner offscreen, for 3 POW's.
* If you stand next to the 1st and 3rd miners, they'll dig up some bonus items.
* Shoot at the top right of the support tower for a POW.
* Pyramid slope: A gem or 3 POW's are hidden at the top of the screen, right above the spot where the 1st mummy pops up.
* If you get a whiff of undead breath, you'll become a member of the undead, identifiable only by headgear. You'll be carrying only a pistol. Jumping is also quite a task. The flashing healing potions will turn you back into a human instantly.
* Near the door, get the POW's before clearing out the mummies.
* You'll catch up with Rumi Aikawa here. Shoot her for a healing potion or points.
* The eye hieroglyph before the special mummy hides a gem.
* Shoot the deceased explorer to make her give up a gem. Disgruntled, she'll give you the matching stick of dynamite.
* Jogging to the left, you'll see a few platforms to jump on. From the 2nd to the top, you can carefully jump over to the right. The long one holds 2 treasure chests. But don't stop here. Carefully jump on top of the cat statues. Shoot the chest open, which holds a magic lamp. If you are patient enough, a djinni will appear. Wait just a moment longer, and he'll grant a wish for riches. Starting from the moment the lamp is released, count the plumes of smoke and jump after the 5th one. Shoot above the right statue for another magic lamp.
* On the next level path (8th platform), the head of the hieroglyph holds gems. Shoot'em out!!
* If you let the mummy attack the explorer, you can destroy the new mummy for a gem.
* The twin-armed Slugnoid vehicle is located on one of the higher ledges of the tower of doom. The main cannon (C) fires downwards ((A)+(B) Swan Dive)
* BOSS 2, Iron Claw: Use your cannon and bombs. If you stay at the same altitude for a while, Iron Claw rears back and charges towards you. It won't fire while doing so, giving you time to get free hits in. When Iron Claw primes up, jump to the side ledges.

* BOSS 2 Freeze bug - Stop the nasty climbing! This original flaw give players an unfair advantage to eliminate Boss2 without any difficulty. Below is the following of how to activate. When the player standing on the platform which placed on the last chest, jump to the right edge of the next platform and fall to right lower platform immediately. The screen scrolls up and the boss emerges from the bottom of the screen. Instead of being killed as usual, the player is still there safe and sound ,while the boss freezes and do no climbing at all. At this moment, Just stay on the platform where you are and attack then it will be destroyed afterwards. The trick is also possible when riding the slugnoid or two players' game, but both player must do it at the same time.

MISSION 3, Supply Train: You've managed to catch up with an enemy train headed for a night shipment to the Far East.
* At the engine of the train, rescue the POW. Shoot at the smokestack from below to release 3 POW's.
* From the head of the engine, manage to clear more space with your jump to the next train for 50,000 pt.
* Use the Slug flyer which is equipped with a Vulcan that is limited in angular range.
* BOSS 3, Four Legger: While the boss is standing, jump to shoot at it. Everything except the flame-thrower can be avoided by hiding underneath its legs. If you still have the Slug flyer, stay on the left.

MISSION 4, Chinese City, Downtown: A platoon of enemy troops is stationed nearby. 
* Collect as much of the food as you can. Once you're fat, your weapons will cause more damage but you'll be slower.
* Most of the buildings can be demolished, revealing hidden POW's or bonuses. Some of the POW's can be reached by knocking down the building they're on or the one next to it.
* Right about where the monkey and fish are, jump into an opening in the walkway and find POW's and a diet shake.
* Sitting on a rooftop of the residential area is your Metal Slug.
* BOSS 4, Big Tank (kind of battleship): Only the cannons take damage during this battle. If using the Metal Slug, try for the lower cannons first. Use the houses and boulders to aim for the higher guns.

MISSION 5, New York: The townsfolk have been complaining about strange smells and sounds coming from the sewers. Intelligence confirms that a battalion is stationed inside, ready for an invasion. 
* Jump on top of any of the cars, firing downwards. The car will burst in flames, sending you into the sky to reach a lot of bonus items.
* At the end of the street, shoot at the fire escape of the last building for 3 POW's and into the tree for fruits.
* At the underground railroad, shoot into the top of the arch for POW's.
* As soon as one of the 4 trains approaches from the right, fire immediately.
After destroying each one, run to the right to regain any lost ground.
* After marker zero (0), the track bends from here. But before you shoot at the EXIT door, fire at the ceiling. There are 3 separate spots with hostages.
* In the sewers, you see a box with an arrow on it. Find the lever and press (A) to wind it. After 3 turns, an item will drop down with a weapon or bonus.
* BOSS 5, Nuclear Submarine: Surfacing from the sewer slime, the sub attacks with a lot of lightning balls and a thunder cannon. When you see double barrels pop up, prepare for some serious thunder. Fire the Vulcan and bomb it at the same time. 

MISSION 6, Siberian Shipyard: Far from Moscow, the rebel army has secretly established war factories and rebel headquarters.
* Mountainside: the sign with the arrow hides a POW.
* Midboss, Super Soldier: Fully recovered from his wounds of Metal Slug 1, he challenges you to another showdown. The horizontal shots can be ducked. Sometimes, you can knife him once and jump away. Take whatever shots you can in the meanwhile.
* In the submarine factory, after busting the tank, use the platform to release the hostage on the higher platform.
* Small platforms give you access to some of the prisoners on the top level, but it's easier to fight aliens on the lower platform.
* When the 2nd area is clear, turn the crank to release a Laser Rifle.
* 3 POW's are hanging at the top of the screen after the 3rd area.
* A POW is hidden on the short plank in the 4th area.
* BOSS 6, Battle Drone: Use the platform to the left whenever possible. When the rod is exposed, it will prime up for 2 seconds, then fire a bolt. Keep a constant fire when free from the Battle Pods. 
* FINAL BOSS, Mothership: Fear not the various grunts and tanks, they are here to help you. Try using them for cover. Aiming upward from anywhere will hit some section of the ship. The soldiers bring in a Metal Slug later in the battle, just unload it from the truck. After a long and ruthless battle, the Mothership withdraws.

Metal Slug 4 (c) 2002 Playmore Corp.

The popular series of side-scrolling action games continues, introducing all-new characters into the plot. The world is now trembling under the fear of cyber terror, as the birth of a deadly new computer virus threatens to snatch the main military system out of every country. The virus has been created by the terrorist group known as Amadeus, and must be stopped by the four main heroes in the story. They are: Marco Rossi, an army platoon leader; Fio Germi, a superior director of an Italian secret service; Nadia Cassel, a French regular army soldier; and Trevor Spacey, a regular army sergeant. In the game introduction, the team discover that Morden is still alive and probably behind Amadeus...

A research installation developing the next-generation of Metal Slugs is attacked by unknown forces and a disk containing Metal Slug secrets is stolen. Ordered to recover the disk, Marco and Tarma follow in hot pursuit. Meanwhile, Eri and Fio, investigating the Ptolemaic Army, a paramilitary syndicate active in archeological excavation, catch up with them at an ancient ruin, 'The Corridor of Fire'. The two try to storm and seize the site but are repulsed by the natives and giant Metal Slugs. This incident proves it was the Ptolemaic Army that stole the Metal Slug secrets. The military subsequently launches a second raid by the elite PF squad and Sparrows on the 'The Corridor of Fire' to recover the secrets and destroy the syndicate!!!

		<desc>Various characters from Capcom games and Marvel Comics compete against each other in this classic Vs. brawler from Capcom. Unlike its predecessors, it adds the ability to call out a designated helper character during gameplay.Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes is the fifth Marvel Comics-licensed fighting game by Capcom and the third game in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. In contrast to X-Men vs. Street Fighter and Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, the game features characters from numerous Capcom franchises such as Mega Man and Strider, rather than just Street Fighter characters. The game takes place within the Marvel comic continuity, as Professor Charles Xavier calls out for heroes to stop him before he merges with the consciousness of Magneto and becomes the being known as Onslaught, the final boss. The game was developed in late 1997 and first released in January 1998.</desc>

Ninja Combat (c) 1990 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited. 

The ninja castle must be invaded! After you defeat certain boss enemies, they become playable characters as well!

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-009

Players: 2
Control: 8-Way Joystick
Buttons: 3
=&gt; [A] Attack/Super Attack, [B] Jump, [C] Special

- TRIVIA -

Ninja Combat was released in July 1990.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

By holding the A button until the attack gauge reaches full and then releasing it, you can unleash a burst of magical energy that can affect many of the enemies on screen. However, this has an effect similar to what happens in Final Fight: when you use this power, it decreases some of your life gauge.

By pressing the C button and then the A button, you can perform a special somersault attack that can be used to knock down a couple enemies in a row.

Only the main 2 players, Joe and Hayabusa, can pick up special weapons like swords, hachets and maces. The other 3 players (Musashi, Kagerow, and Gembu), who become selectable after appearing as sub-bosses, do not. To let go of a special weapon that you've picked up, press the B button.

Ninja Commando (c) 1992 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.

3 ninjas are sent on a mission to stop a madman named Spider from trying to use a time machine to mess with history. The game is almost like a tongue-in-cheek reworking of "Time Soldiers", which Alpha Denshi made 5 years earlier, with ninjas as the protagonists this time.

- TRIVIA -

Ninja Commando was released on April 30, 1992.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

The more you press the A button repeatedly, the more firepower you'll produce.

Press the A and B button together to fire shuri-ken (star-shaped blades). Unlike the main firepower, which is only straight ahead, the shuri-ken can be fired in all directions by moving the joystick in the opposite direction of which you wish to aim (example: to fire to the left, move the joystick to right and vice versa). This is also the best way to deal with a few of the bosses here: for example, on the stage set in feudal Japan, there are two giant sumo wrestlers who appear as sub-bosses. The main firepower seems to only have minor effect on them, but the shuri-ken are much more effective.

The C button is for firing magical bursts of energy. One drawback is that, similar to "Final Fight" this can cause a little of your life energy to be drained, so it should be used very carefully.

- TRIVIA -

NeoGeo Cup '98 was released in May 1998. It was actually a hack of "Super Sidekicks 3" made by SNK themselves. His subtitle is a homage for "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory"

A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* View The Name List: At title screen hold A+B+C and press Start to begin.

* Each team has 0, 1, 2, or 3 strengths. It stands to reason that the best team will probably have 3 strengths, unless you like an  unusual combination like attack &amp; defense. Here are the 16 teams that have 3 strengths: Croatia, Nigeria, Italy, France, Holland, Brazil, Argentina, England, Germany, Spain, Denmark, Colombia, Mexico, Romania, Portugal, Yugoslavia

Neo Drift Out - New Technology (c) 1996 Visco.

Neo Drift Out - New Technology is a rally-themed racing game viewed from an overhead isometric perspective. Players choose to race in one of three Japanese rally-spec vehicles: the Mitsubishi Lancer, the Subaru Impreza and the Toyota Celica, with each car offering a different balance of Speed, Control and Body.

The game consists of a short practice stage, followed by up to six race stages, each set in its own location and offering different driving conditions. To progress to the next race, players must reach the current stage's finish line within a set time limit. Failure to cross the line in time results in game over. Each stage also featues a mid-way checkpoint that must be reached within a set time.

During a race, on-screen arrows advise players of upcoming corners and bends, and prompts warn them of hazards, these can include patches of ice, rocks, barrels, cones and ramps. Rival drivers also pose a hazard as they can ram into the player's car, causing it to spin out. Many stages include short-cuts and the six racing stages and their driving surfaces are:

Stage 1: European - Urban street stage
Stage 2: African - Savanna stage set in the African wilderness
Stage 3: Snow Land - Asphalt stage with patches of snow
Stage 4: Southern Hemisphere - Rocky cliff-based island stage
Stage 5: Scandinavian - Snow and ice-covered stage
Stage 6: Great Britain - Verdant forest stage

Ninja Master''s ～覇王忍法帖～ (c) 1996 SNK
(Ninja Master's Haoh Ninpou Chou)

Criminally overlooked and combo-friendly medieval Japanese fighter with great animation. Ten selectable characters and two end bosses.

- TRIVIA -

Ninja Master's Haoh Ninpou Chou was released in May 1996.

The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Supreme Ninja Arts Scroll'.

The main design, as well as some of the special moves of the character 'Karasu' seem to be quite inspired by the main character of the 1994 movie hit 'The Crow' which was in turn, based on the graphical novel of the same name by James O. Barr (Even the name 'Karasu' stands as the Japanese word for "crow"!).:)

The character 'Nobunaga' is based on the real Japanese warrior 'Nobunaga Oda' who, during Japan's medieval period, overthrew the Ashikaga shogunate and ended a long period of internal strife by uniting half of Japan's provinces under his rule. In doing so he paved the way for the reunification of the country under the Tokugawa shogunate in the following century. His merciless use of power as well as his skill as a military strategist made him one of the most powerful &amp; feared leaders in Japan. The image of him in the game as a warrior who wields the demons power may have been some sort of a criticism to his eager embrace of Western culture, religion &amp; technology.

The character 'Goemon' is based on Ishikawa Goemon, the most famous thief in Japan on the Edo era (about 400 years ago) known to steal large sums of money from bad people and give the money to the poor. In other words, he was Japan's very own version of Robin Hood!

The character 'Sasuke' seems inspired on Sarutobi Sasuke, a famous legendary ninja with a strong sense of justice created in Tachikawa literature at the end of the Meiji period. Another source of inspiration may have been 'Ninja Kamui' an old anime series whose main character Kamui was an incredibly skilled ninja who wanted to abandon his ways as a killer thus becoming a 'nukenin' (runaway ninja) and marked for death by his own clan that vows to pursue and eliminate him.

Nightmare in the Dark (c) 2000 Eleven / Gavaking.

A peaceful (yet creepy looking!) gravekeeper embarks on a night-shift battle against zombies &amp; other night dwellers in order to put an end to the grave robbing mystery before the local villagers panic! Features very nice graphics with cool backgrounds, great soundtrack &amp; pretty fun gameplay in the same style as "Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom", "Tumble Pop" &amp; "Zupapa!". The deceased must rest in peace, so be sure to remind them of this fact!:)

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.

Players: 2

Buttons: 3
=&gt; [A] Attack/Throw fireball, [B] Jump, [C] Attack/Throw fireball

- TRIVIA -

Released in January 2000.

This game runs on the Neo-Geo MVS but was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'KING'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Alternate Costumes: At the beginning of the game (work at the continue screen too), hold the folowing buttons and press Start to choose an alternate costume: A = Blue, B = Red, C = Green, D = Yellow, AB = Grey, CD = Purple, AC = Orange, BD = Black.

* Shoot the treasure chests with fire and they will churn out lots and lots of diamonds until they disappear. As long as you do not get hit, the diamonds will continue to go up in value until they finally reach 10,000 each. Grabbing the sacks will add multipliers (2X, 4X, up to 8X) that will further increase your score.

* There are many cracks in the wood/stone of most levels. Some of these will reveal a fireball that will make your shot fly all over the board. Experiment with throwing at different angles to find these hidden spots. Most will clear the entire board as the ball flings out of control.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 38 years ago:

Pac-Land (c) 1984 Namco.

Pac-Land is a horizontally-scrolling platform game set in the cartoon world of the game's title. A fairy has lost her way and needs Pac-Man to help her get back to her home of Fairyland. Pac-Man, with the fairy safely hidden beneath his hat, must run and jump through the colourful world until he reaches and enters the magical door to Fairyland. Upon being rescued, the fairy gives Pac-Man a pair of magical shoes for his trip back home. These enable him to jump wherever he wants, without the need for a platform to jump from. This effectively means Pac-Man can 'sky-jump' back home if he so wishes.

Directional buttons make Pac-Man walk left and right and it's possible to make him run by tapping the desired directional button twice. Pac-Man is pursued by his ever-present enemies in the form of five ghosts - Pinky, Inky, Blinky, Clyde and Sue. Pac-Man must avoid the ghosts and other deadly objects that populate the levels. As with previous games in the series, a small number of 'Powerpills' appear. Eating a Powerpill makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible and turns the ghosts purple and vulnerable to being eaten. On some stages, Pac-Man must use a springboard to jump over large ponds by leaping from the springboard and rapidly moving left and right while in the air.

The game's stages are called 'trips', with players able to start on any one of the first five. Each trip made up of four rounds (three rounds to reach Fairyland and one round to return home) with a short interval between each one. The objective in all trips is to get the fairy safely back to Fairyland then return home to Pac-Man's family. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right, avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. The journey home, however, scrolls right to left.

Each stage must be completed within a set time limit and if the player runs out of time before finishing a round, Sue (the purple ghost) will speed up considerably and kill Pac-Man. At the end of each round, players are awarded bonus points based on how much of the time limit remains. On each stage, cherries and other items can be collected for extra points. There are a total of 8 different trips in the game, totalling 32 levels. After the 8th trip, the 9th trip is a repeat of the 5th trip, with level 33 effectively being level 17, with an increased difficulty level.

- TRIVIA -

Pac-Land was released in August 1984 in Japan. The game took a little over a year to develop, which was pretty long for that time, but there was a break in the middle. The game was very successful.

This game was influenced by Hanna-Barbera's Pac-Man cartoon, which ran from 1982-84 in the USA. The character designs and music are taken directly from the show. The background music that plays during the levels is the same as the cartoon's theme song. 

The anime was not broadcast in Japan. So videos of the series were sent to the developers for inspiration. Namco developed a powerful hardware to have a visual close to the series and to be able to display elements in the foreground, which is also present in the series (trees that are displayed in front of Pac-Man, etc.).

It was Kishimoto's idea to allow the player to go back and fly. He programmed these elements without asking the planner first.

It was the planner who decided not to use a joystick, he thought it was easier / more fun to use buttons to vary the speed (Track'n Field may have had an influence on this).

Mark Mendes holds the official record for this game with 4,150,400 points.

- UPDATES -

The Midway version allows the player to start on any one of the game's first five 'trips', whereas the Japanese version starts only on the first stage. Also, the gameplay in the Japanese set is much slower than that of the Midway set, making for an easier game. 

The Japanese set also has some minor graphical differences to the Midway version. Pac-Man's nose is longer, and the hat he wears has a feather in it. Also, when Pac-Man completes a stage and returns home to his family, only Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man are waiting to greet him. Chomp-Chomp and Sour Puss, the pet dog and cat who appear in both the Midway sets and the cartoon on which the game is based, are both missing.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Round 1 - Jumping on the first three fire hydrants to generate five cherries is quite safe as you don't have any cars until after the third hydrant. Continuing, you can see another fire hydrant just after the Pac-Pill. Straight after getting this, you can push the fire hydrant backwards, getting a helmet. This enables you to collect the babies that the ghosts throw from their planes (you lose your hat if you run out of time or die).

Round 2 - The Forest: The first 'cheat' is achieved by pushing the second cactus back -  giving you 80,000 points and transporting you to your house at the end of level two. If this doesn't work, then try the second, third, and fourth logs in the woods. The machine randomly chooses one of these (pushing the logs only works if you haven't died and you have 15,000 points). Get the cherry that appears as it turns into another three.

Round 3 - The mountains: These have no cheats, but watch out for the plane that always flies over the first mountain. (A flower sometimes grows here and in many other places, I am sure that this means nothing.) After completing the mountains, you pass two cacti. Pushing the first one back, on earlier versions, makes you invisible and invincible to everything except the water (which just happens to be the next obstacle!) To jump over the water, run at full speed over the spring board, and at the edge, press jump and keep on whacking the joystick to the right - you should glide over the pool! You have then reached Fairyland! Here the Queen gives you a gift of magic boots that enable you to fly. You then start Round 4 going back the opposite way.

Round 4 - Journey home: You first encounter cacti that you must jump over. If at any point you see the letter 'S' in a Pac bubble flying about, get it - it's an extra life. There is also another letter in a Pac bubble that flies around the screen - the letter 'L' - this can be achieved after getting a Pac-Pill, getting four ghosts and then Doris fifth (Doris is the one that chases you and the only one that has no hat after eating a Pac-Pill). The last cactus that you jump over is very tall. Try pushing the lower section of it backwards as this generates seven balloons, six of which are worth 100 points but one is worth 7,650 points. Get this and don't bother with the others. Continue going home once you reach the town, jump on all fire hydrants as this always generates cherries. If pushing the cactus back didn't do anything, then try pushing the second to last fire hydrant back - this will generate the balloons. When you arrive home, you can still jump to get 7,650 points.

Round 5 - The Town: Jump on the fire hydrants to generate cherries. Push the third hydrant back to give you the hat. If you pass two fire hydrants on top of each other, then jump on top of these. The blue things that push you along (water jets) can also push you on top of the houses. This is advisable as it keeps you away from any double decker buses! If the second fire hydrant didn't give the helmet then the fourth fire hydrant along will.

Round 6 - The water pool area: You have two short(ish) pools to clear, followed by more ghosts on pogo sticks (here appears another floating cherry). The last pool is the longest of these and must be judged carefully to clear.

Round 7 - The water jets: You have three different platforms to jump on. Always try to stay on the highest one. If a flying water jet happens to hit you then whack the joystick everywhere and press fire as it is possible to escape. Not much on this round, just collect loads of strawberries. After this you reach fairyland again, you receive the boots again, and have to return home.

Round 8 - The trip home: Firstly, you have to cross the long pool - backwards. Jump to the top of the screen straight away to get the cherries and clear the planes. There are stumps sticking out that you can land on and get cherries. After this there is the forest to complete. The first or second to last log will give the balloons. 

Round 9 - The Water Pool Area: You leave your house and go straight into the water pool area. There are three cacti on this round. Pushing either the first (before the pool), second (before the skeleton) or third (before the Pac-pill) back will give you the helmet. The pool is slightly different as it has a stump sticking out of the water that has an extra spring board you can land on. After this there is a skeleton (that drags you down into the ground) and must be jumped over.

Round 10 - The forest: Pushing one of the logs back will make you invincible to the ghosts. This works even if you have died. When you start flashing, the invincibility is about to wear off.

Round 11 - The logs and clouds: Much like the one on Trip 1 except after jumping the logs, you have to jump onto clouds (although not essential as Pac can clear all the cloud jumps in one). After this you reach Fairyland yet again and you receive the boots.

Round 12 - The trip home: First collect the three cherries. Then you have to jump backwards over a large pool - with no stumps. After this you reach the town. One of the few fire hydrants gives the balloons.

Round 13 - The Town: This level has many double hydrants. Jump on these and wait for the water jet to push you up onto the houses. Walking along the houses gives you some cherries. On many versions there is no helmet on this round.

Round 14 - The cavern: You have to collect the keys to open the doors. The first key is on the top layer. Jump up there to get it. Keep going right and fall down the hole. Keep going right and fall down the next one, too (you should now be on the bottom layer). Keep going right (staying on this level) and open the door. Keep going right. Jump up through the next hole and get the apples. Continue right, fall down the hole and get the key. Use this immediately to open the door. Keep going right, do not jump through the first hole and stay on the lowest level. You can then get two apples, jump through the hole and get a key, and then fall through another hole to get another two apples. Continue right and after opening the door, jump through the holes to get from the bottom level to the top. Open the door you reach and go through. Fall through the next two holes (so that you are back on the lowest level). Open the door you reach and get the two apples. Return through the door you've just come through, jump to the middle layer and continue right. You will now be out of the cavern and have reached 'break time'. So long as you don't waste time and keys it is actually easy.

Round 15 - The water jets: I think that pushing one of these fire hydrants may give the helmet, but I'm not too sure. Watch out for the planes at the very end of the level. Try to jump on them.

Round 16 - The trip home: The first gives the balloons. Next it's the mountains. There is normally an extra life lurking around the second mountain so go backwards once for it if it doesn't come (an 'S' in a Pac). Then it's the forest. The first log encountered gives the balloons if the cactus didn't.

Round 17 - A forest level: On some versions of the machine the very first cactus will give the helmet. Just before the water is a Pac-Pill and it is quite easy to get the time bonus. After the pool, there is a short forest, following that is a spring board that must be used to clear a second pool that cannot be seen from that point.

Round 18 - The cavern: You only have limited sight. The first key is on the lower level. Go right, then jump up to the middle level, then jump up to the top layer. Keep going right and fall down a hole to the middle layer (you'll be in between two doors). Jump back up to the top level (making sure you don't open either of these). Once back on the top level, keep going right and you'll reach a door. Open it and get the key directly behind. Keep going right, fall down to the middle layer, get the key, fall down to the lower level, and collect the fruit. Open the door you come across. Don't jump through the next hole, but through the one after that. Jump to get the key (fall straight back down again). Keep going right. Jump up through the next hole, go right, and fall down the next. Open the next door (you're still on the bottom level) and jump through the next hole. Then jump up to the top level, open the door and get the fruit. Go through on the top and open the end door. Fall through the holes and go to the bottom level. Go right and collect the fruit there. Finally, go to the middle level and exit to 'Break Time'.

Round 19 - The mountains: Clear these and the clouds as usual, but watch out for the planes at the end (over the part with three sets of moving logs). Enter Fairyland.

Round 20 - The return home: This is very easy. Keep on going left, You first hit a forest. Watch out for the ghost near the end. This is followed by a pool, get all the cherries on the way, but DON'T stop for anything. Then you reach another forest, then another pool, then the last forest (watch out for another ghost here) and then the town. By the time you reach the town you will be out of time and must run full speed from Doris. Try to get the Pac-Pill but if you miss it, don't go back for it!

Round 21 - The town: This is hard as there are so many ghosts. It is pointless jumping onto the double hydrants as getting on top of the houses may involve hitting a plane. Try to stay on the top of the double-decker buses, jumping from one to another. This will stop you needing a run up. The Pac-Pill at the end can only be got by first jumping onto a ghost. Don't bother with it unless you are already on a ghost. Go straight for 'Break Time'.

Round 22 - The mountains: As well as the clouds, you meet a new section - four logs in water that must be jumped onto and crossed. Careful judgment is needed here. Get the Pac-Pill afterward as you'll need it. Time is short so don't stop for anything.

Round 23 - The water jets: This gets hard towards the end as there are many ghosts around. Try to stay on the planes. You then reach Fairyland.

Round 24 - The trip home: First are the water jets to cross. This is quite easy as there aren't many ghosts and enables you to collect a lot of fruit. Then you enter the town. The last part of this is very hard. Just jump for the Pac-Pill when you see it and hope you get it before you are killed! Don't wait around.

Round 25 - The woods: There are two woods split up by lots of skeletons. DON'T use the spring board or you will hit one of the planes. All of the skeletons are fake apart from the first and last. So don't worry about touching them. When you enter the first wood, look for the helmet at the fourth log. I think it is hidden in there.

Round 26 - The mountains - again!: This time you don't have many logs to jump on and there are very few clouds. Most of the mountains have to be jumped without any clouds. This level also contains the logs in water and is the furthest that I've ever got.

* The appearance of special items in Pac-Land is NOT random. The position in which they appear depends on the last two digits of the player's score when starting a round. The table below gives the position of the obstacle which needs to be pushed to reveal the secret. In the table, R stands for Round No., F for feature (H=Helmet, W=Warp, T=Transparency, B=Balloons). The relevant obstacle number is given in each column for each score. For example, when first starting a game, the last two digits will obviously be 00, so the helmet appears by pushing the 4th hydrant. If, on the second round, the player starts with e.g. 20,020 points, then the warp will be hidden in the 2nd tree stump and so on. Some rounds have no hidden items. Now, when running from left to right, the obstacles are counted as the player meets them, BUT for return journeys (right-&gt;left), the numbering is different, only the LAST four obstacles are relevant. For example, on Round 4, Obstacle 1 is the last large cactus the player meets, Obstacles 2, 3, and 4 are the three hydrants in the town (numbered from right to left). All obstacles must be pushed in the opposite direction that Pac-Man must run in to reach his goal.

*There is only one obstacle on Rounds 11 and 12.

The helmet gives protection from falling monsters, and gives points for every one collected. The warp only appears on Round 2, and warps the player to Trip 3 and awards 70,000 points. Transparency makes Pac-Man invulnerable to ghosts, and balloons give points. Six balloons are released, and usually five of them are worth 100 points, and another 7,650 points, BUT if the last four digits of the player's score are 0000, then ALL 6 balloons will be worth 7,650 points.

There are no hidden items on any Round on Trip 8, and Trip 9 is the same as Trip 5, Trip 10 the same as Trip 6 and so on, repeatedly (can anyone confirm?).

Puzzle Bobble (c) 1994 Taito Corp.

Puzzle Bobble is an arcade puzzle game offering either one or two-player competitive play, in which the aim is to clear each play area of the coloured bubbles clustered in the upper half of the screen. 

This is achieved by firing bubbles up the screen - with the angle of trajectory dictated by the player - at the clusters of bubbles. The aim is to forms chains of like-coloured bubbles, making them disappear. At regular intervals the 'ceiling' of the play area - together with any bubbles stuck to it - will drop one row down the screen, decreasing the size of the play area making life more difficult for players. The game is over when the bubbles reach the very bottom of the play area.

In the single-player game there are thirty-two rounds to complete. In the two-player 'versus' mode, the winner is the player who clears their arena first. Both players have an identical arrangement of coloured bubbles in each arena and when a player removes a large group of bubbles (four or more), some of them are transferred to the opponent's arena.

Bubbles will fire automatically if the player remains idle. After clearing the arena, the next round begins with a new pattern of bubbles to clear.

- TRIVIA -

Puzzle Bobble was released in June 1994. it was the first in the hugely successful puzzle series from Taito.

The game was originally called Bubble Buster. The Bubble Buster title screen is buried in the game itself.

This game is known in US as "Bust-A-Move".

This game was re-released 6 months later (December 1994) on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware as "Puzzle Bobble [MVS]".

As well as typically cute Japanese animation (Bub and Bob from "Bubble Bobble" operate the cannon) and music, the game's mechanics and level design were beautifully balanced, and the game was terrifically successful at the arcades, spawning several sequels (see Series section for more information). It is unusual in being popular with women and girls.

If you look closely at the bubbles, you'll notice that the enemies from Bubble Bobble are trapped inside; a different enemy for each different colored bubble. The following chart shows which enemies are trapped in which color bubble:
Legend: Color of Bubble =&gt; Bubble Bobble Enemy Inside
Blue =&gt; Zen-Chan
Yellow =&gt; Pulpul
Red =&gt; Invader
Green =&gt; Drunk
Purple =&gt; Monsta
Orange =&gt; Banebou
Black =&gt; Hidegonsu
White =&gt; Mighta

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'AAA'.

During the credits you can see one of the constellations form the image of a fish, that fish is a boss from the "Darius" series; also made by Taito.

According to Twin Galaxies, the official electronic scoreboard, Kim Korpilahti holds the official records for this game with 16013660 points (difficulty 6) on November 6, 2004.

Zuntata Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Puzzle Bobble Variety - ZTTL-0009) on July 6, 2008.

		<name>Pocket Gal</name>
		<desc>Pocket Gal is a pocket billiards video game originally released into arcades by Data East in 1986.
The primary play mode, called "Pocket Game", is a straight pool game set within a limited number of lives; the player must achieve a predetermined score to advance through four or five levels, each with increasing number of balls. The player earns points by potting balls, potting balls on consecutive shots, and potting balls in numerical order. On occasion, a flashing star appear in a pocket, and if the player pots a ball into that pocket in the same shot, a bonus will be awarded in the form of points, extra lives or a bonus round. One life is lost if the player scratches or fails to pot a ball in two consecutive shots.

In the two-player mode, the player can choose between Pocket Game or 9-Ball Game. In two-player Pocket Game, the game plays similarly, except the two players take turns and there are no lives; if one player misses or scratches, control of the ball simply changes to the other player. In 9-Ball Game, each player have three lives and one life is lost if a foul is committed. However, the lives will be restored if the player pots a ball on the next turn.</desc>

		<name>Gogetsuji Legends</name>
		<desc>Known as Gogetsuji Gaiden: Saikyou Densetsu (豪血寺外伝 最強伝説) in Japan. This installment lacks the Power Instinct title in its localization; this would be a trend for the series in its subsequent western releases, officially phasing out the Power Instinct branding. The game's story picks up from the last game, with Otane being defeated by Kanji Kokuin, who became the new leader of the Gouketsuji clan.

This game is a sort of "update" to Power Instinct 2. All previous characters reappear, plus a few new characters. Super Kurara and Pochi are individual characters; because of this, Kurara and Kinta lost their transformations but gained new moves to replace them. Otane is also made playable. There is one new playable character, Kuroko, and a new playable boss, Chuck, bringing the cast to 16 characters.

The battles are in teams of two characters, a leader and a partner. This plays out similarly to The King of Fighters, where you fight with each character one after the other. A Super Block and a Charge Attack were brought into the gameplay. A Super Block can nullify the opponent's blow and allow for a counterattack, and a Charge Attack can immediately knock down the opponent or launch them into the air for another attack. All of the characters were given new special attacks, though the majority of them were exclusive to this game.</desc>

Pochi to Nyaa (c) 2003 Aiky.

Pochi to Nyaa is a cutesy puzzle game where the objective is to match the colored invaders in chains much in the vein of the Sega game "Puyo Puyo Fever". Pochi to Nyaa features three different modes of play: story mode, vs. computer mode, and two player vs. mode.

Story mode is a bare bones, single player game with three difficulty settings. The player works to build up chains in order to gain more time to play in one endless level. Once the timer runs out the game is over.

Vs. Computer mode is more of a real story mode where the player takes on the role of the novice wizard Prim, who has foolishly been lured into the "Pochi and Nyaa Tournament" by the promises of pudding. Before each battle Prim engages her opponent in a brief dialogue in order to advance the storyline. The player advances to the next opponent after winning one round. If the player loses the round then it is game over.

Vs. Player mode is a standard two player battle mode and begins with a character select screen.  After the characters are selected there is a short dialogue to introduce the players' characters and then the battle begins. Whoever wins two round of gameplay is the victor. Unlike many other two player games, Pochi to Nyaa vs. mode is played on one credit and so once the winner is announced the game is over.

In both single player mode games there is a brief introduction to the gameplay to assist the novice player.

- TRIVIA -

Released in December 2003.

The game is known outside Japan as "Pochi and Nyaa".

'Pochi' is a common name for a 'dog', and 'Nyaa' is the typical sound for a 'cat', so the title translates as 'Puppy and miaw'. The title is a pun: there is an extra char, so it can be read as 'Pochitto Nyaa', and Pochitto is the sound for a button quickly pressed.

This game was out first out on the Sega Naomi hardware in 2002, and was ported to the SNK Neo-Geo MVS at the end of 2003 (but was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console).

As a result, there are many who seek control the clan and the family fortune. Some train endlessly building up their strength, others polish up their fighting skills with experience, and still others concentrate on their fighting spirit, all for control of the clan. Because there were so many fighters vying for control of the clan, Oshima, the 3rd Goketsuji Leader, declared the following to all: The clan will hold a fighting tournament every 5 years. The winner of this "test of strength" tournament will assume immediate control of the Goketsuji clan until the next tournament, at which time the seat for control will be open once again.

Pulstar (c) 1995 Aicom.

Pulstar is a sideways scrolling shoot-em-up set in the year 2248, in which the first recorded sign of alien life is discovered on Mars. A signal emanates from the red planet and from it an object is observed travelling at light-speed out of the Solar System. Earth scientists are wary of what this could mean and warn the world's defenses to prepare for a possible attack.

Eight years later, an alien fleet follows the signal and begins attacking the human space craft awaiting them in Neptune's orbit. The battle spreads throughout the Solar System and within two years Neptune is destroyed, Jupiter is turned into a star and more than half of Earth's continents disappear from rising ocean levels and the planet's changing axis as a result. Kaoru Yamazaki, lone fighter pilot of the Dino246, is one of the few survivors of the Pulstar attack force, founded to save the Solar System from the alien invaders.

Pulstar borrows many of its visual and gameplay elements from all three games in Irem's legendary "R-Type" series, including the Beam weapon and R-type's infamous pod attachment. Unlike "R-Type", however, Pulstar's pod cannot be detached from the front of the ship and merely acts as a shield to protect the player's ship.

The game includes a weapon power bar which consists of two halves. The right-hand side of the bar turns blue when the fire button is held down and when released, it delivers a devastating beam of energy. The left-hand side turns red when the fire button is pressed repeatedly in quick succession, shooting out a barrage of smaller, rapid blasts.

Pulstar consists of eight challenging levels, with the player able to start the game on any one of the first four.

		<desc>Oume Goketsuji, Leader of the Goketsuji clan for the last 60 years, finally was defeated by her younger sister, Otane, the day where she surpassed her older sister finally had arrived.

One night, Oshima Goketsuji unexpectedly appeared in front of Oume and offered her help to take revenge of Otane.

According to the rules of the clan, if the leader dies or quits, one new tournament should be held immediately to find a successor.

That same night Oshima and Oume sent their servants to dispose of Otane, so while Otane slept, she was kidnapped and thrown to the ocean.

Next day Kuroko found a letter supposedly written by Otane, where she declined to her right to be the leader of the clan.

One week later all the competitors from the previous tournament and other family members were convoked to be informed about Otane's decision and the beginning of a new tournament.</desc>

Real Bout Garou Densetsu 2 - The Newcomers (c) 1998 SNK Corp.

23 of the finest South Town fighters in the 7th installment of this SNK game.

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-240

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 4
=&gt; [A] Punch [B] Kick [C] Power Attack [D] Move Between Planes

- TRIVIA -

This game was shown at the 1998 AOU Amusement Expo show, in Japan. it was then released in March 1998.

The title of the game translates from Japanese as 'Real Bout Hungry Wolf Legend 2'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 - The Newcomers'.

Things that changed in this particular game:
* The game now features 'single plane' stages (like the ones seen in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", "Fatal Fury 2" &amp; "Fatal Fury Special") in which you can slam enemies against background objects!
* The breakable objects system seen in Real Bout Special is gone. Also the "evil character" versions of some characters are gone as well.
* Newcomers in this game are: Li Xiangfei, Rick Strowd &amp; Alfred.

A serious bug: Using a USA bios ROM if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tile-set rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the main-board z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after game-over, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Real Bout Garou Densetsu 2 The Newcomers / PCCB-00310) on April 17, 1998.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Fight against Alfred: Begin game play in single player mode, finish off the first 10 fights with no losses, score over 750000 by the time the 10th fight is won, land 5 P.POWER moves or 7 S.POWER moves. You will fight Alfred in a desert type stage.

* You may scope out each character's best records by tapping A button to move forward or B button to move back at the score ranking screen:).

		<name>Return of the Invaders</name>
		<desc>Return of the Invaders is the third game in Taito's Space Invaders series. It's a more radical change from the original concept than Part II and features an all new full colour look. There are several new features in the game. Most noticeable are the additions of new enemy formations, seen already in the first wave where the aliens circle around. Some aliens also, when shot, leave their positions and dive towards the player. Others can reflect the player's shots and send them back against him. The game also adds bonus stages similar to Galaga. Another new addition is that the UFOs at the top of the screen now carry weapon upgrades which they drop when shot. To get it the player needs to avoid shooting the centre of the UFO as both the UFO and the weapon will be destroyed.</desc>

RoboCop - The Future of Law Enforcement (c) 1988 Data East.

RoboCop is a single player horizontally-scrolling platform shoot-em-up based on the 1987 movie of the same name. The game's story mirrors that of the film, with former city cop Murphy, now a half-human cyborg called 'RoboCop', on a mission to bring down the evil OCP corporation that created him.

The game features nine levels of action. Seven of these are platform-based stages that comprise the main game, with the additional two stages being into-the-screen target ranges. The ranges are effectively bonus stages, in which players accrue points by shooting as many targets as possible within a time limit. Additional player health is then awarded depending on the amount of points earned.

In the platform-based stages, wooden crates and barrels occasionally bar RoboCop's progress, these can be punched to remove them. Robocop is armed with an infinite-ammo machine pistol, but one of three weapon upgrades can be found hidden inside marked wooden crates (or occasionally dropped by defeated enemies). The three possible upgrades are; Three-way Gun, Dual Laser or the incredibly powerful Cobra Gun. The power-ups have only a limited number of shots, however, with remaining shots displayed in the upper-right corner of the screen.

As well as weapons, small jars of baby food can also be found (again, mirroring the movie) that when picked up, will restore some of Robocop's health.

During the game, Robocop will occasionally come across a criminal holding a girl hostage. He must kill the criminal without killing the hostage, otherwise some of Robocop's health is lost. The criminal will periodically duck while firing, Robocop must also duck but to avoid killing the hostage, must only shoot while the criminal is ducking. 

The film's incidental music plays throughout the game and RoboCop's speech is sampled directly from the original film.

- TRIVIA -

RoboCop was released in November 1988. 

After Ocean Software secured the RoboCop license, they sub-licensed it to Data East who created the coin-up game. Ocean then ported the game to various home computers. 

Most of RoboCop's sounds were borrowed from "Heavy Barrel". 

A Robocop Cabinet can be seen in the Nickelodeon shows All That (from 1994 to 1997) and Kenan and Kel. However both shows shared the same cabinet, but with different fictional marquees. 

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (G.S.M. Data East 1 - D25B1002) on June 21, 1989.

- UPDATES -

The bootleg version does not use the HuC6280 @ 1.342325 Mhz:-)

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

The following cheat for RoboCop can earn (theoretically) infinite scores: There exists a level in the game (the Junkyard), where there is an elevator. It's just after you get the Cobra gun. Anyway, you get on the elevator and ride to the top. When the elevator reaches the top, DON'T MOVE! Your score will suddenly start to increase, and will continue to do so until you step off the elevator.

Bad guys come onto the screen when you pass a certain pixel. Move back and kill them off; don't charge through the game. Learn the enemy movement patterns as they are the same in every play.

Here are some strategies for each level: 

* LEVEL ONE: The motorbike which damages you before you draw your gun can be beaten by jumping just before it comes on the screen. A shop window has a small menu type poster in it; jump around about there. When you land, punch the bike (it flashes green and doesn't damage you). Punch it when it returns to kill it.

When fighting the ED209, time your jumps until just AFTER it has fired at you, allowing you to jump over its shots. When it moves to the left third of the screen, stand close to it. RoboCop's weapons arm will now point at a steeper angle (more into the ground). Now move away slightly and jump away when ED209 fires. Its shots will go into the ground and not trap you at the left edge of the screen.

Another approach allows you to defeat the ED-209 almost instantaneously: First, make sure you still have the Three-Way Gun (not essential but makes things a little quicker and easier), then as soon as you clear the area of enemies the music will change and the ED-209 will growl. Simply walk to the right side of the screen (Before ED-209 enters) and fire repeatedly diagonally up and right. If done correctly, the ED-209 will come out already defeated and run away without so much as scratching you.

* LEVEL TWO ; To get extra health, shoot the fat guy using a girl as a shield. He moves forward to shoot at you - shoot him then.

Target practice: Getting all of the targets (100% hit) gives *extra* capacity for your energy bar.

Bug: Missing one target sometimes still gives 100% (but don't rely on it.).

* LEVEL THREE: Go over the top of the car crushers, and pick up the baby food. Try and save the Cobra assault cannon for the end of the level - this makes thing much easier. If you shoot just under the cab of the final enemy, you can kill the guy throwing grenades at you.

Alternate way: Get the cobra cannon, clean all the enemies at the elevator, the raise the elevator until the cobra cannon is slightly higher than ground level (about 1/4 inch or less), fire ONCE to the right and watch your score soar. Don't move or your score will stop. Also, this only works on the bootleg board - the original did not do this, probably due to a bug (At the far right, just outside of the screen, are some boxes and the machine thinks you hit them but doesn't destroy them).

* LEVEL FOUR: Shoot the metal crushers with the Cobra Cannon, or PUNCH repeatedly if you get trapped. The final enemy is a crane which swings a steel ball suspended from an extensible chain. Don't shoot the wooden box, stand on it and shoot the cab of the crane. Also, try to save the Cobra Cannon (by punching bad guys instead of shooting them) and use it on the crane.

* LEVEL FIVE: Don't charge through this level, especially on the conveyor belt. Be wary of the first guy armed with a flame thrower; if you're quick enough, you can shoot him before he gets a chance to shoot at you.

The military ED209 at the end of the level can be beaten by crouching under the OCP logo when it charges. Jump and shoot the weapon arm when it retreats.

* LEVEL SIX: You need to move through this level fairly quickly as time is a little tight. The ground-based moving gun turrets can be shot from the platform below, and careful diagonal shooting can destroy laser emplacements situated on any platforms above you. Concentrate on laser turrets which are diagonally away from you, as their fire is the hardest to dodge.

The last baby food on the level replenishes all of RoboCop's energy. Try and keep the laser shots until the end of the level. When you reach the top platform, move as far to the right as possible and shoot the military ED209 as much as possible before it activates. There is a comparatively safe position just at the end of the military ED209's forward walk (like the end of level five, but with no OCP marker). Kill the military ED209 first. Tactics for the other ED209 are similar to those of level 1.

* LEVEL SEVEN: Use diagonal shooting to destroy laser turrets on the platform above you (see also Level Six comment).

The baby food stored in the box gives all your energy back. When you reach the single lift which goes up multiple floors, the best way to avoid being trapped on it by laser fire is to JUMP onto the next level just before the lift reaches it. Timing between the laser shots is critical.

When this lift reaches the top, stop just short of the floor (you should be able to see/hear the light curtains and laser turrets) and then go back down as far as you can. The laser turrets and curtains sometimes disappear.

The final ED209 can be destroyed by standing at the far left of the screen and jumping up and down. Missiles launched at you can be destroyed by shooting or punching. When the ED209 gets too close, use the tactic of level one.

When ED209 is destroyed, kill Dick Jones (in the same way as a gunman holding a hostage is killed). The president is not harmed by your gun shots and must be punched from close range.

Rage of the Dragons (c) 2002 Playmore Corp.

Rage of the Dragons is an original fighting game with 14 selectable fighters plus Abubo (sub-boss, hidden character) and Johann (final boss).

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-264

Buttons: 4
=&gt; [A] Weak Punch, [B] Weak Kick, [C] Strong Punch, [D] Strong Kick

- TRIVIA -

Released in June 2002, Rage of the Dragons is the first fighting game developed by Evoga Entertainment. This game is a collaboration between Evoga (Mexico), Brezza Soft (Japan) and Noise Factory (Japan).

Evoga tried to make a new "Double Dragon" game and attempted to acquire the rights to "Double Dragon" from Technos Japan but they refused to sell. Without the proper rights to use the Double Dragon property, Evoga decided to do a game that pays homage to the Double Dragon series instead. For example, William 'Billy' Lewis, James 'Jimmy' Lewis and 'Abubo' are analogous to the characters Billy Lee, Jimmy Lee and Abobo from "Double Dragon". One funny thing about these Evoga characters is that they appear in Noise Factory's "Matrimeele", which is based on the Power Instinct series by Atlus.

Pupa Salgueiro &amp; Cassandra Murata are the only characters in the game that have two super moves instead of just one. These being the Ultimate Quexada (for Pupa) and a ground version of the White Wave (for Cassandra).

Linda, the famous lady with the whip in the Double Dragon games makes an appearance as one of Abubo's girlfriends in his intro pose as well as in the second Abubo cutscene.

Alice Carroll's name seems curiously inspired in the famous children's book "Alice in Wonderland" and by the name of its author Lewis Carroll. Odd...

Jones features many funny references to Bruce Lee such as his outfit (Bruce Lee's famous outfit in the 'Game of Death' movie), a few of his moves &amp; poses, and a suspicious quote in his ending!:)

The stage of Radel and Annie is a night club called 'Noise Factory' just as one of the 3 companies which worked on the game.

On the parking lot stage, there is a TV screen displaying credits for a movie. It contains Engrish text 'Special Sanks' instead of 'Special Thanks'.

Noise Factory released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Rage of the Dragons Original Arrange Album) on 13/09/2002.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Abubo: at the character select screen, press quickly Up(x4), Down(x3), Left(x2), Right. A little melody indicates that the cheat worked and Abubo should appear on center.

* The game encourages the use of team up attacks. In fact, by finishing each opponent with a team up attack will get you some nice grades &amp; a respectable score! (perfect lifebars with this tip will get you a handsome SSS grade every time!!!):)

* Jones' air version of his First Impact combo is broken against Alice since the last hit will always miss! Beware!:/

* Johann, the last boss in the game cannot be dizzied since he lacks a dizzy animation, this can be seen by performing a team up attack on him. This makes this already cheap boss even harder to defeat!:/

* After each battle, a rank is determined based on your fighting level. Here are the different levels and the bonus points awarded to the player if he reaches them:
SSS: 100,000 points
SS: 75,000 points
S: 50,000 points
A: 25,000 points
B: 10,000 points
C: 7,500 points
D: 5,000 points
E: 0 point

Rygar - Legendary Warrior (c) 1986 Tecmo.

Export release. Game developed in Japan. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese release entry; "Argos no Senshi - Legendary Warrior".

- TRIVIA -

Rygar was released in May 1986.

The differences between the US and Japanese (Argus no Senshi) are:
* The demo sequences are different.
* The Japanese version seems to have more hidden powers, stars and an extra free life.
* The US version is more biased towards stars and explosions.

- UPDATES -

The differences between the US (set 1) and US (set 2) are:
* 'Set 2' has a bug in the code which lets p2 start a game when p1 is already playing. You need to set a dip-switch to enable this behavior (it is usually on by default). If you press '2' while p1 is playing a single player game, 'Set 2' will check that you have 1 or more credit before it registers that you're now in a 2 player game, but it won't deduct the credit. That's a bad bug and probably accounts for why a bug-fix version was released.
* In 'Set 2', if p2 starts while p1 is already playing, it says 'playre2' instead of 'player2' at the top right.
* The first screen of 'Set 2' says 'ALL RIGHT RESERVED' - missing an 'S' - that's fixed in 'Set 1'

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 23 years ago:

Strikers 1945 Plus (c) 1999 Psikyo.

After inserting quarters and hitting the Start button, the player chooses one of 6 planes (plus 1 hidden plane) or can opt for a random choice.

The available fighters are:
* P-38 Lightning
* Vought XF5U 'Flying Pancake'
* Spitfire Mk. VI
* Zero Type 52
* Focke Wulf Ta 152
* Fiat G.56
* XP-55 Ascender (Hidden) 

The first 4 stages are in random order, while the last 4 are sequential. Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique 'supershot' which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a Bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds.

After the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level. All level are similar to the ones in Strikers 1945 II. Only one of the 4 bosses that are randomly chosen and the 6th boss is changed.

Items are sometimes dropped by enemies that can range from items that restore health, give extra points, or crystals that allow the Senshi to perform special attacks. Up to five crystals can be collected per player to power up the Senshi's special attacks. During the most difficult moments in battle, Tuxedo Mask will appear and throw a rose, which is a bonus to pick up and depart.</desc>

An 'upgrade' of the Samurai Spirits Zero episode with its 24 fighters plus 4 more characters: Amakusa, Gaoh, Zankuro and Mizuki. It's probably the ultimate game released on MVS since SNK Playmore decided to develop its future games on AtomisWave.

- TRIVIA -

Samurai Spirits Zero Special was released in April 2004 in Japan.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown V Special'.

The original version of the game contain some bugs and characters don't have fatalities. To correct that, SNK Playmore released corrected cartridges (without any problems) which can be recognized by a small NeoGeo sticker on the top right

On the game box, SNK put the following message: 'A final Farewell. To all of our customers, who have purchased NeoGeo rom cartridges up till now, thank you very much. We offer our most heartfelt gratitude for your loyal patronage over these 14 full years and hope for your continued support for our games on the many other platforms we will provide products for in the future. NeoGeo fans rule!'.

Some rumors says that SNK Playmore wanted to release an other upgrade of "Samurai Shodown V" on NeoGeo MVS called "Samurai Shodown V Special Final" including 2 new characters, some new stages and the correction of all the original game's bugs. A location test occurred in Tokyo in october 2004 but then SNK Playmore denied developing this game.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* I'm Not Afraid Of You!: think you are really good? Tap Start 3 times quickly to make your character drop his/her sword. Now show your opponents that the most fearsome weapons are the ones you were born with!

* The game has several last bosses: Amakusa,  Zankuro, Gao and Muzuki. In order to reach the latter bosses, you need to perform a fatality on the former ones. If you don't, you'll instead get a bad ending.

Samurai Spirits Zero (c) 2003 SNK Playmore.

A 5th episode of the Samurai Shodown saga on Neo-Geo with 24 selectable characters plus Poppy (secret character) plus 3 bosses (Sankuro the mid-boss, Yumeji the sub-boss and the general Gaoh as final boss).

- TRIVIA -

Samurai Spirits Zero was released in October 2003 in Japan. Called ZERO because its story takes place before the first Samurai Spirits episode.

This game is known outside Japan as Samurai Shodown V.

Parts of Shiki's personality are homages to Rei Ayanami (a character from Evangelion) and Mugen no Jyuunin. As a matter of fact, one of her winquotes was taken word-for-word from a quote in Evangelion.

Rera first appeared in a Nakoruru OVA titled 'Nakoruru - Ano hito kara no okurimono'.

Sankuro's name and moves (which call out his henchmen), collectively, contain all the digits from one to nine.

Yumeji's attacks are all borrowed from other characters (for most of them, she morphs into the character she is borrowing the move from). Her Shin Musou Ittou-ryuu Kagerou and Shin Musou Ittou-ryuu Sasame Yuki - Sen are all borrowed from Ukyo's Bust moves in SS4 (Ukyo only has his Slash moves from SS4 in SS5). She also borrows: Charlotte's Bayonette Lunge, Genjuro's Sanren Satsu, Hanzo's Ninpou Mozu Otoshi, Haohmaru's Ougi - Kogetsu Zan, Jubei's Yagyu Shingan Tou - Souha, Kyoshiro's Choubi Jishi, Nakoruru's Annu Mutsube, Rimururu's Rupush Kamui Weison Pekoru, Ukyo's Hiken Tsubame Gaeshi, Yoshitora's Yon no Tachi - Tsubaki.

The creator of the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin', Nobuhiro Watsuki, helped to make 'Yoshitora Tokugawa'. Nobuhiro Watsuki has declared many times his love for the Samurai Spirits video-games. You can find some characters in his work strictly copied from these series.

Card game: In December 2006, Sabertooth Games released a Samurai Shodown V collectable card game set for it's Universal Fighting System (UFS) game.

- UPDATES -

If you put the game in 'Japan territory' via the MVS bios setting, the story mode will be completed by little scenes of dialogs between the different characters.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Costume Color Select: everyone has four outfit colors chosen by A, B, C or D. The (D) button ones seem to be the oddest ones.

* Play as Poppy: on the character select screen highlight 'Kazuki' and then move Left, Right, Left(x2), Right(x2), Left(x2), Right and then button A to select (use buttons B to D instead for different colors).

* I'm Not Afraid Of You!: think you are really good? Tap Start 3 times quickly to make your character drop his/her sword. Now show your opponents that the most fearsome weapons are the ones you were born with!

* Secret Win Pose: if you get a Perfect win in the second round with Galford, one of Poppy's puppies will show up and run forward, only to stumble and land on it's stomach.

* Pursuit Reset: pick Jubei and perform a Big Pursuit when unarmed (press Up+B+C when your opponent is down). The game will reset.

This is probably the most manic of the "Head-on" type of games, as instead of a car (or 2) you're trying to avoid a head-on collision with, you have a missile trying to ram into you. This gives added pressure, since you must be able to outrace the missile at the end of the round.

Maybe also known as "Missile Chaser".

- SCORING -

Dots: 10 points X level number. 
Levels start at 1 and go up to 9. After that level 9 keeps repeating itself.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* How to finish off the first screen:
1) Let your rocket finish off the half of the bottom row you are on, but turn around before you turn the corner. Turn towards the center when you get back to where you were.
2) Finish off the ten sets of two dots in the middle. Watch out for the missile trying to strike you. Although you should have no problem with giving your rocket a moment's needed boost, try to do as much as possible without boosting through the center. You'll need it later.
3) Take the circle of dots that surrounds the inner area. 
4) Go to the bottom row. You should have the left half of the bottom line ready. Go around, finishing the dots.
5) On the last row, hit the boost. You'll need it to finish.

* Hold down 2P DOWN while it says INSERT COIN. Then insert a coin and play. You will have 2 extra ships.

* In the Hard difficulty setting, you normally start at level 4. Hold down the 1P START (the 1 key) while it says INSERT COIN. Then insert a coin and play. You will start at level 5.

		<name>Super Dodge Ball / Kunio no Nekketsu Toukyuu Densetsu</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 26 years ago:

くにおの熱血闘球伝説 (c) 1996 Technos Japan Corp.
(Kunio no Nekketsu Toukyuu Densetsu)

The popular game of Dodge Ball is a rather unique sport in which teams of three players try to knock each other out with the help of special moves and team attacks. In this game you take control of a team and must beat all other teams (you can even recruit the other team's leader after beating them!) in order to face the  current Dodge Ball champion and take the title. Features cool anime style graphics, catchy music &amp; great sound effects, plenty of moves at your disposal and a solid challenge level. Dodge Ball anyone?:)

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-208

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 4
=&gt; [A] Shoot/Catch, [B] Pass/Dodge, [C] Jump, [D] Faint/Provoke

- TRIVIA -

Literaly 'Kunio's Hotblooded Dodgeball Legend'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Super Dodge Ball'.

This game runs on the Neo-Geo MVS but was never released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.

This is yet another game by Technos that features characters inspired by the River City Ransom manga. In the overhead map at the beginning of each match, all characters are drawn in a comical small body style, apparently as an homage of the famous NES games that featured the River City Ransom characters.

Kunio appears in "Renegade" / "Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun" as main characters.

After the release of this game, Technos Japan went bankrupt (December 15, 95). Since the licenses of Kunio-Kun and Dodge-Ball had a great values in the 90's, former Technos Japan staff established a new company.

- UPDATES -

The International versions of this game are almost identical to the Japanese version (no voice cuts as in the Magical Drop games), only the title screen is completely different &amp; the fact that Shinji's taunt is censored outside Japan (Instead of merely shaking his fist angrily at his opponents, Shinji gives them the middle finger!).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Characters turn VERY slowly in this game, this means that you can score free hits if you either run past them and smack them with the ball, or pass the ball to a teammate that has already been defeated!

* Beat the game without continuing to see a special screen after the credits with all the characters grouped together.

		<name>Street Fighter II': Champion Edition</name>
		<desc>Two characters fight each other in martial arts matches held on several continents. The winner of two out of three rounds moves on to the next stage. The game also allows the Boss characters to be chosen for play.

Street Fighter II': Champion Edition  is a competitive fighting game released for the arcades by Capcom in 1992. It was the first of several updated versions of the original Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. The main changes consisted of the addition of the Grand Masters (the final four computer-controlled opponents in the single-player mode) as playable characters and mirror matches (same character vs. matches). The fighting techniques of the eight main characters from the original game were also further refined to allowed for more balanced competitive play.

Champion Edition was followed by Street Fighter II' Turbo: Hyper Fighting, released several months later.</desc>

960813

960826

ADDITIONAL NOTES: 

In the Green Board [Japan] release: 
* Charlie is called 'Nash' 
* M. Bison is called 'Vega' 
* Akuma is called 'Gouki' 
* Evil Ryu is called 'Satsui No Hadou Ni Mezameta Ryu' (translated as "Ryu in which the surge of the intent to kill has awakened")

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Two vs. One Battle: Hold LK+MK+HK and press Start at the start screen. 

* Fight Your Mid Boss: Win five rounds with a Super finish or Custom Combo finish, and don't lose a round before the sixth match.

* Fight Shin Akuma: Hold MK+MP and press Start at the start screen. 

* Survival Battle: Hold LP+MP+HP and press Start at the start screen. 

* SFII' Versions Of Ryu, Ken, Sagat, M. Bison, Dhalsim, Zangief: Highlight the character and press Start. 

* Evil Ryu: Highlight Ryu and press Start twice. 

* SFII Costume Chun Li, SFII' Chun Li: Highlight Chun Li and press Start once for SFII costume Chun Li, twice for SFII' Chun Li. 

* Choose A Win Pose: Hold Start + any attack button after winning a round to determine your win pose.

* Alternate Colors For Sakura: Highlight Sakura and press Start(x5). 

* Stage Select: Can only be done when a second player enters the game, therefore the message "Here Comes A New Challenger!!" must appear before returning to the select screen. On the select screen, highlight a character icon and hold Start for 2 seconds. Then choose your fighter. If you want the grassy Australia stage (the tall grass), hold Start on Sagat's icon for 2 seconds then select your character (do not let go of Start). To select the Venezuela stage (the waterfall), do the same steps you would do to select Australia, except hold Start on Charlie's icon instead of Sagat's.

		<name>Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams</name>
		<desc>This game continues the fighting game tradition and provides few alternative characters from Capcom's past games. It's Street Fighter as you always remember it, with some new moves, characters and combo systems, as well as a more polished look and feel.

The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.

The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</desc>

		<desc>Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix was produced by Capcom in 1997.

A 1-on-1 versus fighting game in the Street Fighter mold with a cast of "super deformed" fighters taken from several of Capcom's fighting game series. Ryu, Ken, Chun Li, Zangief and Akuma are featured from Street Fighter II, Sakura and Dan from Street Fighter Alpha. Ibuki is from Street Fighter III. Hsein-Ko, Morrigan and Felicia are featured from DarkStalkers. It also includes the character Tessa from Warzard.

It's the most outrageous fighting game ever! Innocent but deadly, these pint-sized champions from Street Fighter and DarkStalkers pack one heck of a punch. Battle to collect power-up gems and duke it out with the most insane attacks and hilarious fighting combos of all time.</desc>

		<name>Shock Troopers</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 25 years ago:

Shock Troopers (c) 1997 SNK.

Shock Troopers pits the players against a mighty terrorist group who are holding a girl hostage, in order to force her grandfather to surrender a powerful drug which will enable the terrorists to control the minds of the grandfather's soldiers and create a huge, unstoppable army.

Shock Troopers is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players that builds upon the foundations laid by Capcom's 1985 classic, "Commando (Capcom)" and also borrows heavily from Commando's sequel, '"Mercs". As well as enemy troops, players must contend with tanks, choppers and assorted military vehicles, and must also be careful to avoid any of the landmines that litter the levels. Extra weapons and health can be picked up from destroyed enemy vehicles, as well as being found in enemy supply crates. Shock Troopers is effectively three games in one as players can chose one of three different routes; each made up of different levels. The game also offers greater variety of gameplay than other of the genre; with levels having the players travel on the back of fast moving vehicles, climbing a rock face etc.

		<name>Side Pocket</name>
		<desc>The primary play mode, called "Pocket Game", is a straight pool game set within a limited number of lives; the player must achieve a predetermined score to advance through four or five levels, each with increasing number of balls. The player earns points by potting balls, potting balls on consecutive shots, and potting balls in numerical order. On occasion, a flashing star appear in a pocket, and if the player pots a ball into that pocket in the same shot, a bonus will be awarded in the form of points, extra lives or a bonus round. One life is lost if the player scratches or fails to pot a ball in two consecutive shots.

In the two-player mode, the player can choose between Pocket Game or 9-Ball Game. In two-player Pocket Game, the game plays similarly, except the two players take turns and there are no lives; if one player misses or scratches, control of the ball simply changes to the other player. In 9-Ball Game, each player have three lives and one life is lost if a foul is committed. However, the lives will be restored if the player pots a ball on the next turn.</desc>

		<desc>Professional wrestling experienced a sudden increase in popularity during the early 1980s, where many professional wrestling organizations were started all over the world. A severe rivalry existed among the organizations.

In order to resolve this conflict, 8 organizations combined to form the Capcom Professional Wrestling Association (CPWA), led by Victor Ortega, the CPWA’s first champion.

One day, Ortega suddenly vanished. He was considered to be the axis of the sport and his unexpected disappearance caused the CPWA to enter an age of confusion and disorder. The BPWA, a dark underground wrestling organization, chose to take advantage of this opportunity and began moving. With "Fighters of Muscle Bomber = Destiny" as the theme, the CPWA chief executives decided to hold a world tour called the “Crash Carnival,” to decide the new king of the CPWA.

Burst right into the feverish puzzle action that combines irresistible, addictive fun with famous Capcom characters. Beat your opponent to the punch by stacking block after block in strategic patterns and color combinations. Be the first to fill the opponent's screen with blocks and K.O. you win! But get ready for more, because you can't play just once.</desc>

Miracle Adventure (c) 1993 Data East Corp.

Johnny &amp; Tom, two treasure seekers must save their friend Mary from the evil Mad Doctor and his army of goofy-dressed henchmen, as well as gather the map pieces in order to find the biggest treasure in the world at the same time! Features hilarious cartoon-like character designs and sound effects, awesome looking giant bosses (check out the Chinese dragon!) &amp; fast-paced platforming action!

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-062

Players: 2
Control: 8-Way Joystick
Buttons: 3
=&gt; [A] Shoot/Power Attack, [B] Jump, [C] Super Attack

- TRIVIA -

Miracle Adventure was released on December 16, 1993 in Japan.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Spinmaster'.

Miracle Adventure is Data East's first game developed and released for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.

This game seems heavily inspired by Data East's classic game "Caveman Ninja" (the artwork style, some character's animations, as well as the weapon's power up styles are a little too similar!).

The Mad Doctor also appeared as the final boss in Data East's "Tumble Pop".

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Miracle Adventure. Tatakae Genshijin 3 - PCCB-00146) on February 18, 1994.

		<name>Vs. Super Mario Bros.</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 36 years ago:

Vs. Super Mario Bros. (c) 1986 Nintendo.

Classic and cult horizontal platform game featuring the Nintendo mascot Mario who must save princess Toadstool (Princess Peach in Japan) from Bowser (Koopa in Japan).

- TECHNICAL -

Vs. Super Mario Bros. is most common in a converted "Donkey Kong" or "Donkey Kong Junior" cabinet (this game was only available as a kit, there were no dedicated cabinets made). Actually, any copy of this game that is not in a converted Donkey Kong series cabinet is incorrect (as the Vs. kit was only designed for those cabinets). Nintendo designed a special small joystick for their Vs. Unisystem games (allowing a 2 player setup on the tiny Donkey Kong control panel). Another difference between this title and most standard games was audio that was processed in the monitor (although this was the same as most other early Nintendo titles). One other notable thing about this title is that either joystick will control either player (most Vs. titles were like this), making it rather pointless to have 2 sticks in the first place.

- TRIVIA -

Vs. Super Mario Bros. was released in February 1986 in the USA.

Basically, this is the arcade port of the Nintendo Famicom "Super Mario Bros.". There are slight differences:
* Item placement in the '?' and hidden blocks differs slightly, so if you're used to the Playchoice-10 version you may find a few different and unexpected items in certain familiar places.
* Parts of levels were also changed slightly, too, the most noticeable being a gap in the ceiling bricks on the way to the Warp Zone in World 1-2.
* This seems to make the World -1 trick impossible to do on Vs. Super Mario Bros., as it involved the use of these removed bricks.
* More enemies added in most levels
* Bug fixes / preventions.

This game is also known as "Vs. Mario's Adventure".

A hack of this game where made by Two-Bits Score and is known as "Skate Kid Bros.".

Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on Apr. 24th, 2009.

A Vs. Super Mario Bros. unit appears in the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men'; Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Increase The Number Of Marios By 100 Or More: There is a way of increasing the number of Marios by more than 100. At the end of World 3-1, when Koopa Troopa comes on the block stairway just before the flagpole... and reaches the lowest step, jump on him to make him stop moving.

* The 999 Timer Bonus Trick: This one can be done on any of the -4 Worlds. It is most difficult to achieve on World 6-4 and World 7-4. What you do is try to end the level with the timer at 000, and the machine will act as though you have 1000 units of time instead of 0. It will drop to 999 and count down to 000 from there and award points for each unit of time. Simply jump to the axe as the timer goes from 002 to 001 and you should finish the screen with the timer at 000 and get the maximum bonus.

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 19 years ago:

SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom (c) 2003 Playmore Corp.

A one-on-one fighting game - the collaboration between Capcom and SNK - pits seventeen well-known SNK combatants against seventeen of Capcom's most famous game characters.

'SVC Chaos' primarily utilizes the command system of the "King of Fighters" series, incorporating light/strong kicks, punches, cancels and charging attacks. Unlike its predecessor, however, "Capcom vs. SNK 2", SvC features no air guards and lacks a 'groove system', instead focusing on quicker game play and online competition.

Each character is equipped with a basic three-bar system for executing 'Exceeds' (special attacks), with basic filling options attributed to strikes and damage. Additionally, the sprites from the various series received new models and some special effects were changed in the command lists (For example, the player can no longer increase the damage of the 'Zujou Sashi' used by Choi Bounge by tapping the buttons).

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.

Here are the 17 SNK characters (plus Evil Mr Karate) and their first appearance in video games:
Athena Asamiya - "Athena"

Kyo Kusanagi - "The King of Fighters '94"
Geese Howard - "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" ("Garou Densetsu - Shukumei no Tatakai" in Japan)
Genjyuro Kibagami - "Samurai Shodown II" ("Samurai Spirits II" in Japan)
Goenitz - "The King of Fighters '96"
Mai Shiranui - "Fatal Fury 2" ("Garou Densetsu 2 - Arata-Naru Tatakai" in Japan)

Shiki - "Samurai Shodown 64" ("Samurai Spirits 64" in Japan)

There are also 17 Capcom characters (plus Shin Akuma) and here are their first appearances:
Akuma (Gouki in Japan) - "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" ("Super Street Fighter II X" in Japan)
Balrog (M. Bison in Japan) - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Chun-Li - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Dan Hibiki - "Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams" ("Street Fighter Zero" in Japan)
Demitri -  "Darkstalkers - The Night Warriors" ("Vampire - The Night Warriors" in Japan)
Dhalsim - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Guile - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Hugo - "Final Fight"
Ken Masters - "Street Fighter"
M. Bison (Vega in Japan) - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Red Arremer - "Ghosts'n Goblins"
Ryu - "Street Fighter"
Sagat - "Street Fighter"
Tessa - "Red Earth" ("Warzard" in Japan)
Vega (Balrog in Japan) - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Violent Ken - "Street Fighter Alpha 3" ("Street Fighter Zero 3" in Japan)
Zero - "Mega Man X" ("Rockman X" in Japan)

The super bar is called the 'Groove Power Gauge'; a reference to "Capcom Vs. SNK 2 - Mark of the Millenium 2001".

Bao (from the King of Fighters series) makes a cameo in a few of Hugo's pre-battle and win poses.

The Athena that features in SVC Chaos is the original Athena character design that featured in the character's debut platform game, "Athena", instead of the usual Asimaya Athena that appears in virtually every other SNK game. Notably, a lot of her moves are now very different, and she wears noticeably less clothes due to the fact Athena loses her dress during Athena's intro. Athena's fighting moves are inspired by the manga/anime 'Saint Seiya'.

The 'Sennou Ken' character is based on the psycho-controlled Ken in the SF animated movie. A lot of Mars People's moves are references to numerous UFO-based staples; Independence is a reference to the movie 'Independence Day', for example.

The 'Dan Hibiki' character is once again used as a vehicle for numerous genre parodies. If you perform his super-taunt he parodies Joe Higashi and Yuri Sakazaki's taunts. Also, two of his new moves are parodies of the Kyokugen moves. In the first of these moves, Dan attempts to do one of the larger fireballs performed in one Ryo's desperation move, but it has the same range as his regular fireball. On the second move, Dan attempts to perform his own powerful punch similar to Ryo's Exceed move, but after the move charges and connects Dan grabs his arm in pain and then pretends it was nothing.

While using Demitri, if you perform Midnight Bliss on Orochi Iori, Iori will turn into Miss X (from SNK Gal Fighters on the Neo Geo Pocket) as he's choking him.

Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game on November 2003.

Some well-known hacks of the game include:
"SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom Plus".
"SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom Super Plus".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Random Select: On the character select screen, hold Start to activate a roulette-like feature.

* Play as Geese: Hold Start and press Left(x3), Down, Left, Up, Right, Up, then press a button to select.

* Play as Dan: Hold Start and press Down, Left(x7), then press a button to select.

* Play as Goenitz: Hold Start and press Down(x3), Right, Down, Left(x3), then press a button to select.

* Play as Demitri: Hold Start and press Right(x3), Left, Up, Right, Down, Up, then press a button to select.

* Play as Mars People: Hold Start and press Up, Down, Right(x3), Up, Down, Left(x2), Down, then press a button to select.

* Play as Zero: Hold Start and press Up, Right(x2), Left(x2), Down, Up(x3), Right, then press a button to select.

* Play as Orochi Iori: Hold Start and press Up(x3), Down, Left, Right, Down, Left, then press a button to select.

* Play as Violent Ken: Hold Start and press Up(x2), Down, Left(x2), Right, Left, Up, then press a button to select.

* Fight against Red Arremer:
1) Finish 5 rounds with supers/specials.
2) Do not lose any rounds.
3) Finish off at least one character with block damage.
If done correctly, your character will be transported to Hell after the fight with Shin Akuma/Shin Mr. Karate, where he/she will have to fight Red Arremer. Note: Some people (like Dan and Demitri) have alternate endings for fighting and winning in Hell.

* Fight either Mars People or Zero: Don't lose any rounds, Don't win any rounds by "Time Out", win 3 rounds by using an Exceed Move.

* Fight Geese Howard or Demitri Maximoff: Don't lose any rounds, Don't win any rounds by "Time Out", win 1 round by using an Exceed Move.

*Fight Goenitz or Dan Hibiki: Fail to meet either of the above requirements.

Also your opponent on Stage 6 determines who you will fight in Stages 7 and 8.

* Fight Orochi Iori (Stage 7) and Serious Mr. Karate (Stage 8): Stage 6 opponent is a Capcom character.

* Fight Violent Ken (Stage 7) and Shin Akuma (Stage 8): Stage 6 opponent is an SNK character.

* Fight Athena: Don't lose any rounds during Stages 1 through 7, Don't win any rounds by block damage.

* Mid-Bosses: your performance in Stages 1 through 3 affects who you will fight in Stage 4.

* Final Bosses: your performance in Stages 1 through 7 affects if you'll fight either Athena or Red Arremer (in Stage 9) after beating Stage 8 (Shin Akuma or Serious Mr. Karate). Your performance in Stage 8 will not affect any of these conditions.

* See character's true/good ending: Defeat Athena or Red Arremer in Stage 9. If you lose to Athena or Red Arremer then you cannot continue. Many characters (such as Dan and Demitri) have different endings for beating either Athena or Red Arremer.

* CPU Character Patterns: before you start the game the CPU randomly picks one of the predetermined patterns of opponents. This affects stages 1 through 3 and 5 &amp; 6. Stage 4 is the predetermined mid-boss. Here are the predetermined pattern of fighters.
Pattern 1: Kim, Dhalsim, Mai, Bison, Kyo
Pattern 2: Vega, Earthquake, Chun-Li, Choi, Ryo
Pattern 3: Shiki, Balrog, Kasumi, Sagat, Iori
Pattern 4: Guile, Genjyuro, Tessa, Kim, Ken
Pattern 5: Tessa, Sagat, Mr. Karate, Chun-Li, Ryo
Pattern 6: Chun-Li, Kasumi, Hugo, Mr. Karate, Guile
Pattern 7: Mr. Karate, Hugo, Shiki, Dhalsim, Terry
Pattern 8: Choi, Mai, Vega, Genjyuro, Akuma
Pattern 9: Kasumi, Chun-Li, Shiki, Tessa, Mai
Pattern 10: Earthquake, Vega, Akuma, Ken, Ryu
Pattern 11: Dhalsim, Hugo, Kyo, Balrog, Iori
Pattern 12: Iori, Guile, Bison, Kim, Ken
Pattern 13: Ryu, Balrog, Kim, Sagat, Ryo
Pattern 14: Terry, Choi, Earthquake, Genjyuro, Guile
Pattern 15: Kyo, Ken, Ryo, Ryu, Terry
Pattern 16: Balrog, Vega, Sagat, Bison, Akuma

So let's say the CPU randomly chooses Pattern 16 (which interesting enough follows the boss pattern of Street Fighter II plus Akuma), you would fight Balrog, Vega, and Sagat in stages 1 through 3, fight the mid-boss in stage 4, fight Bison and Akuma in stages 5 through 6, and then fight Orochi Iori and Serious Mr. Karate in stages 7 through 8 (since the stage 6 opponent was a Capcom character).

		<desc>Sunday evening. You're sitting around the sewer watching your main reporter, April O'Neil do a live remote from the Statue of Liberty, then it happens. A humungoso flying android screams out of the sky and rips Lady Liberty from her foundation, sending hundreds of freaked out tourists into the harbor below. "No way!" cries Raphael. "Way", replies Donatello, and the crazy quantum chase is on! Journey through multiple levels of enormous graphics, the largest and craziest talking Turtles ever with eons of bodacious battlegrounds, from prehistoric to futuristic galaxies. Get ready for the 3-D jab and toss that sends enemies flying right in your face. Mondo body slams and pizza power bonuses make you more Turtle than ever before. You better believe you're going to need it. Shredder's out for Turtle hide. And he's got all the time in the world to get it.</desc>

		<desc>Treasure of the Caribbean is a puzzle game: you must combine three ghosts or more of the same color. The number of combined ghosts above three are sent to the opponent in the form of graves. Of course, these can in turn be returned if they are close to a combination of three colored ghosts. Of course, the speed also increases but not enough to make the game impossible as a Puyo Puyo or Tetris for example.</desc>

Thrash Rally (c) 1991 Alpha Denshi.

Thrash Rally is a top-down perspective rally racing game for one or two players. Each race begins with players asked to choose a vehicle in which to race, with each offering a different balance between handling, acceleration, vehicle endurance and top speed. 

There are two racing modes on offer. The first, World Rally Championship, features rounds that take place over lap-based circuits, with each lap having to be completed within a set time limit. World Rally mode offers players a choice of six different rally cars.

The second mode is the Paris-to-Dakar rally. This doesn’t feature laps but is a point-to-point race, with each stage having to be completed within a set time limit. In addition to the six rally cars of the World Rally mode, the Paris-to-Dakar Rally also allows players to race in either a buggy, a motorbike, or a truck.

All tracks feature a variety of different road surfaces, such as snow, gravel, sand or water. Many of the tracks also feature a variety of jumps and chicanes, as well as track-based obstacles that should be avoided.

* Technician (United Kingdom) Driving 2 - Accuracy 4 - Skill 5 - Recovery 4 - Putting 3
* Veteran (Australia) Driving 1 - Accuracy 2 - Skill 4 - Recovery 5 - Putting 2
* Shot Maker (Germany) Driving 4 - Accuracy 5 - Skill 2 - Recovery 2 - Putting 4
* Power Golfer (Brazil) Driving 5 - Accuracy 1 - Skill 1 - Recovery 1 - Putting 1
* Putt Master (Japan) Driving 3 - Accuracy 2 - Skill 4 - Recovery 2 - Putting 5

Players can choose to play on one of four eighteen-hole courses: Germany, Japan, Australia and U.S.A. Two game modes are available: one-player stroke play against the CPU, or stroke or match-play against a second player.

Unlike many golf games of the era that used a two-click swing system to determine the hook or slice of the ball, "Neo Turf Masters" uses a single click for the power of the shot and a second for the height of the shot. Hook and slice are determined before making the shot. 

Big Tournament Golf follows the standard golf scoring system. The order from the best to the worst performance is:
Albatros (3 hits under Par)
Eagle (2 hits under Par)
Birdie (1 hit under Par)
Par (reach the par for the hole)
Bogey (1 hit over Par)
Double Bogey (2 hits over Par)
Triple Bogey (3 hits over Par)

If players miss the attempt to make a Triple Bogey, they will have to give up the hole and will suffer an additional penalty. If the ball lands out of bounds or in the water, the player will be penalized one stroke.

* Contests are sometimes announced at the start of a hole:

1) The closest to the pin contest: players must hit the ball as close as possible to the pin when driving off. If their ball gets closer to the pin than the previous record, they will earn a bonus hole.

2) The longest driving contest: players must drive the ball as far as possible. If they exceed the previous record, they will earn a bonus hole.

- TRIVIA -

Big Tournament Golf was released in January 1996 in Japan.

This game is known outside Japan as Neo Turf Masters.

This is the first Nazca game written for the Neo-Geo MVS. Nazca was formed over Irem's death by Irem ex-members with the financal help of SNK. Nasca was originally financed by SNK to adapt their arcade games for home consoles like Playstation and Saturn.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Random Selection: Press A+B+C+D at the player selection and/or the course selection screen.

* Sometimes contests appear during a hole:

1) The closest to the pin contest: you have to hit the ball as close as possible to the hole in one hit. If the ball gets closer to the pin than the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.

2) The longest driving contest: you have to drive the ball as far as possible. If you exceed the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.

		<name>Varth: Operation Thunderstorm</name>
		<desc>Varth: Operation Thunderstorm was produced by Capcom in 1992.

Capcom released 209 different machines in our database under this trade name, starting in 1984.

Other machines made by Capcom during the time period Varth: Operation Thunderstorm was produced include Adventure Quiz Capcom World 2, Street Fighter II' Turbo - Hyper Fighting, Street Fighter II - Hyper Fighting, Sangokushi II, Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition, Quiz Sangokushi - Chiryaku No Hasha, Street Fighter II - The World Warrior, Block Block, Capcom Golf, and Quiz Tonosama No Yabou.

A vertically scrolling shooter with planes and other ships to destroy. The game progresses through several levels, many of which are based in standard cities. Earn lives and power-ups by shooting down enemies.Varth follows the story of a disaster that befalls a human colony on a planet of the same name. The entire colony is run by a 7th generation supercomputer which controls the operations of all machinery on the planet. Unfortunately for the residents of Varth, Delta-7 has been possessed by the entity "DUO" (Dimension Unbody Offender), thought of as an evil spirit but actually a temporal-spatial consciousness which spontaneously arose within the supercomputer. DUO has come to the conclusion that human existence is inimical to the planet, and has therefore turned the planet's defenses against its own populace. Eighty percent of the planet is laid waste by the event, and this is only the beginning of DUO's cleansing scheme. The colonists' reliance on the supercomputer has caused them to lose the ability to take care of themselves, and thus have no means of fighting back. The only hope for the colony lies in the pilots of two planes equipped with 4th generation computers which DUO cannot control—they are controlled not by machinery, but by humans.</desc>

		<name>Volfied</name>
		<desc>Draw boxes to claim as much land as possible.

The space ship Monotros has returned after receiving an SOS call to save his home world (Volfied) from alien invaders and has to defeat a different boss and his minions in each level. Volfied is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an ship/object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along. When not cutting the ship is protected by a shield the shield decreases over time and when it hits zero the enemies can also killl you when not cutting.

The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points. Most levels contain power-up blocks these power-ups can be claimed when the area around it is removed. Possible power-ups are increased speed (S), time frees for the enemies (T), pause you shield from counting down (P), a laser to shoot the smaller enemies (L), all smaller enemies are killed instantly (C) and a weapon to kill the boss (a red tomato only found in blocks with the red light).

This game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</desc>

		<name>Vampire Savior 2: The Lord of Vampire</name>
		<desc>A Capcom fighter featuring supernatural monsters as fighters. Released in Japan in 1997, Vampire Savior 2 (ヴァンパイア セイヴァー 2, Vanpaia Seviā) was released along side Vampire Hunter 2 and uses the same gameplay mechanics as Vampire Savior. The game adds Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge characters Donovan Baine, Huitzil (Phobos in Japan) and Pyron to the Vampire Savior cast while omitting Jon Talbain (Gallon), Rikuo (Aulbath), and Sasquatch. Although the game was never official released in arcades outside of Japan, the game was incorporated into Darkstalkers 3 (Vampire Savior) and later as it's own standard game in the Japanese only release of Vampire: Darkstalkers Collection.

Vampire Savior 2 retains most of the cast has the characters Jon Talbain, Rikuo and Sasquatched removed from the roster and opening themes in order to incorporate Donovan Baine, Huitzil and Pyron. The default colors for CPU colors are different. Character specific boss fights are now repleaced with a singular boss fight against Jedah Dohma, with only Jedah himself receiving a unique ending. Pre-bosses fights are no longer varied but set so the player must fight Darkstalkers's original boss, Pyron.

Along side Shadow a new character, Marionette has been added. Marionette allows the player to fight in mirror matches throughout the game. Like Vampire Hunter 2, Shadow receives an addition 5 colors to his pallet and stages share the same recoloring. Oboro Bishamon is now a playable character through code input on the character select screen. Donovan's Night Warriors stage "Revenger Rooster" is readded and recolored as well.

Oddly and unlike Vampire Hunter 2, Vampire Savior 2 uses Night Warriors 's (Vampire Hunter in Japan) default color scheme for it's CPU characters while Vampire Hunter 2 uses Vampire Savior 's medium punch color scheme. Minor differences include health and EX/special bars colors and the font used for winning quotes.</desc>

World Heroes Perfect was released in May 1995. The game was feveloped by ADK. ADK's name is 'Alpha Denshi Kikaku'.

Son Gokuu is based on the famous mythological character known as Sun Wukong from "Journey to the West".

Since World Heroes Perfect, ADK games has gone out of business and all intellectual properties and copyrights to the games and characters have passed to SNK Playmore. Hanzo, Fuuma, Mudman and Neo-Dio would then appear in the fighting game "NeoGeo Battle Coliseum" (along with Kisarah from Aggressors of Dark Kombat, also by ADK) as a result.

- UPDATES -

In the Japanese version of the game, there is Japanese text underneath each players life bar during a fight displaying the player's taunts, yells and screams during a fight in text form. Combo information is also shown there when you do a combo. This feature is removed from non-Japanese versions of the game. This also occurred in World Heroes 2 Jet.

Flying Power Disc (c) 1994 Data East Corp.

A flying disk game from Data East.

Buttons: 2
=&gt; [A] Slide and receive/Throw, [B] Lob

- TRIVIA -

Flying Power Disc was released on February 17, 1994 in Japan.

This game is known outside Japan as Windjammers.

Each characters in game has his own native language (i.e. Costa says 'Perfecto').

Flying Power Disc contains 2 mini-games. After the second match, Dog Distance consists in catching the disc as far as possible with your dog. After the fourth match, Flying Disc Bowling allows us to make strikes and spares with the flying disc.

Flying Power Disc is based on the real world flying disc sport called '10-S'. But the inventor of the 10-S has never give permission or signed any agreement to allow Neo Geo or Data East to use 10-S as a model for Windjammers. It have never been compensated for the illegal use of 10-S rules and method of play. 10-S was created in 1977 and copyrighted in 1980.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Fighters History Dynamite &amp; Flying Power Disc - PCCB-00149) on March 18, 1994.

- UPDATES -

Curiously, B. Yoo of Korea is replaced with S. Miller of Britain only on the USA Territory dip switch setting. The sprites remain exactly the same, but the voice is changed to that of an Englishman.

		<desc>Warriors of Fate is a beat'em up with nine stages. Each contains large mobs including spearman, archers, strongmen, bomb-wielding opponents, and at least one Wei boss. There can be up to three players on-screen at the same time. Using two buttons, Attack and Jump, the characters all have standard moves typical of Capcom side-scrollers of the day. Common enemies including Wei soldiers such as bandits, privatees, wrestlers, fatties and thieves will keep popping up from everywhere. In the end of each stage there is a Wei general as stage bosses, e.g., Li Dian, Xiahou Dun, Xu Chu, Zhang Liao, Cao Ren, Xu Huang, the infamous Lu Bu as final boss. After defeating them all, there is also Cao Cao himself.

Feudal Chinese warriors fight for their lord against an evil warlord who is wreaking havoc and terror. Beaten opponents drop treasure, books and food which rejuvenate the combatants. Big bosses at the end of each level attempt to prevent your warriors from achieving their goals.

Warriors of Fate follows Liu Bei's plight in Jingzhou from Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a history-based novel of China, set in the Three Kingdoms period as Cao Cao sets to invade his lands. In Warriors of Fate, Shu Han, led by Liu Bei, as in the novel, was everything "good" and "righteous", while Wei, led by the ever suspicious and cunning Cao Cao, is portrayed as "evil" and "bad". Liu Bei's warriors begin by fighting Cao Cao's forces at the Battle of Bowang, then Battle of Changban, then finally join up with Sun Quan to fight at the Battle of Red Cliff.</desc>

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Xevious (c) 1982 Namco.

Xevious (pronounced 'zeevious') is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player pilots the heavily-armed 'Solvalou' combat ship and must destroy the evil Xevious forces trying to take over the planet. The Solvalou is equipped with two weapon systems; the forwards-firing "air zapper" for shooting air-based enemies and 'blaster bombs', for destroying ground-based enemies. To enable accurate targetting of the air-to-ground blaster bombs, a white and blue targeting indicator is situated in front of the Solvalou. This flashes when an enemy is in its sights.

Enemy craft appear in a number of different guises; from the standard variety that arrive in large numbers but shoot slow-moving projectiles, to exploding black spheres that shoot projectiles at high speed. There are also rotating shields that cannot be destroyed and must be carefully avoided. Ground enemies are a combination of both stationary bases and moving vehicles, most of which fire slow-moving projectiles. A gigantic, floating fortress called 'Andor Genesis' appears in certain areas; this is defeated by knocking out its core. 

Xevious is divided into 16 different areas, each separated by an area of forest. If the player dies before less than 70% of an area has been completed, play restarts at the beginning of the same area; should a life be lost AFTER 70% of an area has been completed, however, play restarts at the beginning of the next area. After Area 16 has been completed, the game loops back to Area 7.

The game becomes progressively more difficult as the player becomes more skilled - once the player does well at destroying a certain enemy type, a more advanced enemy type will replace it. This can be reverted by destroying flashing-red 'Zolback' radars found on the ground, which will cause the more advanced enemies to be replaced with weaker ones.

- TRIVIA -

Xevious was released in December 1982 in Japan.

Xevious is not the world's first vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up but has a huge and lasting influence on the genre.

Xevious was the first game to use pre-rendered graphics and, among its countless innovations, was also the first vertical shoot-em-up that allowed accurate targeting of both airborne and ground-based enemies. The graphics were hugely revolutionary for their time; the sprites were rendered with remarkable clarity and detail due to the game's clever use of colors and shades as well as palette-shifting. Xevious was also the first game to feature 'hidden characters', which, being hidden, are not mentioned in the game's instructions but can be revealed by performing a secret maneuver. Among these was the 'special flag', which gave the player an extra life. This feature was carried over to a number of subsequent Namco games. 

While Xevious enjoyed limited popularity in North America, the game was a huge cult hit in Japan, and to this day is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Popular Japanese musicians, Haruomi Hosono (Yellow Magic Orchestra) and Kuwata Keisuke (Southern All Stars) were known to be fans of the game, and the former produced an album of music from Namco video games, with Xevious as its centerpiece. A follow-up 12-inch single featured in its liner notes an entire science-fiction short story by Endoh, set in the world of Xevious, with even included a rudimentary fictional language. 

At one point in the game, the Solvalou flies over the Nazca lines. The Nazca Lines are geoglyphs (drawings on the ground) located in the Nazca Desert; a high, arid plateau that stretches 37 miles between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, situated in the Pampa region. They were created during the Nazca occupation of the area, between 200 BC and 600 AD. 

The graphic ROMs contain several additional enemies which don't actually appear in gameplay including a silver-grey Galaxian flagship. These enemies do appear in the game-play of "Super Xevious" which uses the same graphics data as Xevious. 

The highest score possible is 9,999,990, at which point the game terminates abnormally and resets. Some time before this score is reached, the game starts to award extra ships on every blaster shot fired. 

Marco Borroni holds the official official record for this game with 7,009,560 points (!) on August 16, 1984. 

The background is actually one large 1024x2048 image. Each of the 16 game areas is a 224x2048 strip starting at a different horizontal offset in the image.

- UPDATES -

* The high-score names are ten characters long on the Namco versions, but only three characters long on the Atari versions. 

* The Zapper and Blaster buttons were reversed between the Japanese and American versions.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When you start the game, your Solvalou will be at the bottom of the screen. Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the top and no slower then the bottom of the screen. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick up and down. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control.

* One interesting aspect of this game is the fact if you are too successful against a particular kind of enemy, the game will adjust itself to send different enemies until you have difficulty dealing with them.

* Make sure you know what you will be encountering in each area.

* If you hold down the fire and bomb buttons, you will constantly be doing both at a slower rate. This is great when you are in the thick of things with both air and ground targets swarming the area.

* Speaking of bombs, your Solvalou is equipped with smart bombs (so to speak). They are launch and forget weapons. When you 'paint' the target with your bomb-sight and launch your bomb, it will hit that target even when you have already flown over it. There are a couple of strategies to make your bombing runs more effective:
1) When you have targets close together (usually bomb batteries are arranged this way), put a bomb between them. You will have a very good chance of taking out both batteries with one hit since you can only have one bomb on the screen at a time.
2) For moving targets (such as Grobdas), anticipate the targets direction and 'lead' it a little. This basically means putting the bomb at the point where the target will run into it.
3) Your bomb-sight will turn red whenever any target is 'sighted', even if the target is hidden like Sol Citadels and flags.

* Keep away from the corners. These can become death traps real quickly if you are swamped by enemies.

* Since you have free reign of most of the screen to move around, make sure you use all that room for maneuvering. Enemy fighters have a nasty habit of either shooting from behind your fighter or re-entering the screen from random sides. It also is handy when you are dodging a heavy volume of enemy fire.

* Make sure when you are maneuvering around the Bacuras, you always leave yourself a clear 'out'.  What I mean by this is there another direction to escape instead of having to move along with the Bacuras. An occasional enemy likes to put up shots at your fighter since it is very difficult to maneuver around the rolling plates.

* The Andor Genesis Motherships are pretty easy to destroy if you work quickly. Most of the time, Zakatos and Brag Zakatos precede the arrival of the Andor Genesis Mothership. Blast these out of the sky and avoid the shrapnel. When the Andor Genesis Mothership appears, lead the target a little and quickly move up and plant your bomb at the point the center of the ship will be. The less time you waste taking on this ship, the better.

* Secret Message: The designer of Xevious has included a trick for generating his name right at the beginning of the game. When Solvalou appears, move to the right edge of the screen, wait a few seconds and drop a single bomb as soon as the music changes (after the long note). The message 'Namco ORIGINAL Program by EVEZOO' will appear on the screen.

* THE FLAGS: There are four flags hidden throughout the game. These flags occur in areas 1, 3, 5, and 6. All flags are along a horizontal line across the terrain. The only way to uncover a flag is to bomb it so you will have to lay a string of bombs along the entire horizontal line. This basically means moving up quickly, dealing with enemies quickly, and dropping your bombs quickly. Once a flag is uncovered, you must fly over it to get the benefits from it.

FLAG 1: The first flag is located in the first river you encounter after you start the game. Look for the three Grobdas in a row. Just above them is a river that cuts horizontally across the terrain. Just bomb the river from left to right and around the bank closest to you. The flag should appear.

FLAG 2: After you get past the plates, look up and to the right. There is a little lake with a small river feeding into the ocean. Start in the middle of the lake and bomb toward the little river. The flag should appear around where the river dumps into the ocean.

FLAG 3: When you cross the first ocean, you will eventually see a dock/harbor at the top. The flag is located around the horizontal line that the longest pier projecting out is part of. You will need to quickly bomb that entire length to find and get the flag before the bottom scrolls your Solvalou too far up.

FLAG 4: You will see a big bird picture on the desert. At the lowest point of its tail-feathers (in the lower right corner), start to bomb horizontally from right to left. The flag will appear.

* Sol Citadels: These structures require you to bomb them once to cause them to surface. They look like large storage tanks or grain silos. You then need to bomb them again to destroy them. You have a potential to collect several hundred thousand points by taking out these structures. They come in groups of 1, 4, or 8. Unlike flags, these structures are always in the same place. There are six sets of Sol Citadels.

FIRST SET: One in area 2. When you see the three Grobdas in a row on the road, start laying bombs in the area around the cul-de-sac below the last tank in a right and diagonal-down point. The citadel will be even with the cul-de-sac.

SECOND SET: One in area 3. When you see the Garu Bara, go to the left of the Garu Bara and start bombing. This is also the area that the second flag can be found.

THIRD SET: Four in area 9. There is a clear area right before you tangle with the second Andor Genesis Mothership. Where the road splits around the woods, start to lay bombs a little below the bottom edge of the road that goes to the right. You should uncover four Sol Citadels.

FOURTH SET: Eight in area 13. At the point the desert ends, there is a little grass, then the air field starts. Use the birds leg as a reference and fly straight up. When the bomb-sight glows, start bombing. This will be the lower left Sol Citadel of the group which is arranged in two rows of four citadels. You will be hard pressed to get all eight citadels.

FIFTH SET: Four in area 14. After the plates roll by, look for where two roads merge into one road. At the top edge of the slanted right hand road, start dropping bombs to uncover some more citadels.

SIXTH SET: Four in area 15. Look for a forest on the left side. There will be a small clearing and then a river. Bomb the small clearing to bring the citadels up. There will be very intense ground fire in this location so be especially watchful.

		<name>X-Men: Children of the Atom</name>
		<desc>Ten mutant heroes and villians compete in one-on-one combat to decide the fate of the world. Each hero and villian has special powers that can be unleashed upon opponents. Play culminates after defeating the two mutant bosses, The Juggernaut and Magneto.

Based upon the popular comic book series X-Men by Marvel Comics, this game gives the players the opportunity to pit their favorite mutant heroes and villians against one another. The game play is similar to that of the Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams series. Players can control either one of the six X-Men (Cyclops, Storm, Ice Man, Colossus, Psylocke, and Wolverine), or one of their four evil adversaries (Silver Samurai, Spiral, The Sentinel, and Omega Red). Once their characters have been selected, the players will meet each of the other nine opponents in one-on-one combat.

After defeating all the opponents, a player's mutant will go head-to-head with the two bosses, The Juggernaut and Magneto. Like in Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams, each mutant has a special power that can be unleashed upon opponents by performing certain combinations of button and joystick movements. The amount of damage a mutant's special power will do depends upon the amount of energy the character has stored up in his power meter. Energy is stored in the power meter when your mutant is hit, blocks a hit, or attacks his opponent.</desc>

		<name>Zupapa!</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 21 years ago:

Zupapa! (c) 2001 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

In this whimsical action game, you take control of an uber cute, long-eared, boxing-gloves wearing hero and his 4 little sidekicks (called 'Zooks' by the way!) in order to tackle colorful yet dangerous enemies in fun looking worlds such as Nightmare Land, Circus Land, Toy Land, Jungle Land, Dino Land, Japan Land, Sci-fi Land, Dragon Land &amp; Virtual Land! Features very colorful graphics, nicely animated characters, fun bonus stages to mix things up and a simple yet really catchy soundtrack! Grab a friend for some truly awesome platforming fun!

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-070

Players: 2
Control: 8-Way Joystick
Buttons: 2
=&gt; [A] Punch/Toss Zooks, [B] Jump

- TRIVIA -

This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware and was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.

On February 22, 1994, SNK third party developer Face debuted Zupapa at the AOU Show in Japan, however the game was released by SNK for its MVS system in 2001. That is the reason the game was long thought to be a prototype-only title! So far, this is the only NeoGeo un-released prototype game that finally saw an actual official release.

The game was finally released a few months after the 'success' of "Nightmare in the Dark" (because they are very similar, only graphics and levels change). They are so close that some players consider that Nightmare in the Dark is the adult version of the game (with dark graphics) and Zupapa the children version (with its cute animations).

This is one of the very few Neo Geo games that does not show the names of its developers at the ending, it also deems this title as Episode 1 but chances of a sequel are next to none! Too bad...:(

Default highscore table (RANKING):
RANK NAME SCORE
1st KAT 100000
2nd GON 80000
3rd OKI 60000
4th SET 40000
5th HAR 20000

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* You can find a few power-ups in the different levels:
S: Increase Zupapa's speed.
P: Increase Zupapa's power.
J: Add points whenever Zupapa jumps.
A: Add points whenever Zupapa punches.
X2: Double the score of all score items.

* Destroy all enemies in any stage with a single Zook Bomb in order to be rewarded with a golden Zupapa trophy!

* Do not throw the Zooks if you do not need to, otherwise they will run away from you making the current stage more tricky to clear!

* After clearing the first world, when you start playing in the second world, at the end of each round when you've killed all the enemies, you are given a few seconds before being warped to the next stage. During this time you can keep jumping or pushing the punch button. Every time you push any of the buttons, you are awarded 100 points. Quite good for making high-score rewards.

* When you throw those small kids at the enemies and they are out cold for a few seconds, try to kill them by touching them when several other enemies are in the needed radius, this will of course kill that enemy but also kill the others in the certain radius and you'll get extra fruits hence bonus.

* Beat the game without continuing to see an extra congratulatory image in the ending.

		<name>Mahjong Electron Base (parts 2 &amp; 4, Japan, Bet)</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 30 years ago:

Mahjong Electron Base Part.2 + Part.4 (c) 1993 Dynax.

A classic Mahjong BET game ever with strict score system and function of 'Three Tiles Exchange'. A special effect of Ron or Reach is shown when announced. Play with six girls and wonderful background music.

Players: 1

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When the notice of 'Three Tiles Exchange available' is shown during game, skip it first by pressing the start button. Then play the game normally until the gal throws her last tile out. Keep pressing the 'DonDen' button for almost 40-50 times and 'Three Tiles Exchange available' will appear again. The other two chances of exchange will come after pressing the button 4-6 times each. Attempt to make your whole tile group to match the opponent's last tile after exchange then a Ron of Yakuman can be achieved. It will be easier to fulfil this trick if the girls last tile is forced to be the one expected.

		<desc>A cartridge-based arcade system board. The MVS stands for Multi Video System, and as its name suggest, offers owners the ability to put up to six different arcade titles into a single cabinet, a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace. With its games stored on self-contained cartridges, a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game's ROM-cartridge and cabinet artwork.</desc>

		<desc>There are 12 playable fighters to choose from and two boss characters. The object of the game is to win two matches out of three. Each character has a set of moves in addition to two basic punches and kicks. Players also have the ability to taunt others, but unlike games such as SNK's Art of Fighting series, this has no effect and would actually leave the player open to attacks.

In single player mode, after selecting a character, the player must also select an opponent. The opponent order cycles randomly according to the character select screen. After the first twelve are defeated, the player must defeat two bosses, Powell and Mahesvara. Unlike Fight Fever, there is a 2-on-2 team mode, where players can choose two characters whether in certain order or randomly. The camera also zooms in and out depending on how far apart the characters are, like in the Art of Fighting series.</desc>
