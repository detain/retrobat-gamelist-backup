Mahjong Electron Base Part.2 + Part.4 (c) 1993 Dynax.

A classic Mahjong BET game ever with strict score system and function of 'Three Tiles Exchange'. A special effect of Ron or Reach is shown when announced. Play with six girls and wonderful background music.

Main CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 5.5 Mhz)
Sound Chips: General Instrument AY8910 (@ 2.75 Mhz), YM2413 (@ 3.58 Mhz), OKI MSM5205 (@ 384 Khz)

Screen orientation: Horizontal
Video resolution: 512 x 240 pixels
Screen refresh: 60.00 Hz
Palette colors: 4096

Players: 1

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When the notice of 'Three Tiles Exchange available' is shown during game, skip it first by pressing the start button. Then play the game normally until the gal throws her last tile out. Keep pressing the 'DonDen' button for almost 40-50 times and 'Three Tiles Exchange available' will appear again. The other two chances of exchange will come after pressing the button 4-6 times each. Attempt to make your whole tile group to match the opponent's last tile after exchange then a Ron of Yakuman can be achieved. It will be easier to fulfil this trick if the girls last tile is forced to be the one expected.

		<desc>A cartridge-based arcade system board. The MVS stands for Multi Video System, and as its name suggest, offers owners the ability to put up to six different arcade titles into a single cabinet, a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace. With its games stored on self-contained cartridges, a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game's ROM-cartridge and cabinet artwork.</desc>

		<desc>There are 12 playable fighters to choose from and two boss characters. The object of the game is to win two matches out of three. Each character has a set of moves in addition to two basic punches and kicks. Players also have the ability to taunt others, but unlike games such as SNK's Art of Fighting series, this has no effect and would actually leave the player open to attacks.

In single player mode, after selecting a character, the player must also select an opponent. The opponent order cycles randomly according to the character select screen. After the first twelve are defeated, the player must defeat two bosses, Powell and Mahesvara. Unlike Fight Fever, there is a 2-on-2 team mode, where players can choose two characters whether in certain order or randomly. The camera also zooms in and out depending on how far apart the characters are, like in the Art of Fighting series.</desc>

- TRIVIA -

This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware and was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.

On February 22, 1994, SNK third party developer Face debuted Zupapa at the AOU Show in Japan, however the game was released by SNK for its MVS system in 2001. That is the reason the game was long thought to be a prototype-only title! So far, this is the only NeoGeo un-released prototype game that finally saw an actual official release.

The game was finally released a few months after the 'success' of "Nightmare in the Dark" (because they are very similar, only graphics and levels change). They are so close that some players consider that Nightmare in the Dark is the adult version of the game (with dark graphics) and Zupapa the children version (with its cute animations).

This is one of the very few Neo Geo games that does not show the names of its developers at the ending, it also deems this title as Episode 1 but chances of a sequel are next to none! Too bad...:(

Default highscore table (RANKING):
RANK NAME SCORE
1st KAT 100000
2nd GON 80000
3rd OKI 60000
4th SET 40000
5th HAR 20000

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* You can find a few power-ups in the different levels:
S: Increase Zupapa's speed.
P: Increase Zupapa's power.
J: Add points whenever Zupapa jumps.
A: Add points whenever Zupapa punches.
X2: Double the score of all score items.

* Destroy all enemies in any stage with a single Zook Bomb in order to be rewarded with a golden Zupapa trophy!

* Do not throw the Zooks if you do not need to, otherwise they will run away from you making the current stage more tricky to clear!

* After clearing the first world, when you start playing in the second world, at the end of each round when you've killed all the enemies, you are given a few seconds before being warped to the next stage. During this time you can keep jumping or pushing the punch button. Every time you push any of the buttons, you are awarded 100 points. Quite good for making high-score rewards.

* When you throw those small kids at the enemies and they are out cold for a few seconds, try to kill them by touching them when several other enemies are in the needed radius, this will of course kill that enemy but also kill the others in the certain radius and you'll get extra fruits hence bonus.

* Beat the game without continuing to see an extra congratulatory image in the ending.

1942 (c) 1984 Capcom.

1942 is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Pacific theatre during World War II, in which the goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet. 

The player pilots a plane dubbed the 'Super Ace' and has to shoot down waves of enemy planes while avoiding incoming enemy fire. The 'Super Ace' can perform a limited number of rolls or 'loop-the-loops' to evade enemy planes and shots. Just two lives are given to the player.

During the game, waves of red enemy planes periodically appear. If the player manages to destroy a red wave, a power-up, in the form of a 'POW' symbol, will be dropped and can be picked up. The power-up will award either increased fire-power (doubling the player's guns from two to four), a smart bomb that destroys all on-screen enemy planes the instant it's collected, two wingmen planes that flank the Super Ace and increase fire power, or simply extra points.

At the end of each stage the 'Super Ace' lands on an aircraft carrier and bonus points are awarded based on player performance. 1942 differs from other games in that its levels are numbered in reverse order, so the game begins at stage 32 and ends at stage 1.

- TRIVIA -

1942 was released in December 1984 in Japan. 1942 wasn't a Yoshiki Okamoto title, but designed by his former-classmate who joined Capcom a few years afterwards.

The plane is a lockheed P-38 Lightning, the same type which was flown by Richard Bong in the Second World War. He was America's top ace, credited with shooting down 40 Japanese planes.

It was the first Capcom title to spawn a successful series of sequels, with six titles in the 19XX line released from 1984 to 2000.

Stage names:
Stages 32–29: Midway
Stages 28–25: Marshall

Stages 20–17: Rabaul
Stages 16–13: Leyte
Stages 12–09: Saipan
Stages 08–05: Iwojima
Stages 04–01: Okinawa

After the last boss plane on stage 02 is destroyed the screen displays: 
CONGRATULATION
YOU ARE THE BEST OF PLAYER !
FIGHT LAST ONE STAGE

Stage 01 is displayed as LAST STAGE.

After the last stage is complete the screen displays: 
WE GIVE UP!

2ND 35000 ALL 0
3RD 30000 RIGHT 0
4TH 25000 RESERVED 0
5TH 20000 EXEDEXES 0

In the default high-score table, some previous Capcom Games appear. Since the Demo Mode only shows the top five, you need to play the game and to make a score of approximately 10,000 points (To enter in the top ten).
The number 5 (20,000 points) appears as 'EXEDEXES'.
Number 6 is 'VULGUS' (9,999 points).
Number 7 is 'SONSON' (8,888 points).
Number 8 is 'HIGEMARU' (7,777 points).
Number 9 is again 'EXEDEXES' (6,666 points).

The game ROM contains an unused Bomb sprite and an unused Star bonus items sprite.

Martin Bedard of Saint-Lazare, Quebec, Canada holds the record for this game with 13,360,960 points on November 19, 2006.

- UPDATES -

In the two oldest versions of the game, there's a bug in the scoring system for earning bonus lives. This bug was fixed in Revision B.

- SCORING -

Small planes are 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, or 200 points each.

The small red planes that fly formations of five or ten are 100 points each. Shooting all the planes in the five-plane formation awards 500 bonus points. Shooting all the planes in the ten-plane formation awards 1,000 bonus points. In both cases, when the last plane of a formation is destroyed, a power-up marker appears and is worth 1,000 points when picked up.

Occasionally a small airplane comes slowly out of the lower left or lower right hand side of the screen and flies towards the top. When hit, it turns into a special figure which awards 5,000 points when picked up.

Medium size planes are 1,000 or 1,500 points each.

Large bomber planes start at 2,000 points each. The score for each consecutive bomber destroyed without the player dying is 500 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 9,000 points. When the player’s ship is destroyed, the score for the bombers is reset back to 2,000 points.

There are four boss planes. They appear at the end of stages 26, 18, 10, and 02:
The stage 26 boss plane is worth 20,000 points.
The stage 18 boss plane is worth 30,000 points.
The stage 10 boss plane is worth 40,000 points.
The stage 02 boss plane is worth 50,000 points.

For all enemy planes that require more than one hit to kill, each hit on them gives 100 points.

At the end of each stage a bonus is awarded for shooting down percentage and for unused loops:
100% = Special bonus 50,000 points (in older revisions, the game displays 10,000 points bonus but 50,000 points are actually awarded).
95-99% = 20,000 points
90-94% = 10,000 points
85-89% = 5,000 points
80-84% = 4,000 points
70-79% = 3,000 points
60-69% = 2,000 points
50-59% = 1,000 points
Under 50% = 0 points
Unused loops are 1,000 points each.

Finishing the final stage awards 10,000,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* On Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04, a V-formation of red planes will come straight down from the top. If all five of the planes are destroyed, a Black/Red POW appears, giving the player an extra airplane when picked up.

* On stages with the wingman power-ups, use them to kill off the large bombers easily by crashing a wingman into them. You will get a second chance to get them back later on.

* On the stages with the boss planes, save all your loops; shoot at it quickly, loop down to avoid the shots, shoot at it again and THEN loop. You should be able to kill it this way.

* Most of the time it is easier to keep only one wingman rather than both; that way it's easier to maneuver around enemies. If you miss the red airplanes that give you the wingman powerup, kill off your plane (assuming you have some remaining) and the game will place you back before them.

* An interesting bug: If you win an extra plane from points when killing a boss plane, no extra planes will be awarded on the basis of points. Extra planes can still be obtained by getting the Black/Red POW, but no point-based bonuses will be awarded for the rest of the game.

* The end of stage bonus for 100% shooting down is actually 50,000 points, even though the game displays a 'special' bonus of only 10,000 points.

When the player loses all of his ships, the game offers to continue for another credit. If this option is chosen, the game continues where it left off but the score is reset to zero.

* There are six kinds of powerups: Quad fire, destroy all enemies on screen, two wingmen, make enemies stop shooting temporarily, extra loop, and extra life. Note that the destroy all enemies powerup does not destroy the small slow plane that has the 5,000 bonus item pickup.

Quad fire power-ups are found on Stages 32, 28, 24, 20, 16, 12, 08, and 04.
Destroy all enemies power-ups are found on Stages 31, 21, 19, 18, 11, 07, 03, and 01.
Wingman power-ups are found on Stages 30, 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 06, and 02.
Extra life power-ups are found on Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04.
Stop shooting power-ups are found on Stages 27 and 15. 
Extra loop power-ups are found on Stages 23, 18, 17, 13, 09, and 05.

* % and point up Stages are 29, 25, 21, 17, 13, 09, 05, 01. During these stages none of the enemies fire on the player except the large bomber planes.

* If the player earns enough bonus planes so that ten ships or more are in the reserve, the ten remaining ships indicators are replaced by the Greek letter Sigma (?).

2020 Super Baseball (c) 1991 SNK Corporation.

There is no longer conventional baseball in 2020. The Super Baseball designed by the SUPER BASEBALL ASSOCIATION has been very popular and is the best sport. However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball.

Finally, a fair game in going to be played at "CYBER EGG"!

FUTURISTIC SUPER BASEBALL, NOW PLAY BALL!

2020 Super Baseball:
1. Futuristic Graphics
2. Select 1 of 12 individual teams of men, women &amp; robot players.

5. 2 players simultaneous competition with CONTINUE mode.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* How to Play:
Hitting: 
[A] Swing/Return to base
[B] Stolen Base/Lead off
[C] Bunt
[D] Time Out

Fielding: 
[A] Pitch/Throw ball/Jump
[B] Base touch/Feint ball
[C] x
[D] Time out

* There is no infield fly rule in this game, which can be used to the advantage of a defender if there are base runners. Double plays and even triple plays are common because of this.

* A base runner cannot begin to steal bases until the pitcher has released the ball. In most baseball video games and in real life, a runner can begin to steal the next base at any time. However, stealing a base beforehand can only be done if you continuously press the steal button right after the screen cuts-back after the batter hit a foul ball, and the pitcher will not even notice you running.

* The 3rd baseman, 2nd baseman, and 1st baseman will not leave the base to retrieve a ball. They will instead stand on the base and wait for another fielder to get the ball, which can sometimes mean they will stand there while the ball rolls inches away from them. The only exception would be if the shortstop covers third or second base for the fielder; then they remain in the stationary position.

* Since the game has semi-automatic fielding, you cannot change which defensive player you want to run after the ball, which means sometimes the pitcher will end up chasing a ball well into the outfield.

* If a ball is hit far enough into the stands, it can sometimes become stuck, allowing the batter to garnish an in the park home run. Because of the reduced home run zone, faster players can often round the bases by hitting the ball up into the fair-zone stands.

* The computer players will always attempt to hit the ball straight, as if trying to hit a home run, no matter what the strength of the batter. This can sometimes give an unfair advantage to you, since they do not try to pull the ball just barely fair in order to get a hit. This has its downfall, in that some powerful players will hit home runs easily.

* You cannot play against a team from the other league.

* If you manage to score more than 100 runs, your score will turn back to zero, as there are only two spaces for your runs. Consequently, if you score 101 runs, and your opponent scores two runs, you will lose the game 01-02.

* You cannot change players positions in the field or line up without replacing them.

* If another player is in your line of path to throw the ball, they will catch the ball after you throw it. This means that if the shortstop retrieves a ground ball just behind 3rd base, then the throw will get cut-off by the 3rd baseman and then the pitcher before the ball gets to 1st base. The pitcher will almost always get in the way, and this can present a problem when trying to pull a double play between third and first or second and home.

- TRIVIA -

Fire Suplex was released on March 25, 1993 in Japan. It was developed by UPL and this is the last game developed by this manufacturer.

This game is known outside Japan as 3 Count Bout.

Fire Suplex is the only 'true' wrestling game for the SNK MVS Neo-Geo hardware but not the first. This honor goes to "King of The Monsters" (with giant monsters anyway!):)

Blues Hablam and Blubber Man are actually the same guy with the same ring attire, only Hablam sports a mask. The same occurs for Gochack Bigbomb and Big Bomberdir with Bigbomb wearing the mask.

The character Master Barnes enters the ring wearing Shoulder Spikes similar to the ones worn by legendary wrestling tag-team The Road Warriors.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 35 years ago:

After Burner II (c) 1987 Sega.

After Burner is another Sega game rendered with their then-ubiquitous 3-D sprite-scaling technology; this time putting the player into the seat of a powerful F14 Tomcat jet fighter. 

Players must fight their way through 21 colourful, fast-moving stages, shooting down waves of enemy fighters while avoiding the enemy's incoming missiles. The F14 is equipped with a machine gun and a limited number of homing missiles. The gun has infinite ammunition and targeting is achieved by maneuvering the Tomcat so that the targeting cursor situated just in front of the jet is placed over an enemy fighter. 

To deploy missiles, the player must first 'lock-on' to the target, a sound will indicate that the lock has taken place and missiles should then be fired, these will home in on and destroy the locked-on enemy fighter. 

Missile stocks are replenished at the end of every 2nd stage, either by the appearance of a large support plane that automatically links up with the player's jet fighter, or by landing on a military airstrip - which again happens automatically. 

After Burner's straightforward shoot-em-up gameplay is simple and repetitive, but the game's incredible visuals ensured its success.

- TRIVIA -

After Burner II was released in October 1987.

After Burner II was originally planned to have a World War II theme and be a realistic flight sim, but the idea was dropped because Yu Suzuki stated that 'it would not have fit the arcade scene.' A pure dogfighter was not his intention.

ABII is essentially the same game as "After Burner", but there are a few differences, mainly the fact that it is possible to control your plane speed.

In the cut-scenes that show your jet fighter landing on a landing strip in order to reload the missile supply, there are some special vehicles that will make a cameo appearance. In the first landing, you'll see a man riding the motorcycle from "Hang-On". and in the second landing, you'll see the famous Ferrari Testarossa-like car from "Out Run".

David Hernly holds the record for this game with 2,215,620 points on June 1, 2008.

- TRIVIA -

On November 23, 1982, Eric Olofson holds the official World Record for this game with 500,774 points at Earth Station One Arcade in Antioch, Ca.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Here's A Way To Get Ridiculously High Scores In Alpine Ski: Go thru the downhill section with the points flags very slowly and avoid collecting positive points:
1) There's some point in the course (should be easy to find) where there's a negative points flag near trees that can be crashed into. This trick is best done here.
2) Collect negative points to roll your score back under zero. You will be granted massive time on the massive points you have. Unfortunately, time will be taken off at an incredible rate.
3) Run over the negative points flag as necessary to get rid of the points you win just by moving forward and crashing into the nearby trees.
4) Repeat Step 4 until you've run out of time. You now have a completely unbeatable high-score which (if it were 1981) people would beg you to tell them how you did it.
WARNING: ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY DON'T GO BACK ACROSS ZERO OR YOUR GAME WILL END IMMEDIATELY!!!

		<name>Amidar</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 41 years ago:

Amidar (c) 1981 Konami.

Amidar is an abstract arcade game in which players must 'colour in' all of the rectangles on the screen. Each level has a number of patrolling enemies called 'Amidars' that must be avoided but players are aided in their task with the inclusion of a JUMP button which, when used, causes all the on-screen enemies to jump, giving the player time to escape. There are only three 'jumps' given per level, however.

On odd-numbered levels, the player's character is a gorilla who eats coconuts; on even-numbered levels, it's a paint roller. The game's enemy Amidars are savages and pigs respectively. Whenever a rectangular portion of the board is cleared (either by collecting all surrounding coconuts, or painting all surrounding edges), the rectangle is coloured in and on the even levels, bonus points are awarded, while on the odd-numbered levels, points are awarded for each coconut eaten. 

If players manage to fill in all four corner rectangles of a board, they are briefly able to kill the enemies by touching them (similar to the 'Power-pill' from Namco's Pac-Man series). Enemies killed in this way fall to the bottom of the screen and recover after a few seconds.

On the even-numbered paint roller levels, the roller cannot move too far from grid rectangles that have already been filled without running out of paint and having to return to completed parts of the map to refresh its supply. When this happens, any painted lines that are not part of a filled rectangle will vanish and must be painted again. This means that the player must build their completed squares around the starting point of the level and spread outwards, rather than completing squares on any part of the board as they can on the odd-numbered Gorilla levels. This makes filling in the corner rectangles to become invincible much more difficult.

In between levels players are given the possibility of earning 5,000 bonus points. Here, an Amidar moves across the top of the screen, by pushing the jump button the Amidar traces a random path down towards the bottom of the screen. If the Amidar reaches a bunch of bananas, a bonus is awarded.

- TRIVIA -

Amidar was released in October 1981 in Japan.

The word Amidar comes from Amidakuji, a Japanese classic method of lottery that looks like ladders. It is designed to create random pairings of arbitrary numbers of two sets of start points and goals, each with an equal number of elements.

Todd Lamb holds the official record for this game with 19,225,030 points.

- UPDATES -

Japanese version: Worse attract mode and does not display the number of jumps left. Also higher scoring (20 points per coconut/segment).

- SCORING -

Collecting a coconut or painting a segment: 10 points.
Filling in a box with the paintbrush: the score in the centre of the box - 100 to 700 points.
Killing the Amidars and Tracer after filling in the corner boxes: 100 points, 200 points, 400 points, 800 points, 1,600 points, etc. 3,200 is the maximum on later levels (only in the Japanese version).
Collecting the bonus banana on the interim level: 5,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The Tracer always follows the outside edge and is easy to avoid. Try to ensure it is within range when you complete the fourth corner box of the maze, making it easy to kill.

* The Amidars all have a set movement pattern, which is detailed by the 'Amidar movement' on the title screen. They only move in 4 ways:
a) up/right
b) up/left
c) down/right
d) down/left.
They will follow their current pattern of movement (a, b, c or d) until they reach the edge of the maze when they move round the edge of the last box they contact and continue with their new pattern. e.g. Up/right to the top right of the maze, round the last box and then down/left to the bottom left corner. Mastering their pattern of movement is the key to success!

* If all Amidars are close to the bottom of the screen on the coconuts level, they will take a while to make it to the top. Use this time to clear as much of the top area as you can.

* Remember you have three jumps available on each level so make use of them to get yourself out of a tight corner. Two quick jumps if used in succession will easily give you enough time to get well clear of any danger.

龍虎の拳 (c) 1992 SNK Corp.
(Ryuuko no Ken)

An early Neo-Geo martial arts fighting game with 2 selectable characters in 1-player mode and 8 selectable characters in 2-player mode which also features a long-nosed end boss. Progressive damage is shown on each fighter's face for a dramatic effect.

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.

- TRIVIA -

Ryuuko no Ken was released in September 1992 in Japan.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Dragon and Tiger Fist'.

This game is known outside Japan as Art of fighting" 

A bootleg of this game is known as "Fit of Fighting".

SNK's second fighting-game franchise. It was the first fighting game by SNK to feature the character designs of former SNK illustrator Shinkiro, who would go on to do the character designs for the later "Fatal Fury" and "The King of Fighters" games.

This is the first fighting game to feature the 'camera zoom' - where the camera zooms in when the fighters are close together and zooms out when the fighters move away from each other. This is also the first fighting game to utilize a 'spirit meter'. Every time a special move is executed the spirit meter is depleted accordingly. The more powerful the special move, the more it depletes. When it's empty special moves can't be done anymore, however, you can recharge the spirit meter by standing still and holding the A or B button leaving you totally defenseless.

Robert Garcia design was inspired by the famous actor Steven Seagal.
Takuma Sakazaki desgin was inspired by Masutatsu Oyama.

The Haou Shokou Ken was referred to as the Haou Ken (or as the game put it, the 'Haow-Ken'). Its similarity to Ryu's (of "Street Fighter" fame) Hadou Ken forced the name change.

The character's fighting stance and their victory pose depends on how beaten up they are.

Lee Pai Long is called Lee Piron in the game's source code.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Todoh, Jack, Lee, King, Micky and John: player 2 must join.

* Play as Mr. Big and Mr. Karate: reach them on 1P Game, then player 2 must join.

* Move Command Delay: its possible to input the commands for any special or super move but it is not necessary to press the corresponding attack button right away, this allows you to delay any move for as long as you want in order to surprise an opponent! This trick also enables you to perform slower versions of some special moves such as projectile attacks. Try it!:)

龍虎の拳2 (c) 1994 SNK Corp.
(Ryuuko no Ken 2)

12 selectable characters are available in this martial arts fighting game, each showing progressive damage on their bodies during the fight.

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.

- TRIVIA -

Ryuuko no Ken 2 was released in March 1994 in Japan.

This game is known outide Japan as Art of Fighting 2.

Geese Howard's guest appearance (see 'Tips And Tricks' section) tries to tie this game's story with the Fatal Fury games. Apparently, this game takes place a few years before the events occurred in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" since Geese looks quite young and uses a very different fighting style (instead of his trademark Aikido which he learned in Japan). Another fact is the special ending when you defeat Geese (you get to see when he gives the order to eliminate Jeff Bogard who happens to be Terry &amp; Andy Bogard's father, before he heads to Japan to learn that country's martial art techniques). This fact also explains why Ryo Sakazaki is so damn powerful in his "Fatal Fury Special" appearance (after all, he was already a powerful &amp; skilled fighter and has had more time than most of the Fatal Fury characters to brush up on his techniques!). Obviously, all these storyline details were ignored in the King of Fighters series for the sake of convenience (All the "Art of Fighting" characters should be way older than the Fatal Fury characters in that game!).

In Temjin's ending, Terry Bogard makes a guest appearance as a little boy!

- UPDATES -

The Japanese version features different voice actors for some characters (John Crawley, Robert Garcia &amp; King).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Adjust the game difficulty setting up to level 8 in order to boost game's overall speed!

It may be downright cheap &amp; silly, but if you successfully manage to throw an opponent and then hit him with a special move as he gets up, you will dizzy your opponent! This can be done over and over again with most characters...:/

Beat opponents with a special move at the end of the decisive round to see a special 'defeat' animation (some auto-combos &amp; special moves that lift the opponent of the ground won't work though).

Defeat all opponents in two rounds only to fight a special battle against Fatal Fury's main villain &amp; owner of Southtown: Geese Howard (Notice that it is possible to use continues &amp; use different characters as long as you defeat your opponents in 'two rounds only'!).:)

Arabian Magic (c) 1992 Taito Corporation.

Arabian Magic is a scrolling beat-em-up for one to four players, set in the mythical world of The Arabian Nights. A long time ago, an evil wizard has taken over the peaceful kingdom of Shahariyard and used sorcery to transform its king into a Monkey. The player must defeat each of the game's seven Guardians to reclaim the 'Jewel of Seven Colours' and release the king from the evil hex. 

Each player can select from four distinctive characters: Prince Lassid, Princess Lisa, Sinbad or Afshael. Each character carries a primary weapon - Prince Lassid and Sinbad carry swords, Princess Lisa a magical veil and Afshael a mace. In addition to the weapons, players can also summon a magical attack in the form of a huge genie. The genie will only appear for a few seconds but during that time, players have control over the genie and can steer him towards enemies. 

Arabian Magic has seven different stages with one of the powerful guardians awaiting the player at the end of each level. Each guardian, once defeated, will drop a jewel which forms a part of the Jewel of Seven Colours. Guardians, once defeated, will join the player and become a Genie. Each level is littered with vases and wooden chests which, when broken, reveal treasure items and power-ups. 

The game ends when the player has recovered the Jewel of Seven Colours, saved the King (making him human in the process) and restored peace to Shahariyard.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Characters list
Princess Lisa can defeat enemies at a distance. She has only a small amount of health, but has powerful attacks. Her spinning attack is lethal. 
Sinbad possesses the greatest of all swords and his attacks are skilful. By saving energy and emitting it from his sword, Sinbad can perform a charged attack. 
Afshaal's body strength and attack power are the strongest of the four, but he is slow. His rolling tackle is particularly effective.
Prince Rassid has the fastest movement and attack speed of the four. He also has the most health.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 36 years ago:

Arkanoid (c) 1986 Taito Corp.

After a sudden alien assault, the Arkanoid spaceship has been destroyed and the only survivor, the small 'Vaus' space vessel, has been mysteriously trapped in another dimension by an unknown enemy. The player is charged with helping the 'Vaus' overcome the security systems, as well as the many enemies that guard them, before finally finding and destroying 'DOH', the alien responsible for the attack.

Arkanoid is an update of the early ball and paddle video games - and specifically of Atari's 1978 classic, "Super Breakout" - in which the player takes control of a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must use it to deflect a ball into rows of bricks at the top of the screen, thus destroying them and, eventually, clearing the screen to progress to the next level. 

As well as impressive and colourful graphics, Arkanoid introduced a number of new elements to the classic bat 'n' ball gameplay. Certain bricks, when destroyed, would release a power-up - in the form of a falling capsule. the player had to catch the capsule to retrieve the power-up. Among the many enhancements the power-ups provided were an increased 'bat' size, multiple balls, 'sticky' ball (which would stick to the bat and could be released when the player chose) and even a laser, which allowed the player to shoot the bricks.

- TRIVIA -

Arkanoid was released in July 1986 in Japan.

Arkanoid has remained a popular game and is commonly cloned by aspiring game developers in freeware and shareware titles. Many companies have also regularly cloned the game in arcades.

Arkanoid's popularity led to it being featured in "Rainbow Islands - The Story of Bubble Bobble 2", which has a whole level (four stages in all) dedicated to the game, including DOH as the level boss.

Nick Mollison holds the official record for this game on extremely hard settings with 1,156,930 points on September 7, 2008. 
Zack Hample holds the official record for this game on normal settings with 1,658,110 points on March 13, 2000.

An Arkanoid unit appears on the sitcom 'Married... With Children'; Season 6, Episode 4 (Cheese, Cues and Blood).

- UPDATES -

The Japanese version supports cocktail mode whereas the others don't.

- SCORING -

Points are scored for destroying bricks and killings aliens.

Bricks:
White brick: 50 points.
Orange brick: 60 points.
Cyan brick: 70 points.
Green brick: 90 points.
Red brick: 100 points.
Blue brick: 110 points.
Violet brick: 120 points.
Yellow brick: 50 points.
Silver brick: Worth 50X the stage number you are on.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Pill descriptions:
S - Slow: slows down the energy ball.
L - Laser: enables the Vaus to fire laser beams.
C - Catch: catches the energy ball and shoots it when you want it.
B - Break: allow player to move to next playfield.
E - Expand: expands the Vaus.
P - Player: gains an additional Vaus.
D - Disrupt: splits the energy ball into three particles.

* Bricks:
White brick: One shot to destroy.
Orange brick: One shot to destroy.
Cyan brick: One shot to destroy.
Green brick: One shot to destroy.
Red brick: One shot to destroy.
Blue brick: One shot to destroy.
Violet brick: One shot to destroy.
Yellow brick: One shot to destroy.
Silver brick: The number of hits it takes to destroy them increases by one every eight stages.
Gold brick: Cannot be destroyed.

* Power-up Rarity:
The power pills are completely random except that the extra life and warp pills are twice as unlikely to occur. Only one extra life pill is possible per Vaus. If the pill randomizer selects a duplicate pill based on the last pill dropped, a multi-ball pill is substituted. Thus, the multi-ball pill is the only one you can get twice in a row. The randomizer uses player score as the seed, so it is possible to control which pill is dispensed by purposely breaking pill dispensing blocks with specific scores displayed.

* Ball Speed:
On each level, the ball will not speed up completely until it hits the back wall, so:
1) Try to remove bricks from the bottom up, or punch a hole through thicker areas of bricks rather than go straight through (e.g. take out the left side of level 2 rather than the single block at the right as you will catch far more pills).
2) If you have collected a lot of S pills and the ball has been in play for a bit of time, be prepared for a sudden speedup.
3) Also, the D token speeds up the balls and is pretty useless on most levels (the one with the enclosed diamond is the only good example).

* Multiple Balls:
As only one pill can fall at a time, multiple balls can reduce your potential score quite drastically. Every pill is worth 1,000 points. For the first few levels, get every pill you can, but do not use the special powers. You will get a lot of extra ships and should get a gray P or two - thereby starting early with six or seven ships.

* DOH:
In the final level, where you face DOH himself, you should get 15 hits (1,000 points per hit) on DOH/per man until you defeat DOH with the 16th hit on your last man to end the game.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 43 years ago:

Asteroids (c) 1979 Atari, Incorporated.

Asteroids is a legendary, genre defining game - in an era replete with genre-defining classics - in which a single player takes control of a spaceship trapped in the middle of an asteroid belt. A number of large, slow-moving asteroids drift randomly around the play area and must be shot by the player. When shot, the asteroids will break into a number of smaller pieces which must also be shot until eventually, all of the asteroids and fragments will be destroyed and the next wave begins. 

Asteroids introduced real-world physics to video games for the first time, with speed and inertia all adding to the player's problems. As well as the inertia of the player's ship - forcing the player to allow for the ship slowing down and speeding up whenever the Thrust button was utilized - shot asteroids would often send fragments flying in seemingly random directions, and at varying and unpredictable speeds. 

As well as the ever-present asteroids, flying saucers also make a regular appearance. These move horizontally and diagonally around the screen, firing at the player's ship, and must be quickly destroyed. They are destroyed when hit by the player's shot, when hit by a saucer's shot or when they collide with an asteroid. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Spaceship - This is you, the player. You can rotate 360 degrees, fire bullets, thrust forward in any direction, and hyperspace to safety if you feel you are in danger. 

Large Asteroid - These are the large rocks that fill the screen at the beginning of each stage. Hitting one with a bullet will break it apart into two Medium Asteroids. 

Medium Asteroid - Slightly smaller than Large Asteroids, but faster moving. Shooting one of these will result in two Small Asteroids. 

Small Asteroid - These are the smallest and fastest rocks on the screen. If a bullet hits one of these, it will vaporize. 

Large Saucer - Large flying saucers appear on the screen from time to time, randomly firing shots around the screen. They pose a minor threat. 

Small Saucer - The smaller flying saucers are deadlier than the large variety. They are much more precise with their shots, and are more likely to kill you. Eliminate them quickly or get out of their range.

The Asteroids upright cabinet was identical in construction to the "Lunar Lander" cabinet. It was a black upright with sideart that featured a scene of a starship in a blue field of asteroids (with several red explosions thrown in for good measure). The marquee featured almost identical graphics to the side-art (with the addition of the familiar yellow 'Asteroids' logo). The control panel was a busy looking red, white, and blue affair that had no joysticks (only buttons). While the monitor bezel had kind of a nebula scene printed on it (this did not really seem to match the rest of the machine). 

Two different sets of coin doors were made on this title, with early cabinets having a unique design that was soon abandoned in favor of the same one that Atari had been using on Lunar Lander.

- TRIVIA -

Asteroids was released on November 17, 1979 in the USA.

Asteroids was a much celebrated arcade game that captured the imaginations of millions of players, while capturing a good many quarters as well. 

Originally called 'Cosmos', Asteroids' original design brief was a simple copy of Cinematronics' "Space Wars"; with asteroids littering the play-field purely for visual effect. 'Cosmos' was also once known as 'Planet Grab', in which the player had to claim a planet by touching it with their spaceship. 'Cosmos' allowed players to blow up the planets and duel with another ship, Space Wars-style. Only in Asteroids, which arrived two years later, did Atari engineer Lyle Rains, introduce the concept of free-floating rocks. 

On June 17, 1980, Atari's Asteroids and Lunar Lander were the first two video games to ever be registered in the Copyright Office. 

The first 200 Asteroids machines were actually Lunar Lander cabinets; Asteroids was so successful that Atari cut Lunar Lander's production run and released the 200 aforementioned machines, complete with their original Lunar Lander cabinet art. 

Asteroids remains Atari's bestselling arcade game of all time, with approximately 56,565 units produced (47,840 upright and 8,725 cocktail) in total. 

* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters: Working on Asteroids was so intense that Lyle Rains and Ed Logg often dreamt about their work. 

Lyle Rains: 'In the course of my work I have always found that there are times during the development process when the project gets to me in such a way that I'm eating, drinking, sleeping, and breathing the project. When I close my eyes the images of the screen are there and I dream about them at night. There is something just very intense when you live with a project like that day and night, for months at a time. When we were working on Asteroids, I would play Asteroids for a number of hours in the evening, then I'd go home and I'd close my eyes, and as I was drifting off to sleep I'd see the asteroids floating around the screen.'. 

Ed Logg: 'I was shooting the asteroids all night long; I'd just play the game over and over and over in my head, just as if you were playing it in real life. To a certain extent, I play a lot of the games in my mind long before I ever write them because you have to get all the interactions down pat before you can start programming. I know what it's going to look like before I even get there.'. 

* Popular from the Start: a good barometer of a game's future success was how popular it was within the labs at Atari. The software developers often had to chase people away from their Prototype machines when they arrived at their desks in the morning or returned from lunch. 

Lyle Rains: 'The development on the really good games gets bogged down, because people want to play them all the time. I was in the lab quite often playing Asteroids, as were many other people.'. 

On the overall popularity of Asteroids, Steve Calfee said: 'A lot of people really liked it. Somehow, there's something about people, they like to clean spaces. With Asteroids it's easy to measure your accomplishment, you're breaking big rocks into little rocks and then the little rocks into nothing. It's sort of a metaphor for life.'. 

Rich Adam recalled his own first encounter with Asteroids: 'I'll never forget going into the lab and seeing that game for the first time. It was like an adrenaline rush. I'm out flying this spaceship and it's the miraculous escape. I've got this situation where I've got tons of these boulders flying around the screen, I have almost nowhere to go. I get to blast my way out of it and cheat death one more time; that's a good fantasy, you've got all these things flying around and yet you're able to survive.' 

Howard Delman described what it was like creating the sounds for Asteroids: 'In those days there were no all-purpose sound chips like we have now, so I had to create a hardware circuit for each sound. I would string together electrical circuits that would produce an output wave-form that corresponded to the wave-form of the sound. When put through an amplifier and a loud-speaker, it would sound like whatever I was trying to create. The boom-boom-boom background sound was sort of meant to be like a heartbeat, and the idea was that as the game progressed, the sound speeded up, and the player's heart would speed up, too. You know, stress!'. 

* The Great 25-Cent Escape: On the intensity of playing Asteroids, Ed Rotberg recalled: 'Asteroids was just so intense in the fact that you had a concept of all around fantasy. You had to keep your eyes constantly in motion around the screen because the danger could be coming from any direction, at anytime, and it was always so imminent. In Asteroids it was just you out there, trying to survive. It's an incredibly intense game. The tuning in terms of how fast the spaceship turns and how fast the bullets move and how far they go and how fast the asteroids can go, just all the tuning that Ed Logg put into that, is real artistry.'. 

Asteroids is considered, artistically, to be a video-game masterpiece. Ed Logg opines: 'The simple fact that the spaceship in Asteroids continues to move after you cut thrust, providing a wee glimpse of the Newtonian mechanics of actual space flight, triggered the imaginations of many users'. 

Rich Adam said: 'Asteroids fulfilled the fantasy of being out in space, with no gravity, and free floating. The spaceship had a very elegant grace. A lot of motion in the game had grace, even the way the boulders floated around.'. 

And the game's epic quality was noted by Ed Rotberg: 'What Asteroids allows players to do is to put themselves in an incredible predicament, and then extricate themselves from it. You feel like a hero coming out of it.'. 

There was a modified version of Asteroids that was given the nick-name "Turtleroids"; this was part of a long series of practical jokes against the vice-president of marketing for Atari who was feeling jaded in his feeling towards a game concept called 'Turtle Races'. One day, Ed switched the PROMs of the golden edition of Asteroids in the lobby of Atari so that the little and big UFOs were replaced by turtles, thus providing them with a constant reminder. Another practical joke involving Asteroids was a slight modification in the prototype of the game, because Owen Rubin (initials ORR on most Atari high score tables) kept filling up the high score tables when the programmers were not around. So, they modified the program to replace Owen's initials with Ed's own to keep him away. 

In a monumental display of overconfidence on the part of the Atari programmers, Asteroids rolls over at only 99,999 points. Several players during days-long marathon games have scored over 100,000,000... 

Asteroids keeps track of up to 255 extra men. If the player has too many, the game may slow down, probably due to the processor having to draw all the extra men on the screen. 

John McAllister holds the official record for this game with 41,838,740 points on April 5, 2010. 

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including ASTEROID. 

Asteroids inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Hyperspace' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. 

An Asteroids unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Terms of Endearment', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet', in the 1984 movie 'The Iceman', in the 1985 movie 'Remo Williams - The Adventure Begins', in the 1985 movie 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure', and in the 1983 movie 'The Adventures of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie - Strange Brew'.

An upright Asteroids unit appears in the 38 Special music video 'Caught Up In You'.

- UPDATES -

Revision 1 has an invulnerability glitch, which allows players to hide the ship in the upper corners of the screen (in the score) and be invulnerable to collisions. 

Revision 1 also has a bug which affects thrusting. If the ship reaches full velocity moving down or left, and continues thrusting while rotating to the opposite direction, the ship will not slow down from the full velocity that has been reached in the original direction. 

Revision 2 says '1979 Atari' at the bottom of the title screen, instead of the 'Asteroids by Atari' that was displayed in Revision 1. Also, the invulnerability glitch of Revision 1 is corrected. 

Revision 4: 
1) allows small saucer to use wrap-around feature, 
2) allows small saucer to fire immediately when entering the playing area, and 
3) prevents the intermittent loss of 3rd initial on 10th highest score.

- SCORING -

Large Asteroids: 20 points. 
Medium Asteroids: 50 points. 
Small Asteroids: 100 points. 
Large Flying Saucer: 200 points. 
Small Flying Saucer: 1,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When you start the game, your spaceship will be in the middle of the screen with four large asteroids heading toward your ship. After all the rocks are destroyed, the next round begins. The number of initial large asteroids depends on the round number: 
Round 1: 4 
Round 2: 6 
Round 3: 8 
Round 4: 10 
Round 5 and up: 11 

Your job is to blast those rocks. However, when you blast them, they break up into two medium rocks. Blasting a medium rock gives you two small rocks. Note: There is an exception to this rule. The game program only allows 26 asteroids on the screen at any one time. If the screen already contains 26 asteroids of any size, then when you shoot a large asteroid it breaks up into only one medium asteroid, and when you shoot a medium asteroid it breaks up into only one small asteroid. You can completely destroy a large asteroid with only three shots instead of seven when the screen is filled up like this. 

Destroy the fastest-moving asteroids first. The slower asteroids are easier to avoid and you can deal with them later.

In addition, you have to contend with large and small flying saucers. Remember that you get most of your points by shooting these. On the first few screens, you can sit in the middle and blast rocks to your hearts content. There isn't that much danger since the large saucer doesn't track and only fires random shots. Keep in mind of a few things when shooting: 
1) You can have four shots on the screen at any one time. This is useful for when you are blasting rocks at close range. You can pretty much drill them to dust. 
2) Your shots 'wrap around' the screen. This means any shot that goes past the edge of the screen will reappear on the opposite side traveling the same direction. The saucers also have 'wrap around' shots. 

* Try to keep a few defensive shots in reserve. Sometimes, it isn't wise to fire all four shots at once. Without a shot or two in reserve, you are vulnerable if you need to protect yourself from an unexpected asteroid or flying saucer.

* After 10,000 points, the small saucer becomes a permanent part of the game. You can no longer sit in one place since the small saucer is able to track your ship and take you out with the first or second shot. 

* Use hyperspace only in very desperate situations. Something like having four asteroids coming at you at once with nowhere to escape would be a good reason. Eight times out of ten, hyperspace will either put your ship in danger (from a saucer, a plummeting asteroid, or saucer fire) or when you appear somewhere else, your ship will blow up. 

* Although there is danger from the rocks and saucers, you can also be a danger to yourself. Use the thrust carefully or you will find yourself careening out of control on the screen. Some players get really good, however, moving around and shooting. 

* For those desired high scores, you can use the hunting trick. It goes something like this: 
1) After 10,000 points, the small saucers appear. They are worth 1,000 points apiece. First, blast every rock until you have one small rock left. 
2) Go sit in the upper left or right corner of the game screen. 
3) If the small saucer appears from the side you are on, you can blast it before it gets off a shot. If it appears on the opposite side, use the shot 'wrap around' to take care of it. Some people have done this for hours on end and racked up scores in the millions. Of course, it takes a long time at 1,000 points a pop. 
4) Also keep in mind that the small saucer can wrap shots so you may have to move out of danger.

Astro Blaster (c) 1981 Sega.

Astro Blaster is a 1- or 2-player game in which players must advance through squadrons of alien ships in an attempt to dock with the mother ship. Players move their ship left or right and shoot at attacking squadrons. A special time warp allows the player to slow down the alien space ships and their laser fire, while maintaining his own ship and laser fire at normal speed.

As players go through the game play, each step is directed by the voice of mission control. Mission control keeps players informed of fuel status, provides a countdown on warp, keeps track of the number of ships remaining, and monitors the player's laser temperature.

As players enter each new sector they encounter a different number of alien squadrons. Players must destroy all ships in each squadron to pass through the sector. One squadron of rockets is extremely difficult to destroy, but players can pass through this squadron by hitting a few enemy ships. Once a player has destroyed all the squadrons in that sector, he enters an asteroid belt. He must maneuver and shoot his way through the asteroids to reach the mother ship. If fuel is critically low when the player enters the asteroid belt, he can receive extra fuel by shooting the red fireballs interspersed among the asteroids. After passing through the asteroid belt, the player's ship docks with the mother ship and refuels.

There are 29 different alien squadrons players encounter as they move through the different sectors. Every new sector increases in difficulty with different numbers of squadrons in each sector. Each alien ship has its own individualized sounds, movements and firing capability.

During their game, players must keep track of fuel consumption. As the player's ship moves through the sector, it consumes fuel. The player must ensure he has enough fuel to advance through the sector and dock with the mother ship. Extra fuel can only be obtained by shooting red fireballs or docking with the mother ship. The screen also displays the laser temperature. As players fire, the laser temperature rises. When they cease firing it cools down. If the laser overheats, players lose their laser fire until it cools down.

By depressing the warp button, players slow down the enemy ships and their laser fire while maintaining his own at normal speed. Players receive one warp per ships and are awarded one warp upon docking, if he has used his warp in the previous sector.

Each alien ship destroyed carries a different point value. Players also receive double points for destroying an alien ship when their fuel is in the red. To add further excitement, there are 25 tasks that a player performs during the course of the game and receives a secret bonus. Players do not know what these tasks are, but a good player will keep track. The 25 tasks are consistent throughout the game. Players also receive a bonus for any fuel they have left when they dock with the mother ship.

With a two-player game, players alternate at the conclusion of each sector, not after each ship.  Players receive 3 to 5 ships, which is operator adjustable. The game is over when a player runs out of fuel, loses all his ships, or crashes while attempting to dock with the mother ship. The top three scores are displayed and the game ranks players from 1 to 99.

PLAY INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Shoot enemy space ships for points.
2. Shoot fire balls for extra fuel.
3. Use warp to slow down enemy ships and bombs (only once per sector or ship).
4. Discover how to earn secret bonuses for extra points.
5. Dock with mother ship to refuel after each sector.
6. Game over when you run out of ships or fuel.
7. Laser will not fire while overheated.

- TRIVIA -

Astro Blaster was released in March 1981.

Astro Blaster was one of the big contributions from Sega/Gremlin. Utilizing speech synthesis, the game attracted players by stating 'Fighter pilots needed in sector wars, play Astro Blaster'. During game play, the game gave you different advice such as 'Alert, alert, invaders in sector 1, player 1 to battle stations', 'Fuel status marginal', or 'Warp activated, 10, 9, 8,...' to name a few.

Astro Blaster wasn't the first game to introduce speech synthesis in a game, that honor goes to Taito's "Stratovox". Astro Blaster, though, challenged the player to go through seven sectors with a varying amount of waves within each sector. Astro Blaster was an extremely challenging game, it developed a solid following. It wasn't as popular as "Frogger", which was released later on, but it still had a solid showing and redefined how space shooters could be made more challenging. Other notable games released in this year were "Donkey Kong", "Galaga", "Vanguard", and "Wizard of Wor".

The bonuses in this game were actually bugs that would appear if certain events took place. Rather than 'fix' the bugs, Gary Shannon changed them to bonus 'features'.

Gus Pappas holds the official record for this game with 299,100 points on November 20, 1982.

In Sega's Dreamcast 1999 video game "Shenmue", an Astro Blaster cabinet can be seen in the YOU Arcade in Dobuita, but it has an 'out of order' label on it and is not playable. Its possible it was originally playable and had to be removed for some reason, but it is perhaps there simply for the sake of realism; Shenmue is set in 1986/87, so even then it would be considered an old game.

- UPDATES -

Three versions of Astro Blaster were released. The first version was deemed too difficult to play. Version 2 was released to remedy this situation and to be a little more descriptive in the games instructions. Version 3 was basically the EASY version of Astro Blaster. All 3 versions had some things in common:
1) All the different alien spacecraft were in all of the versions, it was just their order of appearance that made a difference.
2) The secret bonuses were common to all three versions. Just because a sector had different waves didn't mean the bonuses for specific events were changed.
3) Each had a high score table that held the 99 top scores.

It was easy to spot a version one machine. The instructions were displayed on the screen. When you inserted your money, you just had to press the 1- or 2-player button to start the game.

On versions 2 and 3, after you inserted your money, a blue screen came up and basically told you to press the 1- or 2-player button.. It also explained some of the rules while in attract mode. The order of the alien attackers is what determined version two and three.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your star ship will be in the middle of the screen. The computer voice will state 'Alert, alert, invaders sector 1, player 1, battle stations'. With that, you are ready to rock and roll. Before you start your game, be sure of what version machine you are playing so you can get yourself prepared. Since each version alters the order of the aliens, it's not good to be prepared for one attack and a totally different attack comes along.

* Although the computer voice can be annoying at times, it also gives you very valuable information. This will actually help you to concentrate more on destroying aliens then constantly looking at your gauges. Some helpful things the voice will tell you are:
1) When your fuel status hits marginal and critical.
2) When your laser temperature is approaching critical.
3) The countdown after you activate warp.

* Fuel is a very precious commodity in this game. If you run out of fuel, your game is over regardless of how many star ships you have left. Learn how to maximize your fuel usage because in the later sectors that have a lot of waves, you will be running on empty. Some other fuel facts:
1) When you activate warp, only the enemies on the screen slow down. Your fuel supply continues to burn away in REAL time.
2) When fuel status marginal is announced, you have approximately 25 seconds of fuel remaining.
3) When fuel status critical is announced, you have approximately 8 seconds of fuel remaining.
4) Shooting the fireballs in the asteroid wave will get you 3 more seconds of fuel.
5) You score double points during fuel status critical.
6) At the end of each sector, you will be re-fueled when you dock with the mothership.
7) Losing a star ship doesn't replenish your fuel supply.

* The warp button can be a blessing or a curse depending on how you use it. You only get one warp per sector or one per star ship. This works fine on the lower sectors that only have a few waves. On the higher sectors, though, you must plan (if possible) the best place to utilize it. Some tips:
1) If it is used on an enemy that goes across the screen, wait until they are halfway across before activating the warp. This way, you can get them all before your warp time runs out.
2) If used on the diagonal flying aliens, again, wait until a lot of them are out before activating.
3) For other aliens, make sure they are mostly on the screen. Sometimes, these aliens disappear off screen and if you activated your warp too early, it will be wasted while they hang around outside of the playing area.

* There are no safe places in this game so you must always be on the look out for not only the aliens dropping on you, but also their laser fire.

* Speaking of laser fire, your ship is equipped with a powerful laser cannon.  There is no limit to the amount of shots you can fire, but there is a catch.  The cannon heats up with each shot fired. It will overheat if you fire too many shots too quickly, and you will have to wait about eight seconds for it to cool off before you can fire it again. Some ways to prevent overheating:
1) Make your shots count. Don't hold down the fire button to take out the aliens. Shoot to kill, not to warn.
2) If you must do multiple shots, do it in short bursts. Your laser heats up much faster then it cools down.
3) If you do overheat, just avoid the aliens and their fire until your laser is operational again.

* Docking is the easiest way to get a lot of points. You need to set yourself up after the last of the asteroids in order to get those points. Moving your ship during docking procedures will prevent you from getting any docking bonus. The most points are from the 'Paint Scraper' method: Line up your left engine over the C in SECTOR. It will look like you will collide with the left docking arm but you will barely squeeze by. Thus, you now have 1,500 points.

* Also, if you destroy your star ship during docking, your game will be over regardless of the number of men you have left.

* Always expect the unexpected in this game. Sometimes the aliens will do things or make moves you haven't seen before. The best way to counter this is to always be on guard.

* After sector seven, the sectors repeat again. Also, the score 'rolls over' at 99,990. Many players will intentionally get themselves killed when they get close to this score in order to claim the number one position on the board.

Astro Fighter (c) 1979 Data East Corporation.

Astro Fighter is a 2-D, space shooter style game. Your job is to protect the various sectors from the hoards of invading aliens. You will have to defeat four waves of alien spaceships in order to dock with the 'GS' ship and refuel. In addition to battling the alien spaceships, you will also have to dodge bombs that seem to come out of nowhere. Armed only with your fighter and a lot of spirit, you must ensure that you clear the screen of invaders before they pass you by. All in all, another walk in the park.

- TRIVIA -

Astro Fighter was released in October 1979. This is the first game manufactured by Data East.

Astro Fighter came as a result of a merging of ideas between Sega and Data East. Unfortunately, this game wasn't well received and didn't sell many units. Sega would improve on the overall design and release "Astro Blaster", which was a superior game in every way to this one. Astro Fighter, though, was still a challenging game and a definite departure from the standard 'shoot'em up' type of space games, it just never caught on.

David Nelson of Derry, New Hampshire, holds the official record for this game with 37150 points on May 31, 2008.

An Astro Fighter unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Rocky III'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle at the bottom of the screen. The alien spaceships have two ways they shoot at your fighter. They either shoot straight down or they shoot diagonally. You must take out all the alien spaceships on a screen. If you fail to do so, you will have to deal with their full complement again and your fighter will be set at the next higher level. If you happen to get killed during a wave, you only have to deal with the remaining alien spaceships.

* Fuel is a precious commodity in this game. You may be able to let one or two waves of aliens escape but you will really be pressed to finish the entire round with enough fuel. If your fuel runs out, your game is over regardless of how many fighters you have left.

* You can only have one shot on the screen at a time. This means you will need to plan your shots and don't fire unless you need to.

* The first four waves of alien spaceships, come down in distinct formations. Understanding how these formations are set up is the key to taking them out quickly.
1) The Blue Aliens come down in a 'pyramid-type' formation. Starting from the bottom, the numbers are five at the bottom, three at the next level, two at the next level, and one at the top.
2) The Purple Aliens come down in two straight lines. With six in the bottom line and six in the top line.
3) The Green Aliens come down in a haphazard-type formation. They move back and forth across the screen and they are the hardest spaceships to deal with.
4) The Yellow Aliens come down in three rows with five spaceships per row.

* As you shoot the alien formations, you will notice that the remaining alien spaceships will speed up. The key is to shoot them high up on the screen so that you are not desperately trying to take out the last ones at the bottom. This also means taking out the bottom attackers first to give yourself some 'breathing' room.

* In addition to the alien spaceships, you must be wary of the bombs that drop down. When you are lining up your shots at the alien spaceships, always be aware of where the bombs may be heading and act accordingly.

* On the fifth wave, you will have to deal with the 'GS' mother ship. Its shots are pretty easy to avoid and it must be hit dead center to stop it, collect the points, and refuel your fighter for the next round.

* There is a 10k bonus trick.  Normally, if you hit the GS mother ship with your first shot you get 950 points, otherwise you get 300 points. However, if you miss with your first shot and then destroy it with your 55th shot (counting from the beginning of the level, or when you start with a new ship) you get 10,000 points!  There are 4 waves per level - 11 enemies on the 1st, 12 on the 2nd and 3rd, and 15 on the 4th (50 total), so you can miss 3 times (or hit bombs) before you reach the mother ship.

Bagman (c) 1982 Valadon Automation [VA].

The objective of the game is to maneuver Bagman through various mine shafts, picking up money bags and placing them in a wheelbarrow at the surface of the mine. The player must avoid pursuing guards, moving ore carts, and descending elevators. The player may temporarily stun the guards by striking them with a pickaxe or by dropping money bags on them when they are below the player on the same ladder. The player may move between the three screens which make up the level via shafts and on the surface.

Bagman is played using one 4-way joystick and one action button. The joystick is also used to jump out of the ore cart. The Action Button is used to make the Bagman perform the following tasks:
Pick up and drop money bags
Pick up and drop pickaxe
Grab and release the ceiling beam to avoid the ore cart (this can be done while carrying a money bag)
Placing a money bag in the wheelbarrow
Pick up and drop the wheelbarrow

Points are scored for each horizontal step the player takes, for each money bag placed in the wheelbarrow, and for each guard stunned.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 29 years ago:

Batsugun (c) 1993 Toaplan.

A vertically scrolling shoot'em up game. As is the standard with most arcade shooters, the player controls their ship with a joystick and two buttons. One button (Fire) shoots the main guns, and the other button (Bomb) releases a smart bomb that spreads huge energy balls all around the player's ship.

As enemies are destroyed, the player gains experience points that are separate from the score. For every 288 experience points gained, the main gun will 'level up', becoming much stronger. This is analogous to experience points and leveling up in role playing games. The weapon can only level up twice, so after it has achieved its maximum level, 288 experience points will grant the player an extra bomb.

The player can also grab P icons to increase the power of the current level gun. A maximum of five "P"s can be collected per experience level; getting more after this gives extra points instead.

Collecting B icons increases the number of bombs, to a maximum of 7.

Apart from destroying enemies, points can be gained from collecting golden V-shaped medals. After the level is finished, 3000 points are awarded for every small one, and 5000 points for every large one. If the player's ship is destroyed during a level, all medals collected are lost.

- TRIVIA -

Batsugun was released in February 1993.

BATSUGUN means 'Preeminence', 'Predominace' or 'By far the best'.
BATSU means 'Dominant', 'Outstanding' or 'Excel'.
GUN is originally 'Group' or 'Brigade', but also means 'Common Level'.
BATSU also means a cross (X) mark, so there's an X under the logo of Batsugun.

Licensed to Taito for world distribution and to Unite Trading for Korea.

This is the last shoot'em up and the first 'non-endless' game by Toaplan. A special version of Batsugun existed, originally it was only for the AOU show (Arcade Operators Union, an arcade game show held in Japan every year) and not for sale. After the Toaplan bankruptcy, the board started to appear on the second hand market.

Heralded by some as the first 'maniac shooter', Batsugun involved employees who would go on to form and work at Cave and continue to work in this subgenre. Batsugun saw an evolution in the use of complex bullet and enemy patterns and player fire power and hit-box.

The scoring trick on the fourth boss (destroy the two giant laser cannons, let the tanks appearing from the hangars fill the ramps and become red, bomb for 59,630 points a tank) was one source of inspiration for "Battle Garegga"'s gameplay.

Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Batsugun - PCCB-00151) on 18/03/1994.

- TRIVIA -

Battle Garegga was released in February 1996. It was considered as the first 'Danmaku' shooting game. Danmaku is a Japanese term for 'barrage', as in a barrage of bullets.

The main source of inspiration for this game has been the game "Gun Frontier" (1990 ,Taito). The main gun and bomb power-up systems are almost identical in mechanics, many vehicles have the same attacking patterns, you can destroy scenery and there are flamingos flying away at stage 2 of both games:). Another interesting thing: "Batsugun" also was a source of inspiration for this game, as the last Toaplan game was one of the first SHMUPS in which bombing in key spots (4th boss) could grant a lot of points.

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'H!?'.

Shinseisha released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Battle Garegga - GV-027(4-88199-284-8)) on 30/09/1996.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Battle Garegga weapons:
1) Shot: to powerup your Shot, pick up small or big Shot powerups. The small powerups need to be collected in quantities: (1st) default &gt; (2nd) 1 item &gt; (3rd) 2 items &gt; (4th) 4 items &gt; (5th) 8 items

2) Special weapon: to get one full Weapon in stock, you must collect 40 SMALL Weapon bullets (or one BIG bullet), and you can hold a maximum of four full Weapons and 40 SMALL Weapon bullets. Whenever you die, you get a bonus of 20 SMALL Weapon bullets added to your current stock.

3) Options: there are five basic formations available which are controlled by pressing the "Change Formation" button. They are:
- Spread: two on each side of your ship, one fixed by your side firing at a wideish angle, and one fixed near your ship's nose, firing at a tighter angle. Overall firepower style similar to a fiveway spread.
- Tail: 4 pointing backwards in a wide fan shape, similar to a Silvergun's fully powered Tail shot.
- Front: 4 pointing straight forwards, fixed in front of your ship's nose. Good for concentrated attacks.
- Rotate: 4 Options spaced equally in a ring around your ship, spinning and firing when you do. Pretty useless.
- Trace: similar formation to Front, except they follow your ship around the screen, firing in the opposite direction to your movements. More useful than Rotate Wink
The order in which the Option formations are cycled are as follows. It is important to learn this order, as quick switching of formations is important to survival in many stages:
Spread &gt; Tail &gt; Front &gt; Rotate &gt; Trace &gt; (back to Spread)
There are also secret formations, that are activated when you fulfill certain requirements. These requirements are based on missing a certain number and type of item BEFORE you pick up the next available Option icon, and also remember that it is a lot easier to set up for certain special formations than others:
- Search: these are fixed in a similar formation to Spread, but they track and fire at nearby enemies. It is quite hard to destroy faster moving drones with this formation, so if possible, avoid this and go for Homing instead. To get Search, miss 5 Option items, then pick up the next one that appears.
- Shadow: the Option items trail your ship much like the Gradius Options do. Useful if you like that sort of thing Wink. To get Shadow, miss 5 Medals, then pick up an Option item.
- Homing: the Options have full range of the screen, and will fly right up to the nearest enemy and attack. Very useful Very Happy. To get Homing, miss 5 SMALL Weapon bullets, then pick up an Option item.
- Wide: they are fixed in the same manner as the Spread formation, but have a much wider firing angle. To get Wide, miss 5 SMALL Shot power ups, then pick up an Option item.
- Chain: only available in two-player mode, the Options will create a chain between both ships. More Options beans a bigger chain Very Happy. To get Shadow, one player must satisfy a special formation condition, and the chances of Chain activating is 50%..
There is also a activation order for the special formations which takes effect if you satisfy two or more activation conditions. The order is:
Search &gt; Shadow &gt; Homing &gt; Wide
You can also cancel a special formation by a press of the Option button. Canceling a special form puts you straight back into Spread options.

* Self Destruction: one other unlisted weapon you can use is the explosion and resulting scattered shrapnel released from your ship when it is destroyed. The power of the explosion itself isn't very powerful, but the shrapnel can cause moderate damage to larger enemies. For example, the four large tanks before the Stage 4 boss can have their turrets and tracks destroyed with a well placed suicide, which can set up for easier collection of the LARGE Weapon bullets they hold. The shrapnel released from your ship's explosion also nullifies bullets, so if you find yourself in a tricky situation with a few extra lives in stock, suicide one of them.

* Ship Selection: at the ship select screen...
1) To select a 'Normal power type' fighter, select your ship with A button
2) To select a 'Speed Up power type', select your ship with B button
3) To select a 'Shot power type', select your ship with C button
4) To select a 'Speed up &amp; Shot power type', select your ship with A+B+C button.

* "Mahou Daisakusen" Character: insert a credit, at the title screen press Up(x2), Down(x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, A, B, C, Start.

* Extended Mode: insert a credit, press and hold A and press Start (This code does not work with the type-2 version).

* Harder Mode: insert a credit, press and hold B and press Start (This code does not work with the type-2 version).

* Stage Edit: insert a credit, press and hold C and press Start (This code does not work with the type-2 version).

* Unlock Special mode (combines extended, stage edit and harder modes): insert a credit, press and hold A+B+C and press Start (this code does not work with the type-2 version).

* Hint: destroy bridges and buildings!! Use your smartbombs to destroy bridges and buildings. They often contain large numbers of score medals.

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 31 years ago:

Raguy (c) 1991 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.

Raguy is an environmentally-themed scrolling platform game for one or two players in which the peaceful home planet of Raguy has been invaded by the evil Daruma tribe. The Daruma are polluting the planet as they consume its dwindling resources and time is running out. 

Taking on the role of a heroic young man called 'Blue' (with the second player playing 'Princess Fa' in the two-player game), players must fight through fourteen stages, split over four different worlds, to defeat the Daruma and save the planet's eco system. 

Both Blue and Princess Fa have the ability to stun enemies by hitting them with a large leaf that serves as their default weapon. Once stunned, enemies can be picked up and thrown as projectiles at other enemies. Blue and Princess Fa can also shrink in size in order to access hidden areas, but they are not able to stun enemies while in shrunken form. If only one player is shrunk, they can be picked up by the other player and thrown as a projectile at enemies. Blue and the Princess can also jump on enemies' heads and propel them at other enemies, but if the enemy ricochets and hits the player, the player takes damage.

As well as the default leaf weapon, other weapons in the form of either boomerangs or bombs can be picked up and all weapons can be powered-up three times. Other items that can aid the players' quest include a plant stem that increases player Speed and additional hearts that increase player health.

Flowers are scattered throughout the stages and these are the game's currency to be used in the shops that occasionally appear. There are two different types of shop, offering either tips and advice for overcoming certain obstacles, or health, attribute and weapon power-ups.

At the end of each world players must battle a large boss character. Once the boss has been defeated, the game offers a branching path with players able to choose their next route.

Blazing Star (c) 1998 Yumekobo.

Blazing Star is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the planets of Remuria and Mutras are engaged in endless interplanetary war. This fuels the development of ever-more dangerous weapons, eventually leading to the production of fully organic weapons that combine both human and alien technology. Soon, a fully sentient weapon called 'Brawshella' is born. Brawshella gathers all animal life on Remuria and Mutras and bends them to its will, forcing them to attack and assimilate the human race. 

Within days of Brawshella's appearance all humans are assimilated and now have no other purpose than to continue fighting each other. Over time, six of the assimilated fighter pilots regain their consciousness and remember their pasts. Upon rediscovering their humanity, they turn against the machines, in a battle to save humanity.

Blazing Star is controlled via joystick and two buttons. Button 'A' fires the normal shot, if this is tapped rapidly, however, a variation on the normal shot is used. If the A button is held down, the ship stores energy for a charged shot, which is fired when the button is released. The charged-shot attacks have a duration based on how long the button is held for. Pressing the B button during the attack will split the projectile, greatly increasing its range.

Players can choose to pilot one of six different ships, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The 'Hellhound' is the perfect ship for performing high-scoring combos, for example. The 'Windina' has a wide and powerful shot; both 'Dinos' - the Pulstar hunters - are excellent in defense and pack efficient weapons. Finally, Aryutalism and Peplos require a little more skill and are best suited to experienced players. 

Power-ups can increase the strength of the player's guns, while also increasing the maximum power of the charged shot. The types of shots, charge-up attacks, and split shots used are dependent on which ship the player selects.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 35 years ago:

Black Tiger (c) 1987 Capcom.

Export release. Game developed in Japan. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese release entry; "Black Dragon".

- TRIVIA -

Black Tiger was released in August 1987 outside Japan. It is known in Japan as "Black Dragon".

Although they are similar in nature, there are also significant differences between the export version, Black Tiger, and the original version, Black Dragon. Globally, the export version is an easier game. Below are some of the more apparent differences found in these Export versions: 
* Items less expensive.
* Less pitfalls (rocks).
* Less and easiest enemies.
* Bosses easiest.
* Points given by the Red Dragon, Red Demon Warrior, and Black Dragon are differents (see scoring section).
* The bonuses are changed (different value and position).
* The secret item locations are the same but the symbols for them are different.

A bootleg of this game was released by Dragon with the same name. 

Isiah Johnson holds the official record for this game with 2344150 points on May 31, 2008.

- SCORING -

Scoring is exactly the same as in the original Japanese version except for the following bosses: 
Dragon (red): 10,000 points 
Demon Warrior (red): 150,000 points 
Dragon (black): 10,000 points.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 32 years ago:

Blood Bros. (c) 1990 TAD.

Blood Bros is an into-the-screen shooter with the action viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The brothers can move left and right to avoid incoming fire while the enemies themselves are targeted by moving an on-screen cross-hair over them and pressing fire. If the fire button is held down, the player-character remains static, allowing for more accurate targeting of the cross-hair. While static, the brothers are more vulnerable to incoming enemy fire.

Players have limitless ammunition for their primary gun, and carry a limited number of sticks of dynamite. Dynamite is used in a similar fashion to grenades; it can be thrown at enemies and inflicts greater damage than guns. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed. Each of the game's stages is littered with structures that can also be destroyed. This removes enemy cover as well as earning players bonus points. 

Power-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed on-screen or dropped by shooting the special characters that occasionally appear, such as the small Indian Chief or warthogs. Points and weaponry can also be dispensed from the tin can, if you shoot it into the air and juggle it with subsequent shots. Some power-ups give special weapons with increased firepower, others grant extra dynamite or points.

- TRIVIA -

Even if titlescreen says 1990, Blood Bros. was released in January 1991 in Japan.

According to dead code buried in Sky Smasher, it appears that the working title for Blood Bros. was 'Cabal II In West'.

A pirate version of the game is known as "West Story".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Here's A Way To Play Blood Bros. For As Long As You Want:
1) Get to the second screen (preferably without dying on the first screen).
2) Shoot the building on the right side of the screen and start shooting the trees in the background on the right. 20,000 points fly out from each bunch of trees. Continue.
3) That is basically it. A few problems occur and here is how to counter them:
3a) 5 men run across the back from the left and throw grenades: Just shoot the grenades before they get to you. Eventually they come out less often, and will stop altogether.
3b) The men on the right come out from the edge to shoot you: Same as above. They stop eventually.
3c) A plane flies over and drops bombs: Same as above. It stops after some time.
3d) After a certain amount of time a bird comes out to kill you: Let it. Only 2 birds ever come out (sometimes only 1) and then they also stop coming. This is why it pays not to die on the first screen.
4) Hold your finger on the button to keep shooting the trees (sticky-tape works well here) and prepare to get 'really' bored. Play the neighboring game so that you can keep an eye on it.

* Extra Live: On the 1-1 and 4-1 stages, the tin can be shot eight times to give you a free man. If you miss it, don't bother trying again - you only get one chance.

		<name>Bomb Jack</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 38 years ago:

Bomb Jack (c) 1984 Tehkan.

Bomb Jack is a fast-moving platform game in which the aim is to collect all of the bombs on each level before progressing to the next. A variety of constantly spawning mechanical enemies patrol the platforms and airspace so the longer a player takes to collect all of the bombs, the more difficult progress becomes. 

Extra point bonuses are awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Only one bomb at any time has a lit fuse, and collecting twenty or more of these lit bombs on any given level will earn the player points bonus (see TIPS AND TRICKS for details). Jack is pursued around each level by the spawning enemies and when he gets killed, he drops down to the nearest platform, always landing on his head. 

A 'Powerball' appears at semi-regular intervals and moves diagonally around the screen. If the player manages to grab this, all of the level's monsters are frozen for several seconds and can then be killed by having Jack fly into them (similar to the 'Powerpill' feature in "Pac-Man"). Collecting the Bonus 'B' symbols will increase the amount of points awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Picking up an 'Extra' symbol awards the player with an additional life, while catching the 'Special' symbol will give the player an extra credit. 

Each of Bomb Jack's levels feature one of five different background pictures, some of which represent famous historical landmarks. They are: the Sphinx in Egypt, the Acropolis in Greece, Castle Neuschwanstein in Bavaria, skyscrapers and a cityscape by night. While the backgrounds themselves are repeated as the game progresses, the platform layouts for each level are completely different. At least until level 18, after which the levels are repeated. 

The basic play mechanic of collecting objects to clear a level, as well as the powerball feature, is hugely reminiscent of Namco's seminal "Pac-Man".

- TRIVIA -

Bomb Jack was released in March 1984 in Japan and in October 1984 in the USA.

The original idea for Bomb Jack was conceived by Michitaka Tsuruta, lead designer for Guzzler and Solomon's Key, under the supervision of Kazutoshi Ueda, the genius behind Mr. Do, Lady Bug and other Universal coin-ops.

Curiously enough, the infamous Sphinx in the opening round was not rendered by the graphic designer of the game, but by Tsukasa Masuko, the sound designer. Tsuruta-san recalls how roles in Japanese development teams were quite interchangeable, in those early years.

Round 1 music is the ending song from the Japanese animated cartoon series 'Spoon Oba-san', sung by the ultra-popular Mari Ijima (Lynn Minmay's voice in Macross). The anime was aired in 1983... at that time, Bomb Jack development was just starting: something more than a coincidence, then.
Round 2 features the music of 'Lady Madonna', by The Beatles. Tsuruta-san,  recalls that rights were paid for the licensed music at the time; still, later ports (PS2 and Xbox) come with a replaced soundtrack (mostly the Vs. Mighty Bomb Jack score).

"Bomb Jack II" has nothing really to do with Tekhan or Tecmo: it was developed by British Elite Systems for European home computers only, in an attempt to follow the huge success of the Bomb Jack coin-op conversion. They basically bought the license for the name, and then proceeded to create a mediocre maze game.

Giauco Bondavalli holds the official record for this game with 20,010,960 points on November 3, 1984.

Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Tecmo Game Music - 28XA-95) on 25/09/1986.

- UPDATES -

The older version (set 2) says 'YOU ARE LUCY' instead of 'YOU ARE LUCKY'.

- SCORING -

Jumping, hitting a wall or falling from a platform: 10 points x bonus multiplier value.
Normal bomb: 100 points x bonus multiplier value.
Firebomb: 200 points x bonus multiplier value.

(P) Power: 100 when blue, 200 when red, 300 when purple, 500 when green, 800 when cyan, 1,200 when yellow and 2,000 points when grey x bonus multiplier value.

(B) Bonus Multiplier: 1,000 points x bonus multiplier value.
(E) Extra Life: 1,000 points x bonus multiplier value plus an extra life.
(S) Special: 1,000 points x bonus multiplier value plus a free credit.

Killing monsters while (P) is active: 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1,200 and 2,000 points. These are all multiplied by the current bonus multiplier value.

End of level bonus:
23 firebombs defused: 50,000 points.
22 firebombs: 30,000 points.
21 firebombs: 20,000 points.
20 firebombs: 10,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* A little information about the appearance of the powerball: the rule is very simple and you just have to look at the colour at the left and right of the multiplicator number, its size grows as you collect bombs.

1) Take a 'lit bomb' and you get 1 point ahead for the next Powerball. Take a non-lit bomb and you'll get 0.5 point for the next Powerball. When you achieve 10 points, the powerball appears. Your powerball points don't grow if either the powerball is there or if the 'power music' is playing, so avoid collecting bombs when it's not necessary.

2) The powerball can have different score values when taking it. When it appears, jump or hit a wall and its colour will change. The colours and score values are blue (100 points), red (200 points), purple (300 points), green (500 points), turquoize (800 points), yellow (1000 points) and grey (2000 points).

3) The 'B' bonus coin adds 1 to the multiplicator value and appears each 5,000 points, but only if you 'pass' these 5,000 points when not taking a 'B' coin. For example, your multiplicator is 2x, your score is 9,000 and you take a 'B' coin; giving you 1,000x2 = 2,000 points which makes a total of 11,000 points. A 'B' coin should then appear because you have passed the 10,000 points, but doesn't because you took a 'B' coin to achieve this score so you'll have to wait for 15,000 points to get a new 'B' coin. The multiplicator limit is X5.

* An important piece of information to remember is that you can pick up the bombs in a certain order to earn maximum points. If you pick up most of the bombs while their fuses are lit, you get the following bonuses:
20 - 10,000 pts.
21 - 20,000 pts.
22 - 30,000 pts.
23 - 50,000 pts.
So of course, you'll want to try to get 23 each time (This is of course, VERY difficult!). The P (Power) coin appears after every ninth bomb is collected. The points value of the P coin ranges from 100 (Blue) to 2,000 (Silver). Since the color changes each time BJ jumps, you can control the bonus level by making small jumps until the coin turns silver.

* The B (Bonus) coin appears every 5,000 points, and advances the bonus multiplier by 1. There is a maximum of 5 B coins per level.

* Picking up the S (Special) coin awards one free credit. It will also take you to the next level automatically.

* You can control where the mechanical bird appears by holding the joystick in the opposite direction. Example: Hold the joystick to the Right as soon as the round starts and the mechanical bird appears on the left of the screen. If the stick is held diagonally, the bird appears in the opposite corner.

* When you start a level, and directly go to left or right, bird(s) will appear on the other side: it's useful to put them where you want in order to make this level easier, levels 7, 8 &amp; 9 are good examples for that.

- TRIVIA -

Breaker's Revenge was released on July 03, 1998. It runs on the Neo-Geo MVS and was never released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.

A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Unlock Bai-Hu: At the character selection screen, press Up at the same time on both 1P&amp;2P joystick.

Burger Time (c) 1982 Data East.

Stand-alone release of "Hamburger [Model DT-126]". For more information on the game itself, please see the original release entry.

- TECHNICAL -

Main CPU: MOS Technology M6502 (@ 1.5 Mhz)
Sound CPU: MOS Technology M6502 (@ 500 Khz)

- TRIVIA -

Burger Time was released in August 1982 in Japan. 

The game was originally titled "Hamburger" in Japan, but was renamed "Burger Time" before being exported internationally. It was originally made for the DECO Cassette System, an early arcade format that pulled the game data from audio cassettes. The cassette system enjoyed a brief bit of popularity, until it was discovered that the cassettes quickly wore out, rendering the game useless. Bally/Midway licensed this title soon after its original release, and redesigned the hardware to drop the cassette altogether. The Bally/Midway version of the game sold vast quantities when compared to the original.

This stand-alone version, manufactured without Bally/Midway's involvement, features a different attract mode.

When starting a new game (and a new life after getting caught), the game start display says 'Game Ready'. This was corrected to 'Get Ready' in the Bally/Midway version. It originally said 'Game Start' in "Hamburger".

When the chef runs out of pepper, the 'Pepper' display blinks, but there is no warning sound.

In the Data East USA version: 
* Gameplay is noticeably much faster than the other versions.
* 'Lives' dip switch can be set to 30,000, 50,000, 80,000, or None.
* The attract mode is exactly the same as the Bally/Midway version except for the different copyright information on the title screen.

Bryan Wagner holds the official record for this game with 11,512,500 points on September 19, 2008.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Stage 1

The introductory stage is very spacious and balanced, and you will only have to contend with three copies of Mr. Hot Dog and one copy of Mr. Egg. No one section of the stage presents any danger since ample escape routes can be found. At most, the burger layers only need to drop through five floors, so this stage won't take you as long as some of the other stages. Use this stage to understand the nature of the enemies' movement. Note how they tend to alternate between walking across a floor and using a ladder whenever they encounter one or the other that brings them closer to your position. Setting up the layers to allow enemies to drop with them is fairly easy to do.

Stage 2

While this stage features the same number of enemies as the previous stage, the layout of the floors makes the top portion of the screen much safer than the bottom portion. With the limited space and choices in the lower half of the stage, it is best to save it for last when you have no choice but to clear it. Focus on getting to the top as quickly as possible, but watch out for where the enemies are appearing. Staying on a ladder for a little while is a great way to lure enemies to a lower floor than the one you intend to visit. Once the two side burgers are complete, you must venture down the center of the stage. Before you do, draw the enemies as high as possible before heading down the center. Once you're ready to clear the stage, try to lure an enemy on to a top bun before dropping it. If you time it well, the enemies can clear the stage for you faster than you could. Note that the lower floors where the burgers wait are dead ends.

Stage 3

Even though you must build six burgers with only three layers each, this stage is a lot tougher than it looks. This time, six enemies will pursue you, including the never-before-seen Mr. Pickle. First and foremost, you need to get out of the bottom portion of the stage as quickly as possible. And the left is not a good choice for escape routes. If the copy of Mr. Pickle that enters from that side doesn't get you, another enemy is almost sure to come down that left ladder and trap you. Instead, head immediately for the right. If you're an expert player, you may choose to complete that lower right hamburger before continuing on to the top, but the more time you spend there, the bigger opportunity you give the enemies to trap you. Beginners should climb the right side of the stage all the way to the top in order to gain a little control over the enemies' movements. Like the previous stage, focus on completing the burgers at the top before tackling the lower burgers on either side.

Stage 4

You may feel a little daunted by the task at hand when you first see this stage: four hamburgers composed of eight layers. That's a lot of walking. But if you remember to focus your efforts on the top buns as much as possible, you won't waste a lot of time. The ladders are arranged in such a way that continuous climbing is difficult to accomplish. Instead, you and the enemies are more likely to staircase your way through the stage in order to get around. This can be a blessing and a curse. It's good because the enemies have few direct paths or multiple options to attack you from. It's bad because you need to become very skilled at controlling the chef in order not to slow down as you progress up or down the screen. The chef can feel very sluggish on ladders, and it can be difficult at first to properly time his transitions from ladder to floor and back to ladder again. By the time you complete this stage however, you'll have plenty of practice.

Stage 5

If you think that this stage is easier than the last stage because there's only half as many burgers to make, you're wrong. The layout of the stage is such that you have very few options to get from one section to another. Fewer options to move means fewer chances to escape so you must plot your course through this stage very carefully in order to avoid the six enemies that will be occupying the stage with you. There are two strategies to take. One involves luring the enemies to the lower right hand portion of the stage to keep them occupied for a while. This can be risky however, since you might become trapped from above and below. The other strategy is to employ pepper more liberally, provided you have a good supply by this stage. If you intend to use pepper, and wish to make the most use out of it, be sure to freeze enemies while they are standing on top of a layer so that you can walk across the layer and send it falling several stories with the enemy on board.

Stage 6

This is the last new stage that you will see before the game repeats the cycle of stages over again. In the heat of the moment, it's very easy to assume that certain paths on this stage connect when in fact they don't. Total comprehension of your available escape routes will decrease your chances of getting trapped and increase your chances of survival. The burgers on the side are especially dangerous since every layer is perched on a dead end. If an enemy is following you, it's relatively easy to drop a burger layer with the enemy standing on it, but getting out of the area can be tricky if you are too slow and allow another enemy to pursue you. You'll need to employ every trick that you've learned in the previous five stages to make it out of this one. The most important thing is not to panic.

Beyond Stage 28

The game will continue normally until stage 28. Starting on stage 28 the enemies move about 2 1/2 times faster than they did before. After 90 seconds (if you can survive that long on one chef), they slow down to a crawl, moving one step every 5 seconds. You can still die if you run into the enemies. The chef's speed never changes. If you can make it to the top of the board (28), you can find the "safe" spot. You can hide out here until they slow down. You will need new patterns for each board to group the enemies, and wait each time for each drop. It can take 1-1 1/2 hour per board at this level.

Bubble Bobble II (c) 1994 Taito.

European release. Game developed in Japan. See the original for more information; "Bubble Symphony".

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the "Taito F3 System" Hardware.

- TRIVIA -

Released in October 1994 in Europe, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Mainland China, Taiwan and Korea. 

A prototype version is known to exist - it have many differences from the final version; it’s almost an entirely different game, lacking even a title screen at the point in development it comes from. Levels, graphics, enemies, sound and music are different, gameplay is different, stage names are different, stage selection is different, no story sequence, no high score sequence, and no game logo during the attract mode. It is really more of a proof of concept sequel than anything close to a finished game at this point, and that's what makes it fascinating. The build date is close to a year before the final game, a lot changes in one year of development.

Bubble Bobble (c) 1986 Taito Corp.

One or two players take on the role of Bub and Bob, two cute dinosaurs who must battle through 100 platform-packed single screen levels to rescue their girlfriends. Bub and Bob are armed only with the ability to blow bubbles, in which the game's many enemies can be trapped and killed. The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the dinosaurs reach previously inaccessible areas of a level. 

Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points. 

On many levels, bubbles containing fire, water or a lightning bolt appear. These can be burst by players to release their contents and destroy enemies. The fire bubble drops flames down onto the nearest platform, killing any enemies it hits. The lightning bubble sends a lightning bolt horizontally across the screen, its direction dictated by whichever side of the bubble the player hits to burst it. The water bubble releases a torrent of water that will quickly flow down the platforms to the bottom of the screen. Any enemies caught in the flow are killed. 

Bubbles containing letters also appear. The aim is to collect the letters needed to spell the word E.X.T.E.N.D. which earns players an extra life. 

The game's simple-yet-involving game-play saw Bubble Bobble become an instant classic. Its two-player co-operative mode, coupled with the incredible amount of hidden secrets and potential for strategic play - unheard of in the platform genre - would set the standard by which all other platform games were judged.

- TRIVIA -

Bubble Bobble was released in August 1986. 

This was one of the first games to feature multiple endings. 

The title of this game, Bubble Bobble, is a cross between the words 'bubble' and the name of the heroes: Bub and Bob. 

The enemies are named (Round number of initial appearance applies to 'Normal' mode. For information on 'Super' mode, please see the Romstar (US version) entry, Updates section: 
'Zen-Chan' [aka 'Bubble Buster', 'Benzo'] - First appears in Round 1 
'Mighta' [aka 'Stoner', 'Boris'] - First appears in Round 6 
'Monsta' [aka 'Beluga', 'Blubba'] - First appears in Round 10 
'PulPul' [aka 'Hullaballoon', 'Boaboa'] - First appears in Round 20 
'Banebou' [aka 'Coiley', 'Bonnie-bo'] - First appears in Round 30 
'Hidegonsu' [aka 'Incendo'] - First appears in round 40 
'Drunk' [aka 'Willy Whistle', 'Bonner'] - First appears in Round 50 
'Invader' [aka 'Super Socket'] - First appears in Round 60 
'Super Drunk' [aka 'Grumple Gromit'] - the boss character whom Bub and Bob fight in the final round 
'Skel-Monsta' [aka 'Baron Von Blubba'] - Appears when you take too much time in a round 
'Rascal' [aka 'Rubblen'] - Appears when you linger too long in a secret room 

The data code contains unused graphics of a full set of slot machine icons. These aren't used anywhere, there's no palette that fits them, and they wouldn't really fit anywhere either. 

In 1996, Taito announced that they lost the original source code program to Bubble Bobble following a reorganization - when it came to the recent ports and sequels, they had to work from program disassembly, playing the game and (mainly) the various home computer ports. 

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'H.!', but go to the Tips and Tricks section for more information about 'SEX':-) 

Olly Cotton holds the official record for this game with 6,060,730 points on February 23, 2011. 

Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Bobble Bobble" and "Super Bobble Bobble". 

Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Taito Game Music - 28XA-110) on January 25, 1987. 

NES cover band The Advantage cover two songs from Bubble Bobble on their self-titled debut album released on April 6, 2004.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Bubble Bobble is a game heavily relying on game-play and precise technique rather than graphics, and it features a series of special techniques and tricks a player can perform to maximize his or her score, make some rounds of the game easier or faster to finish or just to be able to survive or even finish a round. Some of these techniques have special nicknames, which may differ from player to player and from country to country. 

'Kissing monsters' or just kissing means killing a monster by blowing a bubble at almost contact distance: the monster will be instantly bubbled and the bubble will be instantly popped, giving the visual effect of the player killing a monster with a 'kiss'. Some players flip their joysticks in the opposite direction after pressing the bubble buttons, giving more chances of an 'instant pop' and changing flight direction for the dead monster. This technique is useful in stages where monsters move too fast, bubbles last for too short of a time or it's otherwise hard to bubble them normally. Of course good timing is required for this technique to work. 

'Riding bubbles' means keeping the jump button pressed when dropping on a bubble: if done correctly, instead of popping the bubble, your dragon will instead jump on it, possibly continuously, enabling him to 'ride' bubbles in order to reach otherwise unreachable areas. Some stages can't be finished without this technique. 

'Climbing' is a step up from riding bubbles. It means standing at half a bubble distance from a wall, jumping and blowing a bubble almost simultaneously, jumping up from that bubble and blowing another bubble and so on. This is necessary if the air current pushes down bubbles but you need to climb up. Having the rapid-bubbling power-up (the yellow candy) makes climbing a lot easier, especially if you got the running shoes already. 

'Bubbling oneself through' means 'riding a bubble' through the opening at the top of a stage or even just through the ceiling of a stage in order to appear at the lower part, like some flying monsters can do. This technique is required to finish some stages or to get unstuck from some places, or just to save time. 

'Blowing against the wall' means blowing bubbles against wall at contact distance: the bubbles will pop immediately thus giving the player 10 points per bubble pop. This can be used to either increase a player's score, or to set a player's score to a specific amount, in order to do other tricks. 

'Two equal digits' means using the 'blowing against the wall' technique or other score-adjusting techniques in order to make the two penultimate (100s and 10s places) digits of at least one player equal, e.g., 456770, before the last enemy bubble is burst. If done correctly and the score is not modified when this occurs, then all remaining non-special bubbles on screen will be turned to 700-point bonuses, whose appearance depends on the digit picked. E.g., 7 gives Chocolate Ice Creams, 3 gives Hamburgers, and so on. 
Note: This trick is easier to do with two players (one player adjusts his score and the other bursts the bubbles), but it can also be done with only one player, although calculating exactly how much (and if) one's score will be modified when bursting the last enemy bubbles can be extremely complex, if not unpredictable, especially if there are very large and clustered bubble bunches. 
Note: Rounds with numbers ending with 5 and 0 up to and including level 50 generate bonuses from bubbles automatically, though, and some rounds (including round 1) do it by default. 

Internal Counters: An interesting (and exploitable) part of bubble bobble is that powerups are not entirely random. As with the two-digit trick, many internal counters in this game decide which special powers are available for collection. For example, rapid bubble shooting (a sweet in yellow wrapping), fast moving bubbles (a blue sweet), or fast moving bubbles (a blue sweet) appear shortly after either Bub or Bob jumps 51 times, pops 51 bubbles, or blows 51 bubbles. Also, running around a lot causes the speed powerup (red shoe) to appear. Keeping this is mind, it is possible to gain all power-ups with relative ease. Although there are many more counters that control various aspects of the game, one of particular interest is the letters forming the word EXTEND. Getting all 7 letters will end the current level and award the player with an extra life 'NICE 1P!' - these letters have a greater chance of appearing when more enemies are defeated simultaneously. Also, gathering three of the same letter causes candy canes to appear which in turn lead to a special big item at the end of the level! 

* Unlimited Run And Rapid Fire: At the main title screen, press Left, Jump, Left, 1P, Left, Fire, Left, 1P. If this is done correctly there will be a message in the bottom left corner of the title screen a red POWER UP!. 

* Original Bubble Bobble: At the title screen, press Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Right, 1P. It will say at the bottom of screen ORIGINAL GAME. The game will give the PORTALS in some screens, if you can get in them you will get LOADS of diamonds. 

* The 'Super Bubble Bobble' Code: this will change the Bubble Bobble logo in 'Super Bubble Bobble' and the game will change under several points of view: different platform colors, different order for monster appearances... The code that must be entered at the title screen to access Super Bubble Bobble is displayed at the end of the credits after you beat the game in 2 players, normal mode. The message is coded, but it hints you to enter the secret room in level 20 to get the key for decoding. If you do so, you enter the secret room, on the base of which there is an inscription. The first line is the coding of the alphabet, the other lines are coded advices to beat the final boss. The decoded 'secret message' is: SJBLRJSR (Start - Jump - Bubble - Left - Right - Jump - Start - Right) 

The decoded advices in the secret rooms are: 
Room in level 20: IF YOU WANT TO BECOME THE OLD FIGURE, USE THE POWER OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP, AND FIGHT WITH ME! (hint to play in two player mode to defeat the final boss and see the real ending) 
Room in level 30: I ENCLOSE THESE MAGICAL MEDICINE HERE, BECAUSE THOSE ARE MY WORST FEARS... (hint to use the lighting bubble to beat the boss) 
Room in level 40: IF YOU WANT TO GET BACK YOUR LOVE OF TRUTH, YOU MUST HELP EACH OTHER UNTIL THE LAST... (hint to end the game in two player mode to see the real endings) 

A little more trivia on Super Bubble Bobble: If you beat the game in Super mode, two players, you will discover that the final boss is your mother and father that were controlled by some unknown evil. By defeating the boss you free them and your girlfriends, and are reverted back to your original human form (the one you play "Rainbow Island" with). 

* Secret Tombs: Make it to level 20 without dying and a door appears -- it leads to a 'secret tomb', a level full of diamonds. There are secret tombs at levels 20 and 30, also. Make it to level 50 without dying and a strange, bee-hive-shaped door appears; enter it and you warp to level 70. DON'T kill the Drunks on level 50, or the door disappears; bubble them and wait! Btw, with two players, only one of the players must survive unharmed to get the secret door. 

* Paffing A Skel: Skel, also known as 'Baron Von Blubba', is that nasty white monster that comes after you when you've taken too long; with two players, two Skels will appear. If one player is killed by HIS Skel, then he can collide with his partner's Skel 'WHILE HE IS STILL FLICKERING'. If the player's icon is still flickering, the other player's Skel will disappear (poof!), with no harm to the once-slain character. 

* Full Ending Sequence: Beat the game with two players in Super mode and you'll get the full end sequence. 

* High Score Codes: after getting a high score, enter your initials as: 
'SEX' - Pitch fork-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds. 
'TAK' - Octopus-turns bubbles into X's at end of level. 
'STR' - Flamingo-turns bubbles into smiling turds at end of level. 
'KTT' - Beer-turns bubbles into pizzas at end of level, what a perfect match !!! 
'...' - Knife-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds. 
'I.F', 'MTJ', 'NSO', 'KIM', 'YSH' - Coke can-flying sunflowers across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 34 years ago:

Cabal (c) 1988 TAD Corporation.

Cabal is a war themed shoot-em-up with one or simultaneous two-player gameplay in which two unnamed commandos must battle through five different stages - each containing four screens of play - to reach and defeat an evil dictator.

The game is an into-the-screen shooter with the action viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The commandos can move left and right to avoid incoming fire while the enemies themselves are targeted by moving an on-screen cross-hair over them and pressing fire. If the fire button is held down, the commando remains static, allowing for more accurate targeting of the cross-hair. While static, the commandos are vulnerable to incoming enemy fire.

Initially, the commandos are armed with only a standard single-shot gun (albeit with unlimited-ammunition) and a limited number of grenades, but additional grenades and weapon power-ups can be earned as play progresses.

As well as enemy troops, vehicles such as tanks, armoured cars and helicopters also appear and take numerous shots to destroy. When destroyed or killed, some on-screen targets release points bonuses and weapon power-ups that drop to the bottom of the screen and can be picked up by the commandos. Weapon power-ups include additional grenades, a rapid-fire machine and an automatic shotgun, which has a slightly lower firing rate but has a larger targeting cross-hair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot.

Each of the game's screens is littered with buildings and barricades that can also be destroyed. This removes enemy cover as well as earning players bonus points.

- TRIVIA -

Cabal was released in September 1988. It was the first video game developed by TAD.

According the a programmer at TAD, the source code of Cabal was not clean and not optimized.

A bootleg of this game was made by 'RED Corporation'.

- UPDATES -

The US version is slightly different, it has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.

In the bootleg version, you may roll up with the third button.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The game have a 'anti-leeching' tool. If you delay a lot of minutes (between 4 and 5 minutes) on the same stage/screen, you will receive a hard 'rain of bombs', like that bombs the airplanes shoot on you. Try to do it on the stage 1-1, the easiest. And if you delay a lot of time in the same position of the 'enemy' bar, without progress, you will receive this rain of bombs easily. Yeah, if you are expert, you will can survive to these bombs, without die, using your skill on the 'rolling' move. You will receive a lot of items (bombs, weapons) if you destroy bombs or if you shoot at the bush.

* General Tips:
1) Killing people and motorcycles (and rocks) won't get you many points -- don't bother unless they get in your way.
2) A well-placed grenade will destroy two choppers.
3) If you are in a corner and a chopper is firing at you, run farther into the corner. Even if you're already IN the corner, if it sees you trying to move toward the corner, you won't die.
4) If you find yourself trapped by incoming bullets, spin the trackball down and to one side (but mostly down). This will cause your character to 'duck and roll'. If you are rolling, you can't be hit.
5) Kill the snipers (the guys in gray bullet-proof suits). Half the time you'll get a grenade for killing him. If you don't, two medics will come running out to reclaim the body. Shoot these medics as much as possible! Each shot they will drop 1 grenade. But the limit is 4 grenades on the screen at the same time. Pick up these grenades as quickly as possible and shoot the medics again for more grenades. Sometimes they will drop new weapons too.
6) On the level one screen with the sliding doors: shoot out the doors immediately upon starting the level. This will stop the guys from lobbing grenades at you.
7) Airplanes are hard to kill. The best method is by using machine gun or bazooka gun on it. In the absence of a super-gun, you can lead a grenade ABOVE where it is on the screen. If you don't get it, and the three bombs are being dropped right on you, it IS possible to stand BETWEEN where two bombs are coming down. You WON'T die!
8) When there's nothing good to shoot on the screen, fire at a bush. This is the way to get extra gunnery! Sometimes you'll only get more grenades, but you'll eventually get a super-gun!

* Tips For Specific Enemies:
1) The giant chopper that shows up at the end of screen 4 on level one doesn't give you any points until you destroy it. Shooting the orange bullets won't knock off any points toward killing the chopper. Only shoot the orange bullets if they're in your way. Otherwise, spend all your time shooting the chopper. Don't waste any grenades on the chopper--it doesn't do as much damage as your gun (and you have unlimited bullets).
2) The semi-truck that shows up at the end of screen 4 on level three will self-destruct if you destroy the CAB (the blue section in the front of it). On this screen you actually get the point for it as well. It is easiest to kill it with the machine gun and/or bazooka gun, but in the absence of either of these, throw grenades at the cab (leading the throw by about four inches). It is MUCH easier to destroy the cab rather than destroying all the attack sections that it drops off.
3) The three CPUs that show up at the end of screen 4 on level four can actually be destroyed with only 2 grenades (I had to do this once when my grenade supply got low), but the best strategy is to lob five grenades at one of the outside CPUs (note that you can only have four grenades per player in the air at any given time, so space them out a bit), then go for the CENTER one (with another five grenades). The final CPU can simply be shot with the standard rifle, and if you're standing on the opposite side of the screen from it, it won't be able to hit you. Don't waste any more grenades.
4) Once you learn how to defeat the final menace (at the end of screen 4 on level five -- the final level) you can get by it (rather) painlessly. Go all the way to one side. Use your gun to shoot out the two surrounding machines that are shooting at you. As soon as they are both gone, lob three grenades at the center machine. By this time, the two outer machines that you shot out have regenerated and are firing at you. Shoot them out again, followed by another volley of three grenades to the center machine. Repeat until the center machine is gone. This requires 20 to 40 grenades, so stock up on the last level (5-4). That is what that final level was for.

Cameltry (c) 1990 Taito Corp.

The player must guide a ball through a number of mazes, rotating the maze through 180 degrees to get the ball to move in the desired direction - much like the special stages in the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive title, "Sonic the Hedgehog". Each maze must be completed within a tight time limit, and a number of traps and obstacles litter the mazes to slow players down.

There are, however, a number of positive targets to be hit, and bonuses - such as additional time - can be found hidden away within the mazes. When the ball is stuck or the player would like to speed up, the JUMP button can be used. If the player runs out of time before reaching the goal, a random matching game is run to allow the player more time to complete the maze. This challenge, however, is very difficult to win.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the "Taito F2 System" hardware. It used a graphics extension on the board, the so called Taito F2 Expanded System.

Prom Stickers: C38

Players: 2
Control: Spinner
Buttons: 1

- TRIVIA -

Even if the title screen says 1989, Cameltry was released in April 1990.

This game uses inertia and gravity to simulate how an actual ball in a maze would roll, under real-life conditions. This is what makes this game fun to play.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Cameltry, Cadash - PCCB-00043) on October 21, 1990.

Zuntata Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Zuntata History L'ab-normal 1st - ZTTL-0038) on April 1, 1999.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Obtain a very high time and you can gain 1000 points, featuring Tiki (the Kiwi Bird of "The New Zealand Story" game) or another character of Taito.

* If you complete a stage with less than 10 seconds remaining, a slot machine appears. The numbers on all 3 reels will be added as a bonus time. This does not happen on the special courses. 

* Round Select: Hold Service Switch at boot.
Input: Start(x3), Service Switch, Start on Service Switch Error message screen. This code (Taito Command) is used in many Taito games, G-Darius, Rastan Saga II, Gunlock/Ray Force etc.

* Ball Selection: If you hold down the START button while selecting a course (except the training course) you can change the appearance of the ball.

* Secret Bonus: If the 3 digits on the timer is the same at goal (eg 11.1, 22.2, 33.3, etc), secret bonus is added.

* Staff Credits: When seeing the ending, hold the JUMP button. NOTE: It's disabled when you select Training course.

Cannonball was Owen Rubin's first game at Atari. It is not known for sure if this game was ever produced, as there is no documentation or flyers of the game that have surfaced. Owen Rubin seems to think that maybe it WAS produced; however, he is unsure.

Owen wrote Cannonball while sitting in his small office at a Model 33 teletype connected to a Motorola MicBug 6800 processor, both of which were connected to simple videogame hardware. He hand-assembled the entire program--it was only 2K, but still took several months--including self-test, saving the code on punched paper tape. When his boss reviewed the game and asked for code listings, Owen said, 'What listings?' It turns out that Owen didn't know about the two computer operators, who took the listings that the designers/programmers wrote up, typed them into the PDP-1 computers, ran them to make sure they were error-free, then return a paper tape to the designer.

Crazy Climber (c) 1980 Nichibutsu [Nihon Bussan Company, Limited.].

Crazy Climber is a 2-D, strategy style game. The game is strategic in the fact that you must plan your moves as you climb up the building and anticipate the hazards that await you. You start out the game at the bottom of a building to be scaled. As you climb up the building, you will be assailed by bald people throwing flowerpots, signs with loose electrical wires, very large apes, falling signs, trash and barbells, and a bird that likes to drop bad things on your character. Your goal is to make it to the top of the building and catch the helicopter, which will transport you to the next building to be scaled. Of course, you will be rewarded for quickly making it up the building by getting a bonus (that is as long as you can catch the helicopter). The things one does for publicity.

- TRIVIA -

Crazy Climber was released in October 1980. It was Fujiwara's first game.

The names of each building to climb in the game are 'Nichibutsu', 'Nichibutsu Leisure', 'Nichibutsu U.K. Ltd.' and 'Nichibutsu U.S.A Corp.'.

Some of the musical themes used in the game are 'Baby Elephant Walk', 'The Pink Panther Theme' and 'The Entertainer'.

Jim Wright holds the official record for this game with 487,150 points on July 5, 1982 with three starting lives.
Jason Cram holds the official record for this game with 301, 950 points on November 21, 2003 with four starting lives.

A Crazy Climber unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Rocky III'.

Bandai released a board game based on this video game (same name): This game has you playing cards to move to the top of a building. Like in the arcade, there is the peril that people seem to drop just about anything out their windows at random times. Each card allows you to move to a particular position relative to where you currently are (for example, a choice of straight up two squares or up two squares and left or right one). However, there must be an open window that is not occupied by another player for it to be a legal move. Whenever a player passes certain checkpoints, the spinner is spun to see if anything falls from the windows. If you're hit on the head, you drop down to the next open window. There is also a gorilla that knocks you all the way down if you're unfortunate enough to be hit by him. First one to get to the top of the building and escape on the helicopter wins.

- SCORING -

Each building has a STEP POINT heading. This indicates how many points you get for each window you successfully climb to. You also start out with a certain amount of bonus points per building. On buildings one and two, they decrease by 100 about every 2 seconds while on buildings three and four they decrease by 200 points about every 2 seconds. Below are listed the STEP POINT and BONUS
RATE points:
Building 1 - Step Point: 100 - Bonus Rate: 10000
Building 2 - Step Point: 150 - Bonus Rate: 20000
Building 3 - Step Point: 200 - Bonus Rate: 30000
Building 4 - Step Point: 250 - Bonus Rate: 40000

NOTE: You will only collect the remaining BONUS RATE if you successfully grab the helicopter at the top of the building. If you fail to grab the helicopter after it has made two passes, you get a consolation bonus of 3000 points regardless of what the BONUS RATE remaining is.

The balloon shows up during buildings two and three. You don't get points, perse, for grabbing the balloon. Instead, your character will get lifted up approximately ten stories and avoiding any hazards they may contain. You will get STEP POINTS for these bypassed stories as if you had actually climbed them. In addition, it will give you a bigger bonus since it is quicker going up the building like this.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your climber will climb a couple of steps. Then it will be up to you to guide him to the top of the building. The hardest aspect of this game is developing a rhythm with the controls to enable your climber to climb smoothly. This is something that takes practice. Fortunately, once you've developed this rhythm, the game is much easier to play. The basic rhythm is:
1) From the bottom ledge, reach up to the next ledge (left or right joystick).
2) Once you've got a hold on the next ledge, pull back on the joystick to bring your climber to the next ledge.
3) Use the opposite joystick to reach for the next ledge. Then pull yourself up.
4) Continue this rhythm for fast, straight climbs.
5) This also works for climbing diagonally. Instead of reaching for the ledge above, reach for the upper right or left ledge diagonal from your climber.

* You can move your climber from side to side just by pushing both joysticks to the right or left. As long as windows are open along your path, you can execute this move. Good for avoiding objects dropping on you such as signs and garbage.

* All the buildings have the following hazards:
1) Windows opening and closing: You cannot climb on a ledge if the window is closed. On building 1, they open and close slowly while on building 4, they open and close quickly.
2) Bald people throwing flowerpots out the windows: You cannot climb on a ledge if a person is in the window. Also, if a flowerpot hits your climber, you will get one hand knocked off the ledge. If you were only holding on by one hand, your climber falls.
3) A pesky bird flies over dropping nifty things on your climber (only building 3 doesn't have this bird): Again, not much trouble if you are holding onto a ledge with both hands.

* If you are holding onto a ledge with both hands and the window closes, your climber will fall. This is why you need to either quickly move up the building or learn how to move diagonally to avoid the window hazards. In addition, you will have to move diagonally when the building configuration is 4-2.

* BUILDING 1: Besides the above hazards, there is only one other hazard to deal with...
1) The bird shows up when the building configuration goes from a 6-2-2 to a 6 for the second time.
2) People will drop flowerpots on you when the building goes from 6-2-2 for the first time to 6-2-2 the second time.
3) King Kong will be at the point where the building goes to 6-2 the second time. To get by Kong, just go up the windows on the opposite side Kong is on.

* BUILDING 2: The usual hazards exist along with another new one.
1) The bird shows up when the building configuration goes from 6-4 the second time to the middle of the 4 configuration.
2) People drop flowerpots when the building goes to 2 until it goes to 2-4.
3) When the building goes 6-2-2, there is a Nichibutsu sign with wires coming out of either side sparking away. The best path is the right one under the sign.
4) Try to get the balloon which appears midway on the final 4 wide configuration.

* BUILDING 3: There is yet another new hazard along with a couple of old ones.
1) People drop flowerpots from the first 6-2-2 configuration to the second 6-2-2 configuration.
2) Right after the 6-4 configuration, Crazy Climber signs will bounce toward your character. There are a couple of methods of dealing with them:
a) First, just slide left or right to avoid them.
b) If they can't be avoided, get both hands on one ledge and pull the joysticks back. This will bring your climber for a hanging position to one where he is resting on his palms. This sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Also, right when the sign is about to hit him, pull back on the joysticks.
3) Another King Kong awaits where the building goes from 4 to 2. Use the Building 1 method to scoot by him.
4) Again, try to get the balloon which appears midway on the final 2 wide configuration.

* BUILDING 4: There is another hazard in addition to the above. Plus, things happen quickly on this building.
1) In the middle of the first 6-2-2 configuration, is another sign with electrical wires. Use the method from Building 2.
2) The bird appears at the 6-2 configuration and leaves in the middle of the first 2 configuration.
3) From the 2-6 configuration to the middle of the 6 configuration, people are dropping flowerpots on your head.
4) When you come to the final 4-2 configuration, it is usually better to go to the left. This is because the Crazy Climber signs usually come down the right side. Of course, this isn't always true. Use the methods in Building 3 to deal with them.
5) Throughout your climb up this building, various manners of barbells, trash. There is no real defense against these except hold on tightly.
6) Once you complete this building, you are transported back to Building 1 to start again.

* Secret Password: Enter the name 'jordan.ltd' in the high score table and you get two free credits. This only works on the Japanese and bootleg versions of the game (although the password code is still present in the US version, the high score table entry has been crippled to only allow 3 letters, so you can't enter the code).

Centipede (c) 1981 Atari.

Centipede is a vertically oriented single screen shoot-em-up in which the aim is to use the 'Bug Blaster' to shoot the centipedes that snake down towards the bottom of the screen to amass as high a score as possible. 

The play-field is littered with randomly placed mushrooms and the rapidly descending Centipede changes direction when it runs into a mushroom. When a segment of the Centipede is shot, the segment is destroyed and a mushroom appears in its place, the Centipede then breaks into two smaller centipedes, each with its own head, and continues its descent. 

Players can move the Bug Blaster vertically as well as horizontally, although only for the lower fifth of the play-field. Mushrooms can also be shot for points and to clear blocked areas. Once a Centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts snaking back up, but remains within the lower section of the play-field near the player's Bug Blaster.

Additionally, any Centipede that reaches the very bottom of the screen without being shot releases its tail section which then becomes a new head. Other new heads also enter the screen from the bottom corners of the play-field as time progresses.

Randomly moving Spiders also appear in the first wave. Spiders can destroy any mushrooms they move over, eliminating many mushroom targets for a player. If the Bug Blaster and a Spider collide, both are destroyed. the Spider either moves at a 45-degree angle or vertically up and down, never simply left or right like the centipede does.

A bombardment of Fleas appears from the second wave onward. As a Flea descends, it leaves a trail of new mushrooms behind it. Fleas appear when a certain number of mushrooms remains at the bottom of the screen. This number increases as the game progresses, meaning Fleas appear more often later on in the game. The Bug Blaster must hit a Flea twice to destroy it; the first shot simply speeds up its descent.

When a Centipede with fewer than eleven segments appears, a Scorpion enters from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Scorpion's speed increases. As the Scorpion travels across the screen, it 'poisons' the mushrooms that it moves over and changes their colours. These mushrooms cause any Centipedes that would collide with them to head straight towards the bottom of the screen, rather than continue snaking left and right. The Bug Blaster can stop a poisoned Centipede by shooting its head.

If a player earns at least 60,000 points, two things happen to increase the challenge: the Fleas descend at a faster speed and the Spiders restrict their movement to a smaller area at the bottom of the screen.

- TRIVIA -

The original Upright model of Centipede was released in June 1981 (even though the copyright at the bottom of the screen in the game's attract mode says 1980), and was sold $1,995 at its release. 46,062 units were produced. It's Atari's second bestselling coin-op game.

It was an Atari coin-operated game that swiftly won a wide following in the arcades. Apart from its smooth game play, Centipede was praised for its refreshing approach to screen colors and for its whimsical mushroom world. 

Centipede was the first coin-op game to be designed by a woman - Dona Bailey. But Ed Logg did the majority of the work on Centipede; Dona only came up with the prototype idea, where the mushrooms were indestructible and it was more like "Space Invaders". Like "Pac-Man", this game has special appeal to women. 

* The Creation of Centipede: Centipede was written by veteran Atari designer Ed Logg, who has become something of a legend in the world of video games, and a young game programmer who was credited with bringing a gentler touch to the world of video games with the enchanted mushroom patch. 

Steve Calfee: 'Ed Logg is the world's greatest games designer. He's done the most, the best games. His line up starts with "Asteroids", which probably still is the biggest run we ever did. He's in [a long line of games]. He's kind of like Pete Rose; he has the most hits and he's also probably got the most strike outs. He just goes up to bat.' 

* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters: The mushroom patch with its tenacious, never-say-die centipedes, bouncing spiders, mushroom-laying fleas and transforming scorpions provided an imaginative leap for players, just as did the hoards of aliens in "Tempest", the outer space adventures of "Asteroids", the eerie battlefields of "Battlezone" and even the frightful scenarios of "Missile Command". Of these times, and the games that emerged from Atari, Rich Adam said: 'We were a young group of fun people who were sort of treading on untrodden territory. We were out exploring what technology could do to entertain adolescent minds, and we were adolescent minds.' 

In the early days of personal computers, before they became commonplace, and before sophisticated gaming programs were available for them, the arcades (and wherever else the coin-operated games were located) were the portals into these new fantasy worlds. And a river of quarters carried players into the electronic realms. Dan Pliskin described the coin-operated video game business as follows: "It was a wacky, extremely competitive business. I was there when coin-operated games were earning $8 billion in quarters a year. These games were out-grossing the record industry and the movie industry combined, in quarters! And when you looked at who was manufacturing these games, it was just a couple of Japanese companies and a few American companies.... There was incredible competition, all for kids' lunch and church money!" 

The quarters are still rolling in. Dan Pliskin continued: "People say that video games have already seen their heyday and business has definitely gone downhill. Maybe it has gone downhill. Maybe it's only $4 billion worth of quarters now. It's still one heck of an industry." 

* Popular from the Start: The prototype games were hand-built, wire-wrapped, one-of-a kinds that were created by the development team prior to ordering the circuit boards for the mass-produced versions. With just a single machine, people would come in at all hours of the night to play a new game. 

Dan Pliskin: 'One of the things that kind of allowed everybody at Atari to have kind of a loose and enjoyable relationship was that management was kind of loose, too. An example of that happened with one of Howard Delman's games. I can't remember which one it was, but we sent the one and only prototype wire-wrapped version of Howie's game off to the AMOA (Amusement and Music Operators Association) show with strict orders not to sell it.' 

Of course the game was sold anyway, and a new prototype had to be assembled back at the labs. Dan Pliskin continued: 'Several months later Howie gets a call from the person who bought this game. It had stopped collecting money and he wanted to know how to change the settings to make it play longer, or something, to see if it would earn more money. Howie had to tell the guy that if it ever collected any money at all, it was a miracle because it didn't have any coin routines at all. It had none, because we had wired it for free-play when we sent it to the AMOA show!' 

* The Great 25-Cent Escape: Especially in the early 1980s a great many newspaper and magazine articles were written about the meaning of and possible consequences of the wave of video games that seemed to allure so many kids, and adults, to the arcades. But at the heart of it might have been the promise of a quick escape into another world. 

Rich Adam: "I kind of figured out, maybe years after the fact, what I think the lure of video games is. It's because people have so little control over their lives. This is especially true with kids, but even adults often have little control over the day-to-day part of their lives. You have to go to work. You don't get to control that much of your life. But for a quarter you can control this very complex machine. You can command it. For a quarter that's quite a bargain, to be able to do that for five minutes... When you're good at a game it gives you an incredible sense of power over the whole environment.". 

Centipede was the 1st UL (Underwriter's Laboratories) approved game. 

Jim Schneider holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 16,389,547 points on August 1, 1984. 

Donald Hayes holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 7,111,111 points on November 5, 2000. 

Note 1: The upright side artwork features a grasshopper, while it is not present during game-play. In test mode you can cycle through the different graphical objects used in the game (the player, a mushroom, a spider, a scorpion, a flea and a grasshopper). Grasshopper?! Yes, the game was to originally have had grasshoppers but they were taken out. You can still see them in the test however. 

Note 2: 'Centipede' is also the name of a terrifying, man-eating monster of the size of a mountain. This Japanese legend say that the dragon king of that particular lake asked the famous hero Hidesato to kill it for him. The hero slew it by shooting an arrow, dipped in his own saliva, into the brain of the monster. The dragon king rewarded Hidesato by giving him a rice-bag; a bag of rice which could not be emptied and it fed his family for centuries. 

Centipede inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Ode To A Centipede' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. 

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including CENTIPED. 

A Centipede unit appears in the 1982 movie "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", in the 1983 movie "WarGames", in the 1983 movie "James Bond 007 - Never Say Never Again", in the 1983 movie "Joysticks", in the 1984 movie "Body Double", in the 1985 movie "Teen Wolf", in the 1986 movie "Running Scared", in the 1987 movie "Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown", in the 1995 movie "Species" and in the 1996 movie 'House Arrest'. 

In 1982, Atari released a set of twelve collector pins including: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight". 

MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on Atari's Centipede. 

A Reimagined version of the Centipede franchise, was launched for the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Wii under name of "Centipede Infestation".

- SCORING -

Mushrooms &amp; Poisoned Mushrooms: 1 point (Takes four hits to destroy) 
Centipede (Body): 10 points 
Centipede (Head): 100 points 
Flea: 200 points (Takes two hits. First hit speeds it up, second hit destroys it) 
Spider: 300, 600, 900 points (Points increase the closer the Spider is to the Bug Blaster when hit) 
Scorpion: 1,000 points 

When the mushroom patch is reset after a player loses a life, each partially destroyed/poisoned mushroom that is restored awards the player 5 bonus points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, you will be put in the middle at the bottom of the screen. You have an area five mushrooms high (about 20% of the playing area) to maneuver your Bug Blaster in. The game will start when the enemies enter the screen. Know your enemies! This is the single most important aspect of this game. If you don't know how each of the enemies behave, you won't last long. The enemies are: 

1) Centipede (Body and Head): Goes back and forth across the screen. Will drop to the next level when it encounters a mushroom or the side of the game field. It will go all the way to the bottom when it hits a poisoned mushroom. 

2) Spider: These appear from the top left or right of the player area. They will either bounce across the player's area at 45-degree angles or bounce in at a 45-degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, go to the middle at a 45-degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, then finally go to the right side (at a 45-degree angle), bounce up and down, then exit the area. They destroy mushrooms they cross over. 

3) Flea: These appear in Wave 2. They will appear when you have cleared out most of the mushrooms in the player area.

4) Scorpion: These appear in Wave 3. They go across the screen and poison all the mushrooms in their path. 

* The Centipede will start out as a head and eleven body segments on Wave 1. Wave 2 will be a head with ten body segments and a head that enters from the opposite side. Wave 3 will be a head with nine body segments and two heads that enter from opposite sides. This progression keeps going until Wave 12 when all that enter the screen are heads. The progression then starts back up again in a never ending cycle. 

* You must eliminate the Wave 1 Centipede only once. Then, until you score reaches 40,000 points, you must destroy each subsequent Centipede wave twice--first as the Centipede moves slowly towards you, then as it moves fast. After your score reaches 40,000 points, each Centipede will only need to be destroyed once. 

* Shooting the Centipede can have two effects: 

1) If you shoot the head, that part turns into a mushroom and the next segment becomes the new head and the Centipede will travel in the opposite direction (since it hit the newly-created mushroom). 

2) If you shoot the middle of the body, then the segment hit will become a mushroom. The old Centipede will continue in the same direction. The new Centipede will develop a head at the next segment after the break and head off in the opposite direction. 

* A good strategy to ensure you destroy the Centipedes in one stroke and to keep the Fleas at bay is to create 'mushroom corridors'. Mushroom corridors are basically corridors between two rows of mushrooms where you can funnel the Centipede down and destroy it when it is moving head-first at your Bug Blaster. 

* A good defense against the Flea is to keep a certain amount of mushrooms on the screen. There is no hard set value but when the Fleas don't come down, you have enough. This number gets higher as your score increases. 

* Speaking of score, Fleas start traveling faster after 60,000 points. 

* Watch out for the Spiders. They enter at either the top or bottom corners. Your Bug Blaster may be in the way if this happens. In addition to collisions, the Spiders wipe out all mushrooms that are in its path. This can create problems when you are creating mushroom corridors. It can also cause the Fleas to appear since you won't have many mushrooms in the player area. 

* Spiders are unpredictable, so be careful. Sometimes they pounce using long, high leaps and sometimes it bounces in a series of short jumps. Aim your shots and plan your moves based on where the Spider is, and not where you think it is going.

* Remember that Spiders never turn back. Once one passes your Bug Blaster on its journey from one side of the mushroom patch to the next, you can ignore it. If the Spider emerges from the right side of the screen, it will work its way toward the left side of the screen, and vice versa. It may pause along its way to bounce straight up and down, but it will never reverse direction.

* Blast the Fleas! They are relatively easy to pick off, especially once you get good at moving your Bug Blaster smoothly across the bottom of the screen. Be careful, though! It takes two shots to kill a Flea and after the first hit the falling speed increases.

* Blast the Fleas as soon as you can. Stop them from laying mushrooms because you'll just have to blast them out of the way later. The more mushroom on the screen (especially in the player area), the more quickly the Centipedes work their way to the bottom. 

* If you don't like Fleas, always leave five mushrooms in your area (out of your line of fire). Fleas stop falling when there are five or more mushrooms in the player area. But be on the lookout for Spiders. They destroy mushrooms and if the count drops below five, the Fleas start falling again.

* Keep track of where the Scorpions move across the screen. As soon as the Centipede hits a poisoned mushroom, it will immediately head for the bottom of the screen. The only way to stop this headlong plunge is to shoot it in the head. In the later waves, it is not uncommon to have multiple Scorpions going across the screen. They also provide the most points in the game, but they are hard to get. Often rows of mushrooms protect them. 

* Play the cycles. As the waves progress and more Centipede segments are entering the mushroom patch as independent heads, put more effort into blasting the heads than into chasing Fleas and Spiders. If your area gets too crowded with Centipede heads, you'll have to move your Bug Blaster with exceptional speed and smoothness to stay alive.

* If you get unlucky and let the Centipede into your area, you need to destroy it before it gets to the bottom of the player area. Once it reaches the bottom, it will ascend (it will never leave the player area, though). If it does reach the bottom of the player area, another head will come out from the opposite side to start its back and forth march across the screen. This will continue until you destroy all the Centipede parts in the player area or until your Bug Blaster is destroyed.

* If your Bug Blaster gets destroyed, all partially shot up mushrooms are regenerated, all poisoned mushrooms are restored to normal, and you start at the beginning of the wave you got killed on. 

* Depending on machine set up, all enemies (except the Centipede and Flea) speed up at the 1,000 or 5,000 point mark. 

* Bottom Side Tunnels: To perform this trick, you must do the following... 

1) When the Centipede is one row over the player's area (fifth mushroom up), go to the opposite side that the Centipede is on. 

2) When the Centipede turns around, it will be in the player's area. It then will make it to the side you are on. Right when it hits the side of the screen and turns around, shoot it. This creates a mushroom and forces the Centipede to turn around and go down one level. 

3) Again, after the Centipede hits the wall, shoot it, create a mushroom, and force it down another level. 

4) Continue to do this until you have only the bottom part left. There are two ways to do this: 
a) If you get killed by the Centipede, this will also create a mushroom and you will have a vertical line of mushrooms along one of the side. 
b) If you are quick, you can pick off the Centipede and create this last mushroom. 

5) Repeat this for the other side. 

6) Regardless of how you create this 'Side Tunnel', you will now have a trapped Centipede since the only thing it can do is go up and down within the player's area. New heads that come out will also be trapped. 

7) Now you can pick off enemies at your leisure. The only enemy you need to make sure you take out is the Spider since it can wipe out part of your 'Side Tunnel'. 

8) Good players consider this 'cheating' since it basically lets the player have free reign over the game. 

* Central Tunnel: This trick works along the same line as the 'Bottom Side Tunnel' trick. The difference is that you create a tunnel down the center of the screen... 

1) When the Centipede starts its descent, hit it. This will cause it to reverse direction after hitting the new mushroom. 

2) After going one or two mushroom lengths, hit it. Again, this will cause it to reverse direction. 

3) Continue to do this until you have built a 'tunnel' that touches the player's area. 

4) Also make sure you build up mushrooms to the left and right of the tunnel to prevent the Fleas from coming down and depositing their random mushrooms. 

5) From this point on, when the Centipede approaches your tunnel, all it will take is one hit to force it to descend. In a sense, you are causing the same effect that a Scorpion causes, but on your terms. 

6) Since you are keeping the top left and right areas clear, it should take a longer time for the individual heads to make it to the player's area. 

7) It will take a few waves to build up your areas. Once built up, you should be the master of the game. 

8) As for the other tunnel, make sure you take care of the Spiders when they first enter so they don't do any damage to your 'Central Tunnel'. 

9) Also make sure that you keep your tunnel cleared out by destroying any stray mushrooms within it. 

* Fortress: If you are patient, you could build a mushroom fortress around your Bug Blaster. Then all you would do is shoot Spiders for the rest of the game.

		<name>Continental Circus</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 34 years ago:

Continental Circus (c) 1988 Taito.

Continental Circus is a Formula One racing game in which the player races over a number of International Grand Prix circuits, trying to complete each lap before the time limit expires. The game features Pit-stops and dynamic weather; the latter in the form of rain.

If the player's car is hit by either a rival car or strikes a trackside barrier, the car will be damaged and begin to smoke. The player must 'pit' at the earliest opportunity to get the car repaired, otherwise the fire will spread and the car will eventually explode. Should the player's car have a second collision before the Pit-stop is reached, the car will explode, wasting precious time before a replacement car appears.

Continental Circus' Grand Prix tracks are as follows:
BRAZIL / Brazil GP - Qualified Rank 80
AMERICA / U.S.A GP - Qualified Rank 60
FRANCE / French GP - Qualified Rank 50
MONACO / Monaco GP - Qualified Rank 40
GERMANY / Germany GP - Qualified Rank 30
SPAIN / Spain GP - Qualified Rank 20
MEXICO / Mexico GP - Qualified Rank 10
JAPAN / Japan GP - Qualified Rank 3

- TRIVIA -

Even if the title screen says 1987, Continental Circus was released in March 1988 in Japan.

Like Nintendo's 1981 classic, "Donkey Kong", Continental Circus was the victim of a mistake during the translation from Japanese to English. The game was originally to be called 'Continental Circuits'. All the artwork on the US games was later corrected to say 'Continental Circuit' but the original Taito PCBs are clearly labeled with the epithet, 'Circus'. Note: F1 is often called the 'F1 circus' because it is like a big circus that travels to different cities across different continents.

Continental Circus was unique at the time in that certain cabinets came supplied with a '3D visor', through which the player viewed the action. The visor, similar in outward appearance to the one used in Atari's "Battlezone", produced a simple but effective 3D effect. This effect could be disabled by the arcade operator via the dip switch settings.

This game was released outside the US a year later (in 1989).

The race car driven by the player is the 1987 Camel-sponsored Honda/Lotus 99T Formula 1 car as driven by Ayrton Senna (1960-1994) and Satoru Nakajima. Sponsor names such as 'Camel' and 'DeLonghi' are misspelled deliberately to prevent copyright infringement under Japanese law.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Kyukyoku Tiger: G.S.M. Taito 2 - D28B0008) on November 21, 1988.

魂斗羅 (c) 1987 Konami.
(Contra)

In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien being. Two years later, a terrorist organization calling themselves Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

'Contra' is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also "3D maze" stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are:
Machine Gun: Auto-fire.
Spread gun [S]: Allows the player to fire 5 shots in an arc.
Laser: Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.
Fire Ball [F]: A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.
Rapid Bullets [R]: Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon. Works with the Machine Gun and Fire Ball.
Barrier [B]: Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.

The game consists of ten stages:
Stage 01: Jungle (horizontal scroll)
Stage 02: Inside Base 1 (3D maze)
Stage 03: Core of Base 1 (3D fixed)
Stage 04: Waterfall (vertical scroll)
Stage 05: Inside Base 2 (3D maze)
Stage 06: Core of Base 2 (3D fixed)
Stage 07: Snow Field (horizontal scroll)
Stage 08: Energy Zone (horizontal scroll)
Stage 09: Hangar (horizontal scroll)
Stage 10: Alien Lair (horizontal scroll)

- TRIVIA -

Contra was released in February 1987.

This game is known in Europe as "Gryzor".

Note: The Japanese version uses kanji (Chinese characters) to phonetically spell out 'Kon-to-ra', the Japanese transliteration of the name "Contra". This is an example of ateji, in which an artist uses kanji for their phonetic value rather than any meaning they may have.

Here are the official names of the characters: Bill Rizer (player 1) and Lance Bean (player 2). They were named after the following actors, all of which appeared in the 1986 movie, Aliens; Bill Rizer is named after the actors Bill Paxton and Paul Reiser, while Lance Bean is named after Lance Henriksen and Michael Biehn.

Bill Rizer makes an appearance as a supporting character in the 1992 Family Computer game "Wai Wai World 2 SOS!! - Paseri Jou".

The music from the final stage is also used for the final boss confrontation in "Wai Wai World" for the Family Computer.

Chad Johnson holds the official record for this game with 1, 546, 600 points on July 15, 2002.

Alpha Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.4 - 28XA-201) on March 10, 1988.

Literatures:
[JP] June 05, 1998; Contra [Konami Game Books Series 4]

- UPDATES -

The game's backstory differs between sources. The storyline written above is the one used by Japanese sources and later mentioned in canon in Contra: Shattered Soldier for the PlayStation 2. In the North American manual for the NES version, the time was changed from the 27th century to the present day, with the location moved from Galuga to an unnamed South American island. Bill and Lance were given the codenames 'Mad Dog' and 'Scorpion', names which were later used for 2 unrelated characters in the American-produced Contra 4 for the Nintendo DS.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Weapons
1) Shotgun: Your default weapon, can fire suprisingly fast.
2) Spread Gun: Shoots waves of expanding blobs. Outstanding.
3) Laser: Hold down fire for a longer beam. Powerful.
4) Fireball: Fires spinning red blobs.
5) Machine Gun: Rapid fire bullets. Sounds like a drum machine.
6) Rapid: Speeds up shotgun, fireball &amp; machine gun bullets. Handy.
7) Barrier: Complete invulnerability for a limited time. Nice.

* Use shots wisely: Jump shots and crouch shots allow you to attack while avoiding enemy attacks. Do not hesitate. Keep those shots going!

* Kill before being killed: if you see an enemy, shoot right away. Defeat them before they fire at you. Be the first one to attack!

* Tip for taking down the fortress: At the end of Stage 1 (the Jungle) and Stage 4 (the Waterfall), you will find yourself at the heavily fortified entrance of the next base. To gain access to the base, you will need to destroy the large sensor. The sensor in Stage 1 is guarded by a sniper and two mortar cannons, while the sensor in Stage 4 is guarded by a large five-way cannon at middle, with two rotating guns around it (one on each side).

* Tips for 3-D mazes: Destroy the orb-shaped sensors in each wall to stop the high voltage electric currents. Taking out the weak points quickly is key to conquering the 3-D levels before time runs out. 

If you press the joystick upward and touch the electricity, you will be stunned and won't be able to move for a while. Don't move forward until you take out the sensor and stop the electricity. 

After you take out the weak point, look at the map while proceeding. You'll know whether to go left or right. 

You can dodge enemy bullets by lying down! Destroy rolling mines by using crouch shots.

As you proceed, there are weak points that are positioned so that you can't reach them. Utilize jump shots and crouch shots.

* Beware of falling off at Stage 4: In the waterfall, missing a platform and falling down will count as a miss.

* Barrier: The Barrier power-up can only be found at the beginning of Stage 4 (the Waterfall) or halfway through Stage 9 (the Hangar) if the player has only their normal gun equipped

* Rapid Bullets: The Rapid Bullets power-up will only appear in the beginning of the Waterfall stage and halfway through Snow Field stage (before fighting the first tank) if the player has only the normal gun equipped. Because of this, the only weapons the Rapid Bullets upgrade can be used with are the normal gun, the Fire Ball gun, and the Machine Gun.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 33 years ago:

Crime City (c) 1989 Taito Corporation.

Crime City is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up for one or two players in which two cops by the names of Tony Gibson and Raymond Brody are tasked with taking down the gangs of criminals that have overrun their city. 

Each of the game's six stages focuses on a specific criminal activity, such as bank robbery or smuggling. The goal of each stage is to reach the powerful 'boss' character then defeat and arrest them.

The game's heroes start each stage armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons become available as players progress through the stage. Both the pistol and additional weapons - which include a machine-gun, an armour-piercing gun and a threeway gun - have only a limited amount of ammunition and if players run out of ammo, they will only be able to punch or 'somersault attack' the attacking enemies. 

Each stage features background objects that can be used against the enemies, such as wooden barrels, boxes and hanging lights. When shot, some criminals drop packets of illegal drugs, which can be picked up for bonus points.

The game's lead characters of Tony Gibson and Raymond Brody were also the lead characters in Taito's 1988 crime-themed racing game, Chase HQ. Crime City's gameplay takes its inspiration from Namco's Rolling Thunder.

The game's final three stages focus on the kidnapping of the city's mayor, ending with a final confrontation with the city's kingpin of crime himself. The six stages are:
* Prison Break
* Bank Robbery
* Smuggling
* Kidnapping (Round 1)
* Kidnapping (Round 2)
* Kidnapping (Round 3)

Cyber-Lip (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

Cyber-Lip is a platform shoot-em-up for one or two players that borrows heavily from Konami's "Contra" series. Players must battle through sideways-scrolling levels, to defeat armies of cyborgs and androids and restore order and peace to the world.

Cyber-Lip has two shooting modes, one for standard weapon use and one for rocket launchers and grenade throwing. Players can switch between the two modes at any time, but only carry a limited amount of grenades or rockets. Weapon power-ups and additional grenades and rockets can be picked up throughout the levels.

At the end of certain levels, the game's heroes will enter an elevator and players can then choose whether to go 'up' or 'down', depending on which route through the game they wish to take. Each level has a large end-of-level boss that must be defeated.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 24 years ago:

The Fallen Angels (c) 1998 Psikyo.

A very solid 2-D fighting game with beautiful pre-rendered backgrounds. 8 selectable fighters and 2 end bosses.

- TECHNICAL -

Main CPU: SH-2 (@ 28.63635 Mhz)

=&gt; Weak Punch, Strong Punch, Weak Kick, Strong Kick

- TRIVIA -

The Fallen Angels was shown at the 1998 AOU Amusement Expo show, in Japan. It was then released in March 1998 in Japan. It was known in Japan as "Daraku Tenshi" (translates from Japanese as 'Fallen Angel').

Using the Bitmap Dump option in the test menu you can come across several title screens. "Gut Reaction", "Rubbin Out" and "A Blow For Freedom". There are 2 screens for "Gut Reaction".

They also misspelt start as 'strat' in the test screen.

Hidden within the graphic ROMs are the sprites of four characters that were taken out of the game. It is believed that the game may have not been entirely completed, given that four characters were cut from the game, the character bio's contain varying errors, and some of the staff went over to SNK (Cool and Harry appear very similar to KOF 99's K' and Maxiama characters).

Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Daraku Tenshi: The Fallen Angels - PCCB-00305) on 01/04/1998.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Unlock Extra Maintenance: if you hold Test Button + PL1 Button 1 during boot, you get extra options in the test menu (Obj Test, Obj Dump etc.).

		<name>Darius Gaiden - Silver Hawk</name>
		<desc>Taito F3 cart. published 28 years ago:

Darius Gaiden - Silver Hawk (c) 1994 Taito Corporation.

In this game, the third in the Darius series, the player flies an ornate fighter craft called the Silver Hawk. The craft is equipped with two weapons: Missile (forward-firing standard gun) and Bomb (drops from the bottom of the ship). The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the 'Arm' (armor), a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship. Some enemies leave panels behind that can be collected to power-up your shots, missiles or shield.

The graphics and sound are superior to those of the previous Darius games, and the game employs a lot of impressive visual effects; for example, the Silver Hawk warps into a stage dramatically in the fourth-tier stages, and begins to burn on re-entry at the start of the sixth-tier stages.

The bosses are huge and far more complex than those of the previous games, each employing several attack patterns and explode with powerful warping and twisting effects upon their defeat.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Bee Medals: There are bee medals hidden in the whole game. If you shoot where a bee medal is hidden, it starts to blink. Then you will need to use your laser to free it, before you can collect the medal.

* Hits: There is a combo score system for hits within a specific time range. If it takes too long for your next hit, the chain breaks and counting restarts.

* Hidden 1up player: In stage 3 is your one and only chance to pick up a 1up item. It is hidden in the giant red spaceship you will pass later in the stage. To get it, open all 6 side-boxes with your laser, before you destroy the main tower in the center of the ship. You are not allowed to use your smartbomb for these actions. Otherwise the 1up item would not appear in the ruins of the tower afterwards.

* Bomb Stock: If you don't use the smartbombs and keep the stock display at 'maximum' bonus multiplier will be 2x.

* Flower bloom: There are a few places in the game you will meet flowers growing in ruins. If you fly near them they will bloom. This is more than just a joke of the graphic artist. It can reward you with a nice bonus score:
(each) flower blooming: 10 points per 1/60 sec.
+ your shots hit it: 510 points per bullet
+ your laser crosses it: 1'100 points per 1/30 sec.

* Second loop: To access the second (harder) loop thus being able to fight against Hibachi, the 'true' final boss after level 6 boss, you have to complete the first 6 levels with only one credit and meet at least one of these conditions:
- Don't lose more than 2 fighters (lives). 
- Depending on the fighter, have a maximum hit count of at least: 
Type A: 270 hits 
Type B: 300 hits 
Type C: 330 hits 
- At least 50 million points by the end of level 6. 
- Collect all 13 bees in four of the 6 areas using the tactic explained above for 'bee medals'.

		<name>Double Dragon II: The Revenge</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 34 years ago:

Double Dragon II - The Revenge (c) 1988 Technos Japan Corp.

Following his defeat at the end of the original Double Dragon, Willy, the leader of the Black Warriors, retaliates against Billy and Jimmy Lee by murdering their friend, Marian, leaving the brothers with the task to avenge her death.

The sequel to Double Dragon is essentially an upgraded version of the original game, but with with a two-way attacking system similar to one previously used in Technos Japan's 1986 arcade game "Renegade". Many of the attacks and combos from the original "Double Dragon" are retained, as well as new techniques including the invincible Cyclone Kick.

The stages and weapons are redesigned versions of items previously featured in the original game. There are a few new traps such as a bulldozer in the middle of Mission 3 and all of the transition sequences between stages are now done with the character entering the next level via a lift, making it impossible to carry one weapon to the next area.

Most of the enemy characters return from the original Double Dragon, with some given facelifts, but the stage bosses are all new. The enemies are as followed:
* Williams - Has a wilder face and longer hair. He can now run towards the player and do cartwheels. He throws his knives in mid-air and sometimes carry a shovel which he throws towards the player.
* Rowper - Has a beard and eye-patch, but otherwise is more or less identical to his original self. He carries shovels and can sometime pick up large objects.
* Linda - She now has a mohawk and face paint. She can also jump off platforms and do the elbow strike against the player. In addition to the ball and chain, she also carries grenades and knives.
* Oharra - A strongman with a clean-shaved face. Replaces Abobo from the first game and has the same attacks.
* Bolo - A head-swap of Oharra with long hair and beard. Replaces the mohawked head-swap of Abobo from the first game.
* Jeff - Same as his original self, but now carries grenades.
* Burnov - The boss of Mission 1. An obese wrestler whose face is concealed with a mask. He grabs the player and throws similar punches in the face. After dying, he will stand up and yell, disappearing in front of the player and leaving only his clothes. In later encounters, he will revive himself at least once.
* Abore - The boss of Mission 2. A huge suspender-wearing strongman with Terminator-like sunglasses. His slaps and shoulder tackles do massive damage to the player.
* Chin Taimei - The boss of Mission 3. A Chinese martial artists armed with twin kali sticks. In addition to his energy-draining stick combo, he also has a jump kick and sweep kick.
* Willy - The boss of Mission 4. Looks like he does in the original game, but now dresses in red. He still uses the same machine gun from the first game.
* The clone - After defeating Willy, the player will have to fight their character's evil self. This clone has all the techniques the player has, but can also throw energy beams and possess the player's body to drain his energy.

- TRIVIA -

Double Dragon II was released in December 1988.

The yelling sound heard when a coin is inserted comes from an enemy in the game called 'Chin Taimei' (the mission 3 boss that fights using 2 sticks).

Billy and Jimmy trade their original blue and red outfits for black and white respectively in the game. They appear in the game's ending wearing their original colors. Marian wears a yellow dress in the game and her character sprite is slightly redrawn from the original game.

Unlike the original "Double Dragon", the controller configuration for part two were changed from standard punch and kick buttons to less conventional left attack and right attack buttons.

In the same way the original "Double Dragon" paid tribute to the laserdisc game "Road Blaster", Double Dragon II features a similar homage to the laserdisc version of "Cobra Command" ("Thunder Storm" in Japan), which was Yoshihisa Kishimoto's debut game. The helicopter inside the garage at the beginning of the game is the same helicopter from Cobra Command.

Double Dragon II originally began development as a chip upgrade of the first game. Originally only the stages were going to be changed, but there was an incentive to add more features to the game, such as new attacks and enemy characters, which required the game to be developed on a new hardware.

Isaiah Johnson holds the official record for this game with 47,880 points on May 31, 2008.

Meldac / Nippon Crown released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Double Dragon II The Revenge - MECG-28001) on March 3, 1990.

- TRIVIA -

Dead Connection was released in July 1992.

This game was unpopular in Japan because the Mafia theme was not proper to Japanese gamers. A very few boards were released in Japan.

This game seems to take specific inspiration from the the 1987 mobster film 'The Untouchables'. Two of the main characters bear an uncanny resemblance to Kevin Costner and Andy Garcia who both starred in that film.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Bonus points: In Stage 1, 5000 points are hidden in the safe. Hit it to get the bonus points.

* Emeny's bullets can be stopped by the machine gun and the shotgun.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 42 years ago:

Defender (c) 1980 Williams.

Defender is a legendary sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up - the very first of its genre - in which the aim is to pilot a laser-firing spaceship and protect humanoids stranded on the planet's surface from swarms of alien abductors.

A long-range scanner at the top of the screen shows the positions of both the humanoids and the attacking aliens. The ideal strategy is to shoot down the alien ships before they reach the humanoids. If a humanoid is captured, the alien abductor can still be destroyed, but the player must then catch the falling humanoid and return it to the safety of the planet's surface before it falls to its death.

If an alien is allowed to carry its victim to the very top of the screen, the humanoid will mutate, becoming a permanent part of the alien that captured it. This new and deadly mutation will then immediately join in the alien attack.

The challenge becomes more intense as action progresses. Fighter ships and their mines will soon join the abductors. There are also mother ships that must be destroyed; these are particularly difficult as a direct hit smashes the mother ship into a swarming mass of mini-ships that must also be wiped out. Throughout the entire mission, the player must act quickly or face possible destruction by the cosmic baiter, a fast and dangerous enemy.

Players have two escape options to use as a last resort. The first is the 'smart bomb', which destroys all on-screen enemies. The second option is 'hyperspace', which randomly teleports the player's ship to another part of the level. This is highly risky as it may place the player's ship in a position more dangerous than the one it left.

If all humanoids are successfully abducted, the planet will explode in a blinding flash and the waves remaining until the next planet is reached take place in outer space, and consist solely of destroying enemy waves.

- TRIVIA -

According to Defender development lead Eugene Jarvis: The game was shown at AMOA Chicago October 31, 1980 and released a week or two later on November 15, 1980.

Along with Namco's seminal "Pac-Man", Defender shares the title of 'Highest Grossing Video Game of All Time' and to date has earned more than one billion dollars. It's interesting to note that when the now-legendary shoot-em-up was first shown at a 1981 Chicago arcade machine trade show, it was deemed to be a flop due to its high level of difficulty. Arcade industry insiders confidently predicted that both Defender and Pac-Man would be commercial flops and that Namco's "Rally-X" would be the next major arcade success. 

Defender's attract mode for the game was programmed in just five hours. 

Defender was noted for both its superb sound and visual effects and, moreover, for its extremely demanding gameplay. This didn't, however, stop players from accumulating millions of points when playing the game. Just minutes after the opening of the AMOA - an arcade industry trade show - Eugene Jarvis and his team - Defender's creators - were burning new ROMs for the game's display due to the fact they plugged the first burn into the board BACKWARDS and fried them. Due to the intimidating controls, hardly anyone at the show played the game and there were even rumours circulating suggesting that both Pac-Man and Defender would flop and that Namco's Rally-X would be the next big hit. Not only did Defender have the highest number of controls (five buttons, in addition to a two-way joystick) but it was also the first video game to feature an artificial 'world', in that game events occurred OUTSIDE the on-screen viewing area presented to the player. 

Chris Hoffman holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 79,976,975 points on January 1, 1984. 
Bill Jones holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 543,950 points on August 15, 2008. 

Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Star Trek 1981", "Defence Command", "Defense Command", "Zero" (Jeutel), and "Tornado" (Jeutel). 

Defender inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Defender' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. 

A Defender unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Terms of Endearment', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'. 

The official video of the 1982 pop song "Herbergsvater", by Joachim Witt, begins by featuring a Defender unit and contains long scenes of Defender gameplay.

A mini Defender unit appears in the 1983 music video 'Almost Over You' by Sheena Easton. 

MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1983: win the most points by using your Defender ships to protect Humanoids from waves of aliens. A set of chance cards will bring the different aliens (Bombers, Landers and Humanoids) into play. Movement is determined with a spinner. Players can move their defenders and aliens.

- UPDATES -

Defender ROM sets were distinguished by early and later editions. The early edition supported only upright cabinets. In 1981 Williams released a cocktail cabinet version which necessitated extra code to flip the video display and to support a second set of game controls. The editions had some minor differences in the game's attract mode: The early edition gave an erroneous point value of '100' for alien landers; this was corrected to '150' in the later edition. Also, the high score value for player PGD was '14185' in the early edition and '14285' in the later edition. 

Early edition ROM sets: 
* Defender (White Label) 
* Defender (Green Label) 
* Defender (Blue Label) 

Later edition ROM sets: 
* Defender (Red Label)

- SCORING -

Lander: 150 points.
Mutant: 150 points.
Baiter: 200 points.
Bomber: 250 points.
Pod: 1,000 points.
Swarmer: 150 points.
Completely destroying a pod with a smart bomb: 1,150, 1,300, 1,450, 1,600, 1,750, 1,900, or 2,050 points. 
* The chances that a bombed pod will score 1,150, 1,300, or 1,450 points are 1/256 each.

Getting hit by an enemy bullet: 25 points.

Saving a humanoid from a Lander: 500 points.
Depositing a humanoid into the ground: 500 points.
Humanoid landing into the ground safely on his own: 250 points.

Bonus at the end of each wave: 
Wave 1: Humanoids Left X 100.
Wave 2: Humanoids Left X 200.
Wave 3: Humanoids Left X 300.
Wave 4: Humanoids Left X 400.
Wave 5 and above: Humanoids Left X 500.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The enemies that initially appear in each wave are: 
Wave 1: 15 Landers 
Wave 2: 20 Landers, 3 Bombers, and 1 Pod 
Wave 3: 20 Landers, 4 Bombers, and 3 Pods 
Waves 4 and up: 20 Landers, 5 Bombers, and 4 Pods 

* Avoid using hyperspace unless you are about to die. Fighting off attacks, regardless of the number of enemies, will make you a better Defender player. 

* Baiters can usually be overcome by hitting the reverse button twice quickly. They will fly past you and be in range for your fire power. Do NOT try to outrun them as baiters are faster than your ship. 

* Swarmers are easy to defeat. You can hit reverse as soon as they fly past you and fly behind them. They cannot shoot backwards so you can blast away at will. 

* Shooting a Pod will release between 1 and 7 Swarmers. The chances that it will try to release 1, 2, or 3 Swarmers is 1/256 for each. Also, the maximum number of Swarmers allowed in the game is 20. So, for example, if there are 18 Swarmers in the game and a Pod is hit, it can only release a maximum of 2 Swarmers. 

* At higher levels, you will need to play God and even sacrifice some Humanoids (by killing them yourself) to preserve the rest of the planet's population. The planet is too large for you protect and you are sparing the Humanoids from a fate worst than death (mutation). Do not worry, these Humanoids reproduce quickly and overpopulation has always been a constant problem. The planet will be fully populated at the start of every fifth attack wave (configurable). 

* The International Date Line: there are reverse lines for Swarmers and Mutants (AKA the 'International Date Line'). If this line is between you and the type of enemy in question, they will travel the opposite direction around the planet to get you (i.e. they won't cross this line to get to you). If a Mutant, say, is following you and you cross the Mutant reverse line (to the left of the big mountain) it will suddenly reverse direction and go around the other way. The same is true for the Swarmer reverse line (located approximately where your ship starts each wave). This doesn't affect Swarmers that you are following behind. If you're on one side of the line and a Pod is on the other and you shoot it open, the Swarmers will fly away from you and you can get in behind them immediately. The best use of these lines is where there are lots of Swarmers and/or Mutants that you don't want to hassle with. You stay near the line and go back and forth over it to keep the enemy on the other side of the planet. This is especially useful in space and waves that get really hairy. 

* Freeze: you can freeze a Defender machine by picking up all ten Humanoids (on any wave, but Wave 1 is your greatest chance at success), stopping all forward motion of your ship, quieting the screen down (i.e. having no enemies moving around on it) and setting all the Humanoids straight down quickly. This seems to work better were the terrain is very close to the bottom of the screen. Everything will freeze, but you can still move your ship up and down. Thrusting will break the spell, so to speak. If you do pick a spot with shallow terrain, some Humanoids will go thru the bottom of the screen and appear suspended in mid-air near the top. This trick is good to use during marathon games when you've reached Wave 256 and need a breather. 

* Some top players begin each round by shooting all the Humanoids except for one, which they pick up. The planet is too large for you protect and you are sparing the Humanoids from mutation, a fate worse than death. This keeps Mutants from developing, but it also means that the planet explodes if you lose your last Humanoid. The planet is fully repopulated at the start of every fifth attack wave (configurable). This can be considered an advanced trick. 

* Due to a bug in the algorithm that computes extra lives, every scoring activity from 990,000 to 999,975 will earn one extra ship and one extra Smart Bomb. If the player suicides on something or gets shot, one ship is lost, but one ship and one smart bomb are awarded; the net effect on the number of ships is zero. Dying on hyperspace re-entry awards nothing, because this awards no points. For winning N ships from 990,000 to 999,975, the player will have to achieve N x 10000 points after passing 1,000,000 before the game's accounting balances, and ships are awarded properly at 10,000 point intervals again. For example, if a player earns 45 extra lives during this interval, he will have to score another 450,000 points before being awarded another extra life. The player gets to keep surplus ships and bombs and can have super long turns where he may bomb two to three times per wave to get out of dangerous situations. 
* The trick is this: If the player wins 100+ ships between 990,000 and 1,000,000, this causes the game to start awarding extra lives right away again after turning the score over to zero. If the player wins 100 ships, the machine will have to wait 1,000,000 points to begin awarding ships again. However, since 1,000,000 is equivalent to zero, it awards them immediately at 1,010,000. 

* It's possible on a real Defender machine to make the screen color inverted so that all the black space is white while you are playing. It will reset itself when you die and maybe when you use hyperspace. Smart bomb flashes are cool when it's reversed. The trick was to drop a credit in right when you die and the screen flashes white. Somehow the program gets distracted (non-masked interrupt on coin drop?) and the screen stays white. 

* Defender attack waves 'roll over' at Wave 100, which is displayed, after being completed, as Wave 0. The game keeps track of the actual number of waves, even though they are not shown properly. For example, the next wave will be counted as Wave 101, even though it shows being completed as Wave 1. The game will 'roll over' again at Wave 200, which is displayed, after being completed, as Wave 0 as well. 
The next 'roll over' occurs at Wave 256. Upon completion of Wave 255, the next wave is a 'blank' wave, in which no enemies appear, and the wave immediately ends after the player’s ship appears on screen. This level is counted and displayed as Wave 0, and the player is awarded a bonus of humanoids left X 0 points (the bonus for this wave is always 0 points). The next is Wave 1, and the game now plays just as if the player had started a new game, except the player gets to keep his score and all of his bonus ships and smart bombs.

- TRIVIA -

Released in November 1992, Dino Rex was originally planned to be released exclusively to the western market, but in the end the game was released to the Japanese market, too. 

At the beginning of the game development, the original plan was to design a helicopter shoot'em up, but this changed because of the success of the famous "Street Fighter II: The World Warrior".

According to one of the director (Senba Takatsuna), he lacked of Taito's programmers so he recruited new programmers, not familiar with Taito, for this game.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 41 years ago:

Donkey Kong (c) 1981 Nintendo of America, Incorporated.

Export version for North America. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese upright version entry.

- TECHNICAL -

[Blue Upright model] 
The blue uprights (which are the most common), are a very rectangular affair, with quite a lot of artwork. They have orange-ish sticker style side-art (with Mario and Kong on them), with control panel, marquee, and monitor bezel graphics to match. This game does not use a standard arcade monitor. It requires a 'Nintendo Compatible' monitor (a normal monitor will display the picture like that of a photographic negative). This simple little monitor change basically launched the entire Nintendo Vs. Unisystem later on. Because only Donkey Kong series games and Vs. titles would work on these monitors (forcing operators to buy conversion kits for those games instead of a competitors game). 

[Red Upright model] 
The red upright versions are actually "Radar Scope" cabinets that have been factory-converted to Donkey Kong. These are fairly rare and feature slightly different gameplay.

- TRIVIA -

Donkey Kong was released on July 31, 1981 in the USA.

Donkey Kong was to be Nintendo's first big breakthrough into the western - and particularly American - arcade scene. Before Donkey Kong, Nintendo was having difficulty establishing itself in these markets. After the game's massive success Nintendo quickly established their headquarters of Nintendo of America to ensure that the game was being distributed properly. 

Mario was named after Mario Segale, the landlord of Nintendo of America's first warehouse location in Seattle (though it was debated whether this occurred before or well after the game was released). Mario was originally called 'Jumpman'; only the arcade version of Donkey Kong has ever called the hero Jumpman; most home coversions, particularly the NES version, game him the Mario name.

Accounts differ as to how Nintendo of America felt about the game before its release. Many sources claim that they all felt sure it would be an absolute disaster while others say they were more optimistic.

Although Mario is a plumber in later games, his career in Donkey Kong is that of a carpenter. Mario's appearance (and consequently his career) was dictated by the primitive graphics hardware of the time - the only way to have his arms appear 'separate' to his torso was to have them as a different color - hence he wears 'dungarees'. The mustache is present merely to indicate where Mario's mouth is, again due to the low graphics resolution imposed by hardware limitations. Mario wears a hat so his head is distinguishable from the game's black backgrounds. 

About 60,000 units were sold in the US. Oddly, despite it being one of the ten best selling games of the golden age of video games, it never reached #1 on Replay's popularity charts. Instead, it was stuck at #2 behind mega hits "Pac-Man" and "Ms. Pac-Man" - the two best selling games ever. 

Donkey Kong inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Do The Donkey Kong' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. 

A Donkey Kong unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', the 1984 movie 'Gremlins', the 1985 movie 'The Heavenly Kid', and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men' (Season 5, Episode 2 - People Who Love Peepholes). 

MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1982. Save the girl and avoid the barrels and fireballs as in the video game. The gameboard is laid out like the video game's Ramp Stage. 'Can You Battle Donkey Kong and Save the Fair Maiden?'. 

Donkey Kong also spawned a cartoon series of the same name: Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS. Mario was voiced by veteran voice actor Peter Cullen, while Donkey Kong's voice was provided by the late actor/comedian Soupy Sales (1926-2009). 

Michael Jackson used to own this game (Blue Upright model). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.

- UPDATES -

The original Japanese version had all four stages displayed in their original, logical order 1-2-3-4.
For this US version, they changed it to match the 'How High Can You Try/Get?' theme, with the stage order as follows: 
L-01: 1-4 
L-02: 1-3-4 
L-03: 1-2-3-4 (as in all levels of the Japanese version) 
L-04: 1-2-1-3-4 
L-05: 1-2-1-3-1-4 
L-06 through L-21 all remain the same as L-05 
L-22: 1 (Kill screen).

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 24 years ago:

Dead or Alive ++ (c) 1998 Tecmo, Limited.

An update of the 1996 original, this game run on the ZN-1 architecture, hardware based the Sony Playstation.

Upon its initial release, the now-respected series drew attention and notoriety as much for the gravity-defying 'bouncing breasts' of its female protagonists as for its solid, inventive gameplay.

- TECHNICAL -

Main CPU: SPU (@ 16.9344 Mhz)
Sound Chips: SPU (@ 16.9344 Mhz)

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 6

- TRIVIA -

Dead or Alive ++ was released on October 16, 1998.

Presented by Team Ninja (see 'Staff' section for more information).

This game runs on Sony Playstation-based hardware while the original Dead or Alive runs on the more powerful Sega Model 2 hardware. Consequently, this game uses 3-D arenas surrounded by 2D backdrops while the original Dead or Alive uses a fully 3-D environment rendered in real time. However, this game compensates with smoother, rounder character models and better lighting effects.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Raidou: complete a game playing as Kasumi in Tournament Mode and defeating Raidou at stage 8, then in the name entry screen input the word 'SIAWASE?'. Raidou appears now in the character select screen.

		<name>Do! Run Run</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game kit published 38 years ago:

Do! Run Run (c) 1984 Universal.

A superb final entry into the "Mr Do!" series (not counting the Neo Geo-based "Neo Mr. Do", which was merely a remake of the first game in the series), "Do! Run Run" takes its inspiration from Namco's "Pac-Man".

As in his previous games, Mr Do! must once again collect coloured dots and/or fruit while avoiding or killing a number of enemies. For the fourth Mr Do! outing, Universal ditched the sideways viewpoint of the series' previous games and switched to an overhead perspective. This allowed the game to give an impression of 'depth', with slopes and steps affecting Mr Do!'s mobility and speed.

Mr. Do. has two items at his disposal with which he can kill the his enemies. The first is the 'Powerball', which featured in the original 'Mr. Do!' but was dropped from the first two sequels. The Powerball can be shot directly at an enemy to kill it instantly.

The second offensive option is provided in the form of the large wooden logs that litter the levels. These work in the same way as the apples did in the original game, and can be pushed free of their supporting struts, causing them to roll down the screen and kill everything in their path, including Mr. Do. himself if he strays too near.

As Mr Do! moves around a screen, he trails a line behind him. Players can join the two ends of the line up to form a rectangle (in a similar fashion to Taito's 1981 classic, "Qix") which will change any dots within the rectangle into cherries. A second rectangle can be drawn around the cherries which in turn will change them into apples. This can be repeated twice more, changing apples into lemons, and lemons into pineapples. The better the fruit, the more bonus points Mr Do! will earn when he collects them.

- TRIVIA -

Do! Run Run was released in November 1984 in the USA.

Because of the video game crash of 1983, Universal decided to release their final Mr. Do! game as a conversion kit only, because the market for dedicated cabinets had all but dried up at this point (but it was a full kit that would fit any cabinet, not just a kit for other Mr. Do! games). This kit is fairly rare, and is almost impossible to find today. The kit contained a new PCB and new graphics for the machine, the graphics were purple themed, and the marquee had a 'DO! Run Run' logo superimposed over a purple geometric landscape with a blue line running randomly about it.

Bootleggers ported this title to the very similar "Mr. Do's Castle" hardware, although that version is fairly rare.

This game was re-released in Japan only in 1987 as "Super Pierrot" with slightly different mazes.

Adam Mastromarino of Bristol, England holds the official record for this game with 1605100 points on September 16, 1984.

- SCORING -

Eating a dot: 10 points.
Eating a cherry: 20 points.
Eating a cake: 40 points.
Eating a lemon: 80 points.
Eating a pineapple: 160 points.
Killing a monster/letter with the snowball: 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 or 3000 points depending on the number of bounces before the snowballs makes contact.
Killing a monster with a log: 1000 points.
Killing multiple monsters with a log: 1500 points for the second monster and an incremental 500 points for each monster thereafter (2000, 2500 etc.)
Killing 5 monsters at once: 10000 points.
Collecting the free credit diamond: 8000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* You can kill a baddie with your ball or by log-rolling him. Save the ball for emergencies and use the logs as much as possible.

* It takes 16 dots to regain your ball after you throw it.

* Each bounce of your ball against a wall increases the points you can get if it hits a baddie, up to 3000 pts max. Somewhere on every board, is hidden a 'letter', that when surrounded by your path, will bring out the 'E-X-T-R-A' guy if you step on it.  It changes as time passes so use this to get the letters you need to come out so you can spell extra as fast as possible.

* The extra guy will also come out if you kill or log-roll enough baddies. If you use the hidden letter and a log, you should be able to get 2 EXTRA letters per level. This will earn you more free Mr. Do!s as fast as possible because the higher levels will get tough.

* Stepping on an EXTRA letter will not only bring out the EXTRA guy and his entourage, but the baddies on the level will slow down to half speed. This makes it easy to avoid them while you lure the EXTRA and his ghosts under a log. 

* Use the logs as much as possible. They kill the most guys with a single log to get the most points. If you can lure 3 or 4 baddies into the path of a log, they will not move out of the way once the log is pushed and you kill them easily. Walking under a log knocks out the post holding them up so get out of the way if you do that. You do not have to push the log from above to get it moving.

* A log will also roll if it is hit by a flaming/flying snake/dragon. Be aware of this so you don't get crushed!

* A level ends once you get all the baddies (or get all the dots). Use this to your advantage. If a log is going to run over the last baddie, let it run into you too. If all the baddies are in line with a log, you can start it rolling, let it roll you and then the baddies will freeze in place for the log to roll them too. Your life will be restored at the end of the level if you get all the baddies!

* Mr. Do! slows down going up a step and speeds up when going down them. Use this to your advantage if you are being chased. The baddies don't speed up going downhill so you have the advantage.

* Don't waste your time gathering dots or surrounding them to get pineapples. There are more points in log-rolling and multi-bounce hits of your ball. Collect dots only to restore your ball or expose the EXTRA letter. You should be able to get about 20000 points per level using the above techniques.

* Try to make concentric circle patterns from the outermost edge in, 'eating' the outermost cherries, dots or whatever each time. This will allow you to get a ton of pineapples, which score the most, and will get you a good score in early stages before it gets difficult.

Double Dragon (c) 1995 Technos.

A head-to-head fighting game based on the 1994 Double Dragon movie, the game features a roster selectable which consists of "Double Dragon" alumni Billy, Jimmy, Marian, Abobo and Burnov, as well as 5 original characters as they enter a martial arts tournament to take out evil crime lord of Bloody Town, Koga Shuko. Unique features in the game includes destructible environments and a super move meter which fills out based on how much energy the player has left, giving weaker fighters a handicap. After defeating the default 10 fighters, the player faces Shuko's bodyguard, Duke, before fighting Shuko himself.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-082

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 4
=&gt; [A] Light Attack [B] Medium Attack [C] Hard Attack [D] Extra Attack

- TRIVIA -

Released in February 1995. Double Dragon was Technos' first game for the Neo-Geo hardware. This game was based on the movie 'Double Dragon', which was, in turn, based on the 'Double Dragon series' of games.

The game features a combo counter like many fighting games, however this one is not always very accurate since it registers Cheng Fu's Super Dragon Kick technique (Forward Dragon Punch motion + 2 buttons with the charge meter filled) as a single hit! The original Double Dragon logo can be seen in the large white boat on Cheng Fu's stage!

Billy, Jimmy, Marian and Abobo are the only characters from the original 1987 "Double Dragon" game who were featured in both: the movie and this game. Billy and Jimmy have the ability to transform into more powerful counterparts like they did in the end of the movie, while Abobo turns into his mutated form for a brief moment when he does his 'Grow 'n Throw' super move. Marian is depicted as a female gang leader, much like her movie counterpart. Burnov was the first stage boss in "Double Dragon II - The Revenge", while Duke was the final boss in the Super NES game "Super Double Dragon", although neither character were in the movie. Koga Shuko, the game's final boss, was an original character from the film.

April Simmonds holds the official record for this game with 96,700 points on April 21, 2007.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Double Dragon - G.S.M 1500 - PCCB-00175) on March 17, 1995.

- UPDATES -

MVS (arcade) vs. Home (neo-geo) differences:
- Arcade: If you beat the game without losing a round you'll see a drawing of each character posing while the credits roll. If you beat using a continue you just see the credits rolling on the screen in one of the monitors that fell on the last boss.
- Home: Regardless if you use continues or not you will only get the credits that roll on the big monitor screen.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play As Duke / As Koga Shuko: Go to the character selection screen and put the cursor on Billy, then Marian, then Chung Fu, then Jimmy for 3 seconds each. If done correctly you will hear the word 'Bingo!'.

* Alternate Costume Colors: Press B, C or D when selecting a fighter.

Elevator Action Returns (c) 1995 Taito.

Elevator Action Returns is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up for one or two players who each take on the role of a special task force operative and must foil a terrorist group that has planted nuclear bombs in various facilities. Players must also obtain the secret intelligence data scattered throughout each facility in order to disarm the bombs. 

The objective of the game is to enter all of the red-coloured doors in each stage, then proceed to the exit. If players miss one of the red doors, they will be unable to progress beyond a certain point. There are also blue-coloured doors and entering these will award the player a special item, these include health refills, special firearms, sub-weapons and bonus points.

The player's default weapon is a semi-automatic handgun with unlimited ammunition but more powerful weapons - either a missile launcher or machine gun - can be found. These have limited ammunition, however and if the ammo for either weapon runs out, players will revert to their default weapon. Extra ammunition for these weapons can occasionally be found, however. 

It's possible to conserve ammo by attacking an enemy at close range, triggering a melee attack rather than firing a weapon. When an enemy is defeated with a close-range attack, the amount of points awarded is doubled. Players can also attack the enemy with a jumping attack or can throw an explosive (which serves as the character's sub-weapon). Explosives are thrown by pressing the SHOOT and JUMP buttons simultaneously while standing or crouching and the type of explosive used depends on which character the player is using. 

Objects within the environment can also be used to fight enemies. Elevators can be used to crush enemies standing above or below one. There are also oil drums that can be exploded with gunfire, they will then leave a trail of fire that will burn any enemies that come into contact with it. During the latter half of the game, players will also have to deal with electric barriers that will harm both players and enemies alike.

Each player character has a health gauge that shows the amount of damage they have sustained and when the gauge reaches zero, the player will lose a life. Players can choose to play as one of three different characters:

* Kart Bradfield - The fastest and most agile of the group. His default gun is a Glock 18, which he can upgrade to either an AK-47 assault rifle or an MM-1 grenade launcher. His sub-weapons are hand grenades that explode and clear the whole floor. He is the slowest shooter of the three when using his default weapon.

* Edie Burret - The fastest shooter of the three. Her default gun is a Beretta M92F, which can she can upgrade to either an MP5K sub-machine gun or an ARWEN 37 launcher. Her sub-weapons are incendiary grenades that produce a pool of flame, this lasts a short while and kills almost all enemies that come into contact with it. She has the lowest health of all characters but fires her default gun faster than the others.

* Jad the Taff - The strongest and most durable of the three. His default gun is a Desert Eagle, which he can upgrade to either an M60 machine gun or an 80mm recoil-less rifle. His sub-weapons are sensor bombs that explode in fragments whenever an enemy comes within range. He has the most health of all the characters but is the slowest walker. 

Elevator Action Returns consists of six stages: a skyscraper, an airport, an underground arcade, a sewer, an underwater oil plant and a missile base.

Enduro Racer (c) 1986 Sega.

Enduro Racer is an off-road racing game in which players ride a dirt bike across five extremely hilly and twisting courses. Each course is littered with logs, rocks, trees and rival racers that must be either jumped over or avoided.

Jumps can only be performed at specific locations on each track. These locations feature a dirt ramp that spreads across the width of the track. Players must have the bike in the 'wheelie' position when the ramp is struck, the bike will then be launched into the air. If the bike is not in a wheelie position when the ramps are struck, the bike will still clear the ramp, but will land front-wheel first and crash.

Enduro Racer is perhaps best remembered for its 'Wheelie' feature, which required the player to physically lift the cabinet's handlebars to raise the front wheel of the game's on-screen counterpart.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 39 years ago:

Exerion (c) 1983 Jaleco Company, Ltd [Japan Leisure].

Exerion is a vertical shooter that is operated with an 8 direction joystick and two fire buttons. The game's biggest features are the parallax scrolling which occurs in the background, and the sensation of inertia that is applied to the motion of the ship. The ship is equipped with two kinds of weapons. You can fire the dual shot gun which can only release one pair of shots on the screen at a time, but has an unlimited supply, by tapping the first fire button. The single shot gun can fire a rapid stream of shots on the screen at one time by holding the second fire button down, but it is limited in ammo according to the number of charges indicated on the bottom. Each weapon is best used in different situations, in order to defeat the enemies which come flying down from the top part of the screen.

Due to the inertia of the ship, you must input any reverse in direction much sooner in order to cancel the ships momentum. This was not a common feature for similar games that came out around the same time, so it distinguished Exerion from other shooters. Because the Famicom conversion was played on a horizontal screen, the enemies appeared much closer to the player's ship, which changes the feel of the game since you have to react to the enemies' location much sooner.

- TRIVIA -

Exerion was released in November 1983.

Licensed to Taito for US distribution.

A part of this game was later used in the fifth stage of "The Game Paradise". The stage is called '23bit CPU captured by 8bit CPU'.

A bug can occurs resulting a return to the titlescreen...

Another bug is know during the challenge stage: if you shoot all 40 aliens you normally get a bonus charge of 60. Sometimes a red hydra comes out during this stage. If you shoot it and all 40 aliens, you get a total of 41. The game seems to fail the test of 'hits=40' and only gives you a bonus charge of 41.

Giorgio Bonetti holds the official record for this game with 3,679,100 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Hint:
To get a high score, if you do not miss any shots your bonus score will keep on doubling to 10,000 then reset to 000. When at 10,000 miss a shot then bonus score will revert to 5,000.

* Hint:
When fire from the double shot (slower) weapon hits an enemy, it re-charges the faster single shot weapon. To keep the single shot re-charged it is possible to fire both weapons at once by tapping both fire buttons, maintaining charge, giving a higher rate of fire and more chance of hitting enemies.

Eyes (c) 1982 Rock-Ola Mfg. Corp.

The player controls a hat-wearing eyeball in a maze. As in Pac-Man, the goal is to collect all of the dots to advance to next level, but in Eyes you shoot the dots rather than eat them. Computer-controlled eyes chase and shoot at the player. Shooting a computer eye gives points and removes it from the level, but it will reappear a short time later. Being shot by a computer eye is fatal.

As the game progresses, more computer eyes are added to levels and they take less time to shoot at the player. They also move faster.

Garou Densetsu Special was released in September 1993 in Japan.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf Special'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Fatal Fury Special'.

Things that changed in this particular game:
* The combo system has been improved, hit damage has been lessened &amp; the game speed has been increased.

Is Kim Kaphwan trying to replace Superman? You'll see for yourself when you spot him flying in Big Bear's &amp; Terry Bogard's stages!

- UPDATES -

MVS (arcade) vs. Home (neo-geo) differences:
- Home: After the credits you will see all the characters grouped together and it will say to try a harder difficulty. If you beat it in the hardest difficulty it will say 'Perfect! It's a knockout, Superman!'.
- Home: If playing on the hardest difficulty and you fought Ryo Sakazaki, you will see all the characters moving around him in a circle while he, for some reason, is crying.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Fight against Ryo Sakazaki: Beat the game without losing a single round (you can lose continues, but not rounds). You'll face against "Art of Fighting"'s main character Ryo Sakazaki as a powerful extra end boss!

* Beat the game without using a single continue and after the credits you will see every character performing a special move, their portraits and giving a quote.

- TRIVIA -

Garou Densetsu was released in November 1991 in Japan.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf - Battle of Destiny'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Fatal Fury - King of Fighters'. 

Originally called 'Real Bout', SNK opted to change the title to 'Fatal Fury'. You can see the game's original title on the banner of a store in the background of Hwa Jai's stage ('Real Bout Shop').

According to the USA flyer, the name of the game is 'Fatal Fury - The Battle of Fury'. On the ingame titlescreen, however, it's called 'Fatal Fury - King of Fighters'.

The official name of the tournament is 'The King of Fighters'. This can be verified if you look closely the promo poster seen in the name rankings. Later SNK would use this name for a popular game series of its own.

The music in a 2-player battle is taken from the first stage of "Street Smart".

This is the very first game that featured one of SNK's most famous fighters: Terry Bogard! Over the years, Terry Bogard has appeared in many games, usually in his familiar jacket with a star on his back and a cap on his head. However, what is on his cap is different (probably because he tosses so many of them, but that's a different story). Some games have him wear a blank cap, some have his cap say 'Running Wild', some have the Neo-Geo logo on them, but the commonly accepted cap is the one that says 'Fatal Fury' on it.

Terry Bogard appears in "Quiz King of Fighters" as selectable character.

This game was such a hit in Japan that an animated movie was released featuring character designs by Masami Ohbari. This movie's plot is fairly true to the game's main plot and all the characters in the game are featured. The movie was released on the USA by courtesy of Viz Video, a division of Viz Comics.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu, Last Resort - PCCB-00087) on 21/05/1992.

- UPDATES -

The Japanese version features quite different move list sets for the three main characters (In the Fatal Fury sequels as well as the King of Fighters, Terry, Andy &amp; Joe's move list sets are clearly based on the Japanese release of this particular game). All other versions feature very simplified joystick commands for each move.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

As the game sometimes says on the continuation screen, you can tell some opponents' weak points by watching their moves carefully, which can help you figure out how to beat them. Here are a few examples:

-- If you've knocked down an opponent, you can damage them some more by charging at them with a 'dash attack' just as they're getting up, until they've been fully beaten. This may work best when playing with Andy Bogard.

-- When Tung Fu Rue changes into a hefty beast Incredible Hulk-style, he'll be briefly intangible as he beats his chest. Wait until the right moment and then dash at him (or, if you're playing with Joe Higashi, you can use his rapid punch). He won't actually fall on the ground in this form, but he'll be easier to beat until he turns back to normal as long as you can keep dash-attacking him.

-- When you're facing Hwa Jai, he'll be thrown a bottle of some kind of drink by an agent of Geese standing within the crowd of spectators, and after drinking it (during which time he'll be briefly intangible too), that's when he really lets loose with damaging attacks. If you feel Hwa Jai's too hard to deal with this way, you can try to cause him damage by a small amount, and if your lifebar is still higher than his, you can then step back on defense. He'll try hitting you with standard punches and kicks, but will not throw you, and this way, you can keep on the defensive until the timer runs out, winning simply by having more life energy left than he does.

-- When facing Billy Kane, if his pole falls away (he can either throw it at you or it can fall when he's thrown to the ground), he'll go on the defensive until another agent of Geese's tosses him another pole from within the crowd on the bridge. When he jumps up to grab hold of it, that's when you can move in and try to grab and throw him to the ground, or ram him with a dash attack.

Finally, when facing Geese Howard in the showdown match, you can move towards him as the round begins and then grab and throw him to the ground, then, by timing your attacks correctly, you can grab him in a body slam again when he gets up, eventually beating him by body-slamming him repeatedly. It's a tricky strategy, but it can work!

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.

- TRIVIA -

Garou Densetsu 2 was released in December 1992 in Japan.

The title of the translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf 2 - The New Battle'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Fatal Fury 2'. According to the USA flyer, the name of the game is 'Fatal Fury 2 - The Sultan of Slugs Battle Royale'.

Things that changed in this sequel:
* This game allows you to switch between the background &amp; foreground planes at will (in the first game, you could only switch planes if the CPU was on a different battle plane!).
* The game ditches the previous game's 3 button setup (punch, kick &amp; throw) in favor of a new 4 button setup (light &amp; heavy punches &amp; kicks). This is apparently one of the very first Neo-Geo fighters to use this now common button setup.
* This game introduces the use of Desperation Moves (highly damaging techniques that can only be used when the life-bar is flashing red). This game as well as "Art of Fighting" were the first fighting games to introduce these moves.
* Newcomers in the game are: Mai Shiranui, Cheng Sinzan, Kim Kaphwan, Jubei Yamada, Big Bear (aka Raiden), Axel Hawk, Lawrence Blood &amp; Wolfgang Krauser. Richard Meyer, Michael Max, Tung Fu Rue, Duck King, Hwa Jai &amp; Geese Howard were left out! (although some of them make some cameos during some of the game's cut-scenes!).

Just as the first game introduced the famed Terry Bogard, this game features SNK's most popular fighter lady: Mai Shiranui!:). Mai appears in "Quiz King of Fighters" as selectable character.

The Hungry Wolf is a reference to Terry Bogard, the main character in Fatal Fury. Terry, Andy and Joe (and to a lesser extent, Mai and Mary) are referred to as the Lone Wolves.

Keeping the tradition of the first game, an animated movie based on this game was released in Japan featuring character designs by Masami Ohbari. The movie was also released in the USA by Viz Video, a division of Viz Comics. After the second Fatal Fury movie was released, a third movie followed (which predated "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory"). It follows the adventures of the Lonely Wolves (Terry, Andy, Joe and Mai) as they attempt to prevent a power-hungry man from claiming all the parts of the legendary Armor of Mars.

When a player wins a match in a single player game, the post match screen shows people watching the tournament inside the Pao Pao Cafe from the first game, "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters".

Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu 2 - PCCB-00111) on 19/02/1993.

Reviews:
[FR] March 1993 - Consoles + No. 18: 97/100 (AES version)

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* You can only see any character's ending if you beat the game with a single credit used (no continues or 2-Player matches are allowed)

* Just like the first game, it's possible to use the strategy of dashing at your opponents just as they're getting up in order to damage them repeatedly.

* Billy Kane, Axel Hawk and Lawrence Blood all have stages that use a single plane, with the 'second' plane having objects on it that can injure players if they're knocked against them (all three of these bosses have ways of throwing their opponents into the background). You can knock the bosses into the background too by standing close to them while they're dazed and then hitting them with a good hard kick or punch.

餓狼伝説3 遥かなる闘い (c) 1995 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].
(Garou Densetsu 3 - Harukanaru Tatakai)

During a trip to Southtown to attend the inauguration of a new branch of Pao Pao Cafe by former street fighter Richard Meyer, the lone wolves (Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi &amp; Mai Shiranui) are unwillingly caught in the middle of a desperate search for the Shiranui Scrolls and the mysterious fighters that are after them! The game features a new graphic style, 2 different background planes to fight, a grade system that shows how well you perform in battle, lots of hidden moves &amp; combos, as well as multiple endings based on your performance. The answers shall only be uncovered by a long &amp; fierce battle, are you up to it?

- TRIVIA -

Garou Densetsu 3 was released in March 1995 in Japan.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf 3 - The Distant Battle'.

Garou Densetsu 3 overtly refers to itself by its overseas name of 'Fatal Fury 3' throughout the game.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory'.

Things that changed in this particular game:
* The game introduces a deeper plane change system which proved to be somewhat clunky &amp; difficult to use due to the tricky commands used to move between planes.
* Chain combos are introduced to add even more depth to each character's fighting style. 
* Throws are harder to use since these are slow and throw-miss animations were added.
* Newcomers in the game are Bob Wilson, Blue Mary, Franco Bash, Hon Fu, Sokaku Mochizuki, Ryuji Yamazaki, Jin Chonshu &amp; Jin Chonrei.

Hon Fu's goofy martial artist routine &amp; easygoing personality make him SNK's hilarious homage to Jackie Chan. Definitely not a Bruce Lee clone!:)

Kyo Kusanagi &amp; Sie Kensou make a cameo in Pao Pao Cafe!

Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu 3 - PCCB-00179) on April 21, 1995.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Reach and beat Jin Chonshu with a fighting grade above "A" and you'll fight a hidden last boss, her brother, Jin Chonrei.

One of the coolest things of this game is the fact that you can alter some backgrounds objects by slamming opponents against them. For example, you can knock away the training dummy in Joe's stage if you send an opponent flying towards it. Experiment on various stages to find more surprises!

Note: If the game is set on the USA, ASIA or EUROPE bios, the game will reset after defeating Jin Chonrei and you won't get to see the ending, however if the game is set on the JAPAN bios it will work just fine!

		<name>Fighter's History</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 29 years ago:

Fighter's History (c) 1993 Data East Corporation.

Fighter's History is the first attempt of Data East to enter in competition with Capcom and its omnipresent Street Fighter II. Because the many similarities shared by the game with the Capcom masterpiece (like the character select screen, the vs and winner/loser screens, the controls and the design and moves of some characters), Fighter's History was at least simply stamped by most of the  players like another SFII clone, and in this way remained ignored and obscured to the mass audience.

Although time after, the many beat'em up fans learnt to appreciate this maybe too underestimated fighting game, especially for its combo system, quite simple to execute even for those players not so able with timing and button pressing, and for its fast gameplay: at this purpose most of the contribution was made by the updated version released in 1994, Fighter's History Dynamite (known as Karnov's Revenge in USA and Europe) that made the gameplay more polished. Despite this at least Fighter's History never reached that great success that maybe Data East still tried to achieve.

Players choose one of 9 international fighters and battle to be the best in the world. Every character has his ending sequence and his own stage. There are also two not-selectable bosses to challenge for reach the end, and the last one of them is real surprising!

- TRIVIA -

Fighter's History was released in March 1993.

At the time of Fighter's History's release, Capcom U.S.A. sued Data East Corp. over Fighter's History due to what Capcom U.S.A. felt were infrigements on their Street Fighter II property. Capcom U.S.A. lost the case on grounds that the copied elements were scenes a faire and thus excluded from copyright. Data East Corp.'s largest objection in court was that their 1984 arcade game Karate Champ was the true originator of the competitive fighting game genre, which predated the original Street Fighter by three years. 

This is one of the rare Japanese-made fighting games where the characters yell out the names of their moves in their native language. Most Japanese-made fighting games, including "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", have the Asian characters (usually comprised of East Asians) speak Japanese while all the other characters speak English or Japanese, regardless of their nationality. 

Also, every character has several winning quotes displayed in the win/lose screen: these changes depending the defeated opponent.

Another particular feature of the Fighter's History saga is the presence of characters of other Data East games in the cast of the game: in fact, the final boss of Fighter's History and Fighter's History Dynamite is actually Karnov, the hero of the homonimous platform game of Data East released in 1987. While in Fighter's History - Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!! (released only for Super Famicom in Japan) the final boss is even Chelnov, the hero of Chelnov - Atomic Runner (1988) still released by Data East.

About Ryoko: This character seems somehow inspired by Ryoko Tamura, famous female judo champion that started her judo career at the age of 16 (the same age of Ryoko on the game) on the Barcelona Olympics on 1992, and winner of several medals and prizes in every judo contests all over the world. Other inspiration for Ryoko could be from the heroine of the manga "Yawara", based on the story of a young female judoka. There is also another curious thing to know about Ryoko: in the same year (1993), ADK released World Heroes 2, sequel of the previous World Heroes released in 1992, and inside his innovative character rooster appeared a new female fighter named Ryoko, that is very similar to the one of Fighter's History, especially in the physical appearance (the only difference is the colour of her Kimono: white for Ryoko of Fighter's History, light blue for Ryoko of World Heroes 2; also, Ryoko of Fighter's History has a red headband, while Ryoko of World Heroes 2 does not), but however the moves of the two characters are totally different, even if the fighting style is judo for both of them. At least the two "Ryokos" are admittedly inspired by the real Ryoko Tamura as well.

Both Ryoko and Jean's endings mention the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.

Different to Street Fighter II, some stages of Fighter's History show locations actually existing in the world:
* The stage of Ray (USA) takes place in front the gates of the White House, that is clearly visible in the middle of the screen.
* The stage of Marstorius (Italy) takes place in front the 'Fontana di Trevi' of Rome, one of the most famous fountains of the world. The fountain is not only celebrated for its excellent water but for the legend that whoever drinks it or throws a coin in the fountain, will assure his return to Rome.

Mizoguchi makes a cameo in Joe &amp; Mac Returns (1994) as an enemy character. He was a secret character in the Sega Saturn and Playstation versions of Outlaws of the Lost Dynasty, and was joined by Yungmie for the Saturn exclusive update to that game, Fuunsaiki. Also Mizoguchi later appeared as a selectable character in the Sony PlayStation 2 game "KOF - Maximum Impact Regulation A" to promote the Japanese-exclusive cell phone game Garou Densetsu vs. Fighter's History Dynamite, and as a hidden character in Kenka Bancho: Badass Rumble.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Fighter's History - G.S.M. 1500 Series - PCCB 00123) on June 18, 1993.

A bootleg of this game, titled 'The History of Martial Arts' (199?) was made by an unknown producer.

A Fighter's History unit appears in the 1998 movie 'The Replacement Killers'.

- UPDATES -

The US version has the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Weak Points: one of the features of the Fighter's History gameplay is the introduction of the weak points for all the characters of the game: these weak points consists basically in a single part of the suit of every character, that begin to flash while taking some strong hits: after the last strong hit making fly away the weak point, the character will get dizzy. In this way every character can get dizzy once time for round, and pop off the weak point of the opponent will become an essential strategy during the fight. In the next round, weak points are restored for both players.

These are the weak points for every character of the game:
Ray: lightning bolt (on the shirt)
Feilin: breastplate 
Ryoko: headband
Matlok: headgear
Samchay: armband
Lee: knees (some parts of the pants near the knees)
Mizoguchi: headband
Jean: leg band
Marstorius: leg warmers
Clown: mask
Karnov: hat

		<name>Frogger</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 41 years ago:

Frogger (c) 1981 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

Frogger is a one or two-player game in which players must overcome a number of hazards to safely guide the green amphibian from the bottom of the screen to one of five home bases situated at the top of the screen.

The lower half of the screen consists of a bi-directional flow of traffic moving across five lanes. To navigate across the road safely, Frogger's hops must be timed to avoid the vehicles, which include buses, civilian traffic and racing cars, with different vehicle types moving at different speeds. As well as being able to hop vertically, Frogger can also move left and right, allowing him to move with the flow of traffic. 

The upper half of the screen consists of a fast-flowing river populated with logs, crocodiles and turtles. Frogger will drown if he has any contact with the water and these act as platforms onto which Frogger can hop. He must be careful to avoid contact with crocodiles' snapping jaws, however and some of the turtles will periodically dive below the water's surface, drowning Frogger. Frogger will also die if he is on a log, turtle or crocodile when it reaches the edge of the screen.

On the logs of the river section a female frog will occasionally appear and bonus points are awarded if Frogger successfully escorts her safely home. A fly also appears randomly in a home base and bonus points are awarded if Frogger enters the base when the fly is present. Conversely, a crocodile may also appear in a home base and a life is lost if Frogger enters the base while the crocodile is present.

A round is completed once five frogs have been guided safely home, after which the next round begins with an increased level of difficulty. This includes faster-moving vehicles on the road section and new, deadly hazards on the river section, including crocodiles, otters and snakes.

- TRIVIA -

Frogger was released by Konami in June 1981 in Japan; it became a runaway hit. 

1981 was a big year in video games. A lot of companies were putting some pretty popular games on the market and it created a very competitive atmosphere as to what company was putting out the most popular ones. In addition, 1981 continued on the trend of the 'cute' type games such as "Ms. Pac-Man", "Qix", and a host of Pac-Man clones. Konami was already becoming a force to be reckoned with in the video gaming world. With such hits as "Space War", "Scramble", and "Super Cobra", Konami was making its mark. 

The sound that can be heard when a coin is inserted into the machine was sampled by producer Richard X for the Sugababes' song, 'Freak Like Me' (and is the very first sound on the track). 

Frogger has numerous bugs, although many of these are not immediately apparent to the average player: 
1. Sections of the music will occasionally cut out, although the main melody will continue to play. 
2. On occasion, Frogger displays a somewhat haphazard approach to collision detection. One side effect of this is that the player can sometimes make a perfectly legal and safe jump and still lose a life. Another side effect of this is that the player can jump up onto the first row of turtles, and then immediately jump back. This will place the player 'off the grid', and it is now possible to jump right off the side of the screen, leading to a loss of life. 
3. There are several other odd jumps that can be made as well. Firstly, the player can 'hang off' the left side of a turtle, but attempting to do the same on the right side results in death. If the player jumps onto a home base with an alligator (and the 'gator vanishes after you jump, but before the player lands), Frogger will be killed, but he will ALSO make it home. Finally, left and right jumps on the top row of logs are sometimes much slower than usual - this is more likely to occur after previously eating a fly. 
4. Another in-game bug is that the lady frog will sometimes be invisible, but will flash red when the player jumps onto the spot where she is. 

Mark Robichek holds the official record for this game with 442,330 points. 

A Frogger unit appears in the 1999 movie 'Magnolia' and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men'; Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes). 

Frogger inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Froggy's Lament' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. 

The TV show, Seinfeld, has an episode named 'The Frogger'. George and Jerry are in Mario's Pizza which is closing down, and they find a Frogger game still there. They realize that the high score of 860,630 points has George's initials GLC [George Louis Costanza]. They reminisce about the night it happened: "I was unstoppable!... Just the right amount of grease on the joystick". George decides to buy the Frogger machine to immortalize his high score, but Jerry informs him that unplugging the game will erase all of the scores. Later, George tries in vain to call an electrician to help: "I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?". Kramer suggests an electrician who can help. George says, "Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me". George assembles a team and hatches a plan to salvage the game. But when he arrives, he finds the team playing the game, which has only three minutes of battery life left. They can't get it back in the closed pizzeria, but there is an open pharmacy across the street where it could be plugged in. George decides to push the machine across the highway, and an overhead shot of this feat looks much like the Frogger game itself, and the music from the game is played. At the end, George is unable to push the game onto the sidewalk and it gets destroyed by an oncoming truck. 

MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) the same year, 'One Wrong Leap Will Get You Squished And Splattered': in this version of the game, 2 players face off, each with their own army of frogs, logs, and automobiles. Each turn, a player spends his movement points either moving his frogs toward their goal (the other side of the board), or moving logs and cars in an attempt to block or squash the other player's frogs. Complete with 'bonus points' for landing on flies, this is actually a pretty faithful interpretation of the video-game, but far too simple to have any long-lasting interest. More of a curiosity for video game enthusiasts than anything. 

Frogger also spawned a cartoon series of the same name: Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced By Joe Ruby, Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS. 

Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.

The main character appears on the 2012 animation movie "Wreck-It Ralph" from Walt Disney Animation Studios.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your frog will start at the bottom of the screen. You will have 60 seconds to move your frog up 10 spaces and successfully put it in one of the homes. If you are successful, then you will try to put another frog in another home and so on until you fill up all five homes with frogs. When you do this, you progress to the next level. 

* Note the traffic flow of the two parts. The cars travel on the roadway while the logs, turtles, crocodiles, etc. travel on the water lanes in the following direction: 
a) Lanes #1, #3, and #5 go from right to left. 
b) Lanes #2 and #4 go from left to right. 

* First, you must cross the highway. You will become roadkill if a vehicle hits you or you hit a vehicle. Try to find 'lanes' in between the vehicles. You must plan for gaps to form in the first three lanes so you don't become trapped. The vehicles in the first three lanes move slowly enough that you can jump side to side with reasonable safety. 

* Lane #4 is the dangerous lane. Depending on how much time you are taking, the cars may pick up speed even though it shows slow on the chart. Keep this in mind when you are moving your frog. 

* At level 3, a snake will either be in the median or on the log in water lane #3. The snake is deadly to your frog and you cannot hop over it. 

* The turtles are pretty easy to navigate over in water lanes #1 and #4. Be wary of the diving turtles and only use them as a quick bypass to a more solid footing. If your frog is on a diving turtle when it dives, your frog will drown. 

* Again, time your jumps to coincide with the logs and turtles to ensure you will always have a solid footing to jump to. As the levels progress, you will have less things you can jump to. 

* You can jump on the backs of the crocodiles and otters. Just don't get near their mouths or they are apt to turn your frog into a meal. 

* You may see a purple lady frog hopping around on a log in water lane #2. Just cross over her to give her a piggyback ride to your home and get an extra 200 points. 

* Watch out for the snakes, they sometimes like to ride on the logs. If you see a snake on a log, jump back to solid footing. 

* Your frog cannot 'wrap-around' the screen so make sure you bail off before that footing disappears off the edge of the screen or your frog will come out the other side in a squished condition. 

* By that same token, if you have the time and necessary footing, you can hold out until the fly appears in your home before you settle your frog in. That's another 200 points. 

* Try to fill in the two end homes before going for the middle. The hardest home to get into is the left-hand one (home #1) since everything in water lane #5 goes from right to left. This means you may have to bounce back to water lane #4 so you can get a good shot at your home. 

* Speaking of getting your frogs into their homes, you must hit exact center or your frog will die. Also, keep in mind that crocodiles like to randomly appear in your home. Make sure that your home is clear before trying to settle your frog down into it. 

* Again, if you waste too much time, the things on the river will move quicker so you will have to adjust your strategy accordingly. 

* When the game is playing in attract mode, you can control the frog. When the frog reaches water lane #4, you can control the frog's movements until you move either up or down. 

* If you jump into your home at the same time the crocodile is leaving your home, you will be credited with making to your home but you will still lose a frog in the process. 

* You can dangle your frog from the left side of the turtles but not the right side. 

* Your side-to-side movements in water lane #5 may be slow and sluggish. 

* The lady frog will sometimes be invisible. In this case, the only time you know she's there is when you jump on her. She will then ride on your back to your home.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Front Line (c) 1982 Taito.

Front Line is Taito America Corporation's action war game. Traveling through enemy territory the player must accomplish the ultimate mission or meet a violent end: capture the enemy fort and win total victory.

The journey begins slowly with the player armed with a gun (special Gun Control) and hand grenades. Quickly he becomes a target for enemy soldiers who also have guns and grenades. Moving faster, he races past trees that hide the enemy who now unleash an ambush barrage of bullets and bombs. Even the ground he races over has been booby-trapped with land mines.

If the player successfully makes it through this deadly obstacle course, he meets an even greater challenge... the enemy is attacking with tanks! His gun now useless, the player can stand and fight with grenades or leap into his own tank (special Tank button) and counter attack.

The battle rages on all fronts as the player fights for his life, racing for cover behind brick walls while outrunning grenades thrown by soldiers in fox holes. It's all-out war when the player jumps from his tank into a larger one with greater firepower.

Now comes the final test of victory as the enemy's fort looms in sight. The player must leap from the tank and run through a hail of bullets to throw one final grenade. The white flag heralds total victory!

Golden Axe - The Revenge of Death Adder (c) 1992 Sega.

Like it's legendary prequel, 1989's "Golden Axe"; 'Revenge' is sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which the evil 'Death Adder' has arisen to take over the lands. The game supports simultaneous four-player gameplay, with each player taking on one of the game's characters. The four available characters are 'Sternblade' (a barbarian warrior), 'Dora' (a female centaurian), 'Goah' (a giant with a dwarf sitting atop his shoulders) and 'Little Trix' (an agile, oriental-style warrior).

As with 'Golden Axe', as well as standard weapon attacks, each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will cause the player to charge and smash into opponents. At certain points during the game, players will come across certain creatures and contraptions (such as dragons, giant scorpions and catapults) which, once the original occupier has been removed from the saddle, can be mounted and ridden/utilized to attack the enemy.

At certain points during a level, as well as at the end of each level, dwarfs appears carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the dwarfs causing them to drop food and magic potions. During the course of the game, players will also come across numerous trapped prisoners. These can be released by either opening their cages (by pulling a rope or similar) or hacking at their foot manacles.

Unlike the linear level layout of its prequel, 'Revenge' offers the player a branching route through the game, adding to its variety and longevity.

- TRIVIA -

Golden Axe TRODA was released in July 1992.

Gilius, the dwarf of the first episode is not directly playable on this sequel, but appears on the back of a giant named Goah.

Each time when you win a stage a map screen shows up. That map screen actually contains ancient Greek words, which translate as follows:
* The word at the bottom means 'river'. 
* The bottom-left word means 'cave'. 
* The bottom-right word means 'forest'. 
* The word in the center means 'town'. 
* The upper-left word means 'graveyard'. 
* The word in the upper-right corner means 'sea'. 
* And finally the word on top is the name of an ancient Greek mythological monster.

Wave Master released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Golden Axe The Music - WM-0595~7) on 21/02/2008 containing music from the original arcade and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis series.

- UPDATES -

The Japanese version has some differences:
* Has 5 scenes (levels) instead of 7.
* Is a 2 players game only instead of 4.
* You have 2 lives and 24 of energy instead of 1 live and 40 of energy.

The US version has some differences:
* Forces the player to play all the 7 scenes (stages) of the game in a single play-through, while other versions present two intersections (both 2-ways) during the game to the player to choose from, so he/she can only see 5 scenes in a single play-through. Needless to say the latter make more sense.
* Is a 4-player game while other versions are 2-player.
* You have 1 live and 40 unit of energy while other versions have 2 live and 24 unit of energy.
* Has the "Recycle It, Don't Trash It!" and the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When 2 or more people are playing, it's possible to grab an enemy in a body slam technique by attacking the enemy simultaneously, which can cause a lot of damage.

* In the PIER level, when the tentacles appear, attacking them will chop the tentacle's tip off. The tip can then be picked up (and eaten) and will increase the player's health, having the same effect as the dwarf's food powerup.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 23 years ago:

Gaia Crusaders (c) 1999 Noise Factory.

Gaia Crusaders is a one or two-player side-scrolling beat-em-up in which players must battle Satan and his army of demons that have captured and taken over the world. Players select a character from a choice of five combatants known as 'Elemental Warriors'. Each of the characters possesses either Wind strength, Fire strength, or a mix of the two. 

The game has the standard punch and kick attack moves as well as magical special moves. Combos can be strung together by switching quickly between kicking and punching. Players can also perform a 'super attack' by pressing the jump, punch and kick buttons simultaneously, this hits many enemies at once but costs the player character some health. It's also possible to raise a shield by pressing jump and kick simultaneously.

At regular intervals coloured spheres appear, players can pick these up to gain a magical attack. The effects of the magic attack differs depending on the player character. If the magic matches the character's elemental attribute (fire, wind or both), they will gain a special, screen-clearing attack. Otherwise, they earn a powerful special attack. 

In addition to the elemental spheres, there are two types of bombs that also appear, both of which detonate immediately once picked up. The first is an earthquake that hits all on-screen enemies and inflicts a large amount of damage. The second is a random bomb that sends out pillars of fire, hurting any enemies they come into contact with. There are also explosive boxes that can be kicked at enemies to keep them at bay. One last notable item is the sword, which functions much like weapons that can be found on the ground in many other beat 'em ups. A boss battle awaits players at the end of each stage.

Gaia Crusaders is heavily influenced by another scrolling beat-em-up, Capcom's 1989 classic, Final Fight and also, to a lesser degree, by Sega's Golden Axe (the latter being the use of the Magical Attack acting as a smart bomb).

The game's five selectable characters and their attributes are as follows:

** Fred Sathal - Magical Attribute: Fire and Wind **
Fred Sathal is one of the faster characters and has some very acrobatic combo moves.

** Jimi Isaak - Magical Attribute: Wind **
Isaak is the all-around fighter with average speed, defense and power.

** Kohen - Magical Attribute: Fire **
Kohen is a priestess who always carries a piece of paper inscribed with a magical rune. If the final strike of her combo attack is a punch, she throws the rune and the enemy is engulfed in flame. Kohen is fast and strong but has weak defenses and takes extra damage as a result.

** Koufu - Magic Attribute: Wind **
Koufu is a wizard specialising in magical spells, including fireballs and force-fields. Koufu has good defenses and power, at the expense of speed.

** M-985 - Magic Attribute: Wind and Fire **
M985 is a robot that utilises its robotic limbs to attack, including fast-spinning arms and energy cannons that extrude from its back. M-985 is very fast and has strong armour but its attacks inflict less damage than other characters. its special move is also weak; a small explosion appears around its legs that only hits enemies directly on top of it.

This is the first Noise Factory game. This game might be a code rip-off of the game "Pretty Soldier - Sailor Moon".

Gaia Crusaders was never released in Japan even if it was supposed to be distributed by Manjyudo in Japan...

The fifth boss is a rip-off of 'The Incredible Hulk'. At the end of Stage 5, he buffs up and turns green.

- UPDATES -

When the DIP switch is set to English, the Japanese subtitle written in kanji underneath the title reads 'Seisensha'. This could be translated (rather clumsily) to 'Journeying Soldier' or (to the better sounding) 'Crusader' for this particular instance, since there is a religious overtone in the prologue of the game, even though the Japanese word 'Seisensha' is as secular as the word 'chair' and doesn't contain a underlying religious meaning such as with the case of the word 'Crusader'.
When the DIP switch is set to Japanese, the Japanese subtitle is just the title of the game written in katakana, which is read as 'Gaia Kuruseidaazu'.

		<name>Galaga</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 41 years ago:

Galaga (c) 1981 Namco. 

Galaga is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a 'Fighter' spaceship and must defend the home planet against the on-coming hordes of alien invaders called "Galagans". The Fighter can only move left and right along the bottom of the screen. 

Galagans fly onto the screen in a variety of formations before forming troop lines at the top of the screen. Once all troop lines are formed the Galagans separate and start attacking the player's Fighter in ones, twos and threes. The top-line Boss Galaga need to be shot twice before they are destroyed. 

The Boss Galaga has a tractor beam that can capture the player's Fighter. A captured Fighter changes color from white to red and stays with that particular Boss until it is destroyed. The Fighter can be retrieved by destroying the Boss that captured it, but players must be careful not to destroy the captured Fighter itself, or that Fighter is lost. A rescued Fighter changes color back to white and links up with the player's current Fighter, doubling its fire power. 

As players progress through each screen, the speed and number of alien attacks increases. Alien formations also become more complex, making the aliens harder to shoot. 

Bonus Fighters are awarded periodically throughout the game, as players reach specific point values, as dictated by the 'Bonus Life' dip switch setting. Each enemy ship also has an assigned point value (see Scoring below). 

The alien troop lines that form at the top of the screen are, from top to bottom: Boss Galaga (in one row of four), Butterflies (red/white bug ships, in two rows of eight, directly below the Boss Galaga), and Bees (blue/yellow bug ships, in two rows of ten, directly below the Butterflies). 

In Stage 1, the enemies do not drop bombs as they fly onto the screen. However, they do so in most of the later stages. 

From Stage 4 onwards, a squadron of special bonus enemies called "transforms" start appearing. They're called transforms because Bees will begin pulsating and move out of formation to change into these bonus enemies. They appear in the form of yellow scorpions in Stages 4, 5, and 6, green 'Spy Ships' from "Bosconian" in Stages 8, 9, and 10, and Galaxian Flagships in Stages 12, 13, and 14. After that, the three different transforms are repeated in the same order. Transforms are always worthwhile targets because they are not very aggressive and are worth more than the other enemies. If all three transforms are destroyed, extra bonus points will be awarded. 

Galaga also features CHALLENGING STAGES, these consist of 40 Galagans that fly onto the screen in formations but do not drop any bombs. The object is to shoot as many of them as possible before they leave the play area. When an entire formation of eight Galagans is destroyed, bonus points are added to the player's score. If all 40 aliens are destroyed, players are awarded a special bonus of 10,000 points. 

Two new gameplay features Galaga introduced are: 
1) Players are given the chance to double their fire power. 
2) The game has a rapid fire (automatic firing) option, whereby the player simply holds the FIRE button down and the space fighter continues to fire at the Galagan army in bursts of two missiles each.

- TRIVIA -

Galaga was released in September 1981 in Japan.

Although Galaga was a superior game, it didn't sell the large numbers that "Galaxian" did. One of the first games with a bonus stage. 

The game 'rolls over' at 999,990 points. The 1P score counter is six digits, but the 2P counter is seven digits. Therefore, most good players start a 2-player game and play exclusively on the 2P side so their score won't 'roll over' at 999,990. After the 1,000,000 mark, new Fighters are no longer awarded. 

What happens after finishing Stage 255 depends upon the skill level set in the DIP switches: 
* On the easy skill, the game resets. 
* On the medium skill, the game flips to "Stage 0" which plays as a strange cross between the 2nd Challenging Stage and a regular level where the enemies shoot. The game will advance to Stage 1 after completion, and the game will get easy again. 
* On the hard skill setting, the words "Stage 0" stay on the screen forever. No more enemies ever appear. The player can continue to move the ship and fire, but there is no way to advance to the next level, or to die. To play again, the machine must be reset. 
* On the hardest skill, the game flips to "Stage 0" which plays like Stage 1 (no extra enemies when flying onto the screen), but it is still as difficult as Stage 255. The game will advance to Stage 1 after completion, and the game will get easy again. 

If you have more than seven extra Fighters, the marker for the screen will only show 7 1/2 (!) Fighters remaining. Additional extra Fighters will still be credited, even though they won't show on the screen. 

In Japan, the Bees are referred to as 'Zako' and the Butterflies are referred to as 'Goei'. 

Stephen Krogman holds the official record for this game with 15,999,990 points. 

A Galaga unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', the 1983 movie 'Spring Break' (being played by one of the main characters), the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid,' the 1987 movie 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men', Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes), and was shown in 2012 movie 'The Avengers' (a agent soldier was surprised playing in the Helicarrier computer).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Enemy Stop Shooting: on the first stage, kill everything but the two Bees in the bottom left corner. Then just wait, dodging the enemies' shots, until the enemy no longer drops any shots towards you. After the enemies stop firing, let them pass for two more trips and then kill them. For the rest of the game, the enemies will not drop shots. It will take approximately 15 minutes for the enemies to quit shooting at you, so this trick requires a lot of patience. Note: in a 2-player game, only one person has to do the cheat for both players to benefit. But as soon as one of the player's game is over the enemies begin shooting again.

* (BUG) Take The Control Of The Fighter For Free: during the Galaga demo, the Boss Galaga comes down and tries to tractor-beam the Fighter. As soon as that tractor-beam starts, the player can take control of the ship in the demo. The player has two choices here and this will effect how the game handles this bug: If the player allows himself to be captured, the demo will continue as normal and he has the option of controlling the player Fighter or not. The player can choose whether to save the captured Fighter, try to complete the level, etc. The demo mode will complete after 30 seconds and the high-score screen will appear. If the player takes control of the Fighter and destroys the Boss Galaga with the tractor beam, some of the characters on the screen will freeze while others are still moving and doing what they are suppose to be doing. This will last 15-20 seconds, then the game will go to the high score screen.

* Challenging stages are easier if the high score numbers are used to refine your aim. These tips assume a 6-digit high score:
1) On the first two challenging stages, aim your ships so that your left set of bullets falls between the second and third numbers in the high score list.
2) On subsequent challenging stages, aim one set of your bullets between the first and second numbers in the high score list (if the units come from the left) or between the last and next-to-last numbers (if the units come from the right). This will allow you to hit descending enemies at the highest possible point.

* Here is a neat (and useless) Galaga trick: It is possible to end the game with a 200% ratio. The 200% hit-miss ratio trick can only be done with your first shot of the game. When the game starts, don't move, and fire only one shot. If you time it correctly, two enemies will be killed at once. Let your remaining Fighters be destroyed, and presto: a better-than-perfect result.

* Easter Egg:
1) Enter service mode.
2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence: Right(x5), Left(x6), Right(x3), Left(x7). '(c) 1981 NAMCO LTD.' will be added at the bottom of the screen.

		<name>Galaxian</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 43 years ago:

Galaxian (c) 1979 Namco.

Galaxian is a legendary single-screen shoot-em-up that took everything that made Taito's ground-breaking "Space Invaders" so good, and improved upon it on every level. Each screen starts with a wave of multi-colored aliens moving left and right at the top of the screen; the aliens quickly break ranks and start dive-bombing the Galaxip (player's ship) - either in single units or in groups of 3 - dropping multiple missiles as they descend. All of the aliens need to be destroyed before the player can progress to the next wave. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Galaxip: This is the name of the ship which you control at the bottom of the screen. 

Galaxian: These attacking aliens come in three varieties: blue, purple, and red. They begin in formation at the top of the screen and will occasionally swoop down to attack you before returning to their position in the formation. 

Flagship: At least two of these appear at the top of the formation at the start of each stage. They will swoop down to attack with one or two red Galaxians if any are nearby. If a flagship is one of the last enemies left of the screen, it will run away and appear as a third Flagship at the start of the next stage.

- TECHNICAL -

This was the first title to use the now familiar 'Namco Cabinet', which was used for Galaxian, "Galaga", "Pac-Man", "Ms. Pac-Man". Several other titles used nearly identical cabinets as well. These machines are white, with painted sideart of a green dragonfly alien (done up in blue, green. and black). The marquee is rather large and displays a blue and green 'Galaxian' logo (which is painted on a sheet of glass, they don't make them like that anymore). The control panel and monitor bezel are not highly decorated, but do feature some game instructions. Finally this machine uses neon green t-molding (edge trim), it is difficult to find replacement trim in that same exact shade.

The earliest Galaxian machines used a 25-inch G02 monitor, but later machines shipped with the standard 19-inch Electrohome G07 monitor. Any normal standard resolution arcade monitor should work as a replacement. "Pac-Man" PCBs will work in Galaxian machines, but require a 4-way joystick, instead of the 2-way model that Galaxian normally has. The sound pinout is also different, so one would need to rewire the connector to hear any Pac-Man sounds. You can also plug a Galaxian PCB into a Pac-Man. Again, the sound would need to be wired up at the connector and you'd have to push UP on the joystick to fire.

- TRIVIA -

Galaxian was released on October 31, 1979 in Japan.

Galaxian was the first video game to be released with 100 percent of its graphics displayed in true R.G.B. color. 

Space battles of all kinds played a major role during the golden age of video games. With the introduction of Galaxian, players were transported to the most colorful and challenging space battle yet.

* A place in video game history: "Galaxian captivated the minds of quite a few arcade enthusiasts," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "It was a relatively early entry in the golden age of video games, and it capitalized on the enthusiasm created by the earlier video game classic, "Space Invaders", while providing a more colorful, enjoyable, and demanding gaming experience.
Galaxian had smarter bad guys than "Space Invaders", and it demanded that the player really pay attention to what was going on. And there were no shields, like many games have today. You really had to stay on the ball. Galaxian also had great sound and used elements that have since become standard -- such as flags and other symbols to mark the player's progression through different levels of game play.".

* The great 25-cent escape: "Galaxian definitely gets an enthusiastic response," Lindsey said. "In fact, I deliberately position the game near the entrance of the museum. Often it's the first game people go to." Lindsey often sees parents trying to convey to their child the excitement of these great games. "It is funny for me when I see a father trying to explain a game to his kid. Junior really just wants to get on the game and figure it out, and Dad wants to do a demo. Dad starts instructing Junior while Junior is sort of looking around, wondering how he can get away. But Dad continues, busily explaining the nuances of the game, which he knows Junior can't get on the first play. This all shows the enthusiasm that a certain generation still has for these terrific games."
With or without a parent's help, Lindsey sees a younger generation embracing the classic arcade games. "Kids by themselves will actually do quite well on these games," Lindsey said. "I'm somewhat surprised when I see how good kids are at picking up games. I sort of think that because I'm older, I should be able to play better, and that's not always the case with video games. That's a lesson an entire generation has had to learn.".

* Namco notes: Galaxian was one of Namco's first video games, and engineers throughout the company were gathered into a special team. As the game neared completion, the engineers suspected they had created a good game because other Namco employees were extremely "excited and crazy about the game." Once Galaxian was released, they knew they had a winner because, as one Namco engineer reported, "People [at the arcades] piled their coins onto the game cabinets to keep playing, and those who were waiting were very irritated because their turn never came. There were huge lines of people around each machine.".

The Galaxian Flagship became a trademark of Namco as it makes cameo appearances in other Namco classics:
* "Pac-Man" (1980) and "Pac-Man Plus" (1982): The flagship makes an appearance as the bonus fruit in rounds 9 and 10, and is worth 2,000 points if Pac-Man eats it. 
* "Galaga" (1981): The flagship makes an appearance as one of the "transform" ships. It splits into 2, then 3 clones of itself. They are worth 160 points each, and killing all 3 scores a bonus of 3,000 points. 
* "Dig Dug" (1982): The flagship makes an appearance as the bonus vegetable in rounds 16 and 17, and is worth 7,000 points if Dig Dug picks it up. 
* "Super Pac-Man" (1982): All regular edible items on rounds 15, 31, 47, and 63 are flagships, and they are worth 150 points each. Starting from their second appearance, Round 31, they are 160 points instead. 
* "Pac &amp; Pal" (1983): The flagship makes an appearance as one of the "special items" that make Pac-Man turn blue when eaten, and allows him to stun the ghosts for a short while by shooting a Galaga-style tractor beam. It is worth 1,000 points if Pac-Man eats it or intercepts it from Miru. 
* "Pac-Land" (1984): The ghosts in airplanes sometimes drop flagships and they are worth 7,650 points (765 being Namco's goroawase number in Japanese) if eaten. 
* "Super Xevious" (1984): The flagship makes an appearance in a silver form and as an enemy, and sometimes several of them attack at once. They are worth 300 points each. 
* "Quester" (1987): In Round 5, the bricks form a Galaxian Flagship.
* "Pac-Mania" (1987): The flagship makes a 3-D appearance as a special item and in two forms as well, the other one being the silver form from "Super Xevious". The regular one and the silver one are worth 7,650 points if eaten.
* "Pistol Daimyo no Bouken" (1990): The flagship makes an appearance as an enemy along with the other Galaxian characters, and they attempt to hit Pistol Daimyo with their fire. 
* "Tinkle Pit" (1994): The flagship also makes an appearance with the other Galaxian characters, but this time they appear as bonus items. It is worth 800 points if collected. 
* "Tekken" (1994 - Arcade, 1995 - PlayStation) and "Tekken 2" (1995 - Arcade, 1996 - PlayStation): Winning at least seven rounds in Arcade Vs. mode will reveal the Galaxian flagship on the lower left (or right) hand corner of the screen. In order for this to work, "Number of Wins Shown By" must be set to Fruit. 
* "Namco Classic Collection Vol.1" (1995): The flagship makes an appearance in "Galaga Arrangement" as a Challenging Stage enemy in Space-Plant Zone (Stage 20) and normally in Space-Flower Zone (Stage 26). If killed normally, they are worth 150 points. If killed in Challenging Stage, they are worth 300 points.
* "Namco Classic Collection Vol.2" (1996): The flagship appears in both "Pac-Man Arrangement" and "Dig Dug Arrangement". In "Pac-Man Arrangement", it makes its appearance in World 4-1 and 4-2 and is worth 5,000 points if Pac-Man eats it. In "Dig Dug Arrangement", it appears in Stages 17 and 18 and is worth 7,000 points if Dig Dug picks it up.
* "Pac-Man World" (1999): The flagship appears again in a Pac-Man game. This time, the item must be collected in order to access the mazes.
* "Pac-Man World 2" (2002) and "Pac-Man World 3 (2005): The flagship teleports Pac-Man to mazes. The point value will be the same as the points earned in the maze (if completed), plus 2000.
* "Namco Museum Battle Collection" (2005): The arrangement versions of "Pac-Man" and "Dig Dug", later called "Pac-Man Remix" and "Dig Dug Remix" in the iOS version, feature the flagship. "Pac-Man Remix" features both the flagship, worth 3,200 points, and the red drone, worth 2,800 points, as fruit items, while on "Dig Dug Remix", the flagship is a vegetable item and is worth 7,000 points. 
"Dig Dug - Digging Strike" (2005): Just like the first "Dig Dug", the flagship appears as a vegetable on stage 13, except it's worth 6,000 points.
"Pac-Man Championship Edition" (2007) and "Pac-Man Championship Edition DX" (2010): The flagship reappears, but is this time joined by the Galaga Boss, Queen Gaplus, and two drones, one each from "Galaga" and Galaxian.

Gary Whelan holds the official record for this game with 1,114,550 points, achieved August 24, 2006 at Dukinfield in the UK.

The game can be played while the main game loads in the Sony PlayStation's port of "Ridge Racer".

- UPDATES -

The only code difference between the original Namco version and the licensed Midway version is that the 'Bonus Galaxip' text is printed on a different line.

In Namco Set 2: 
* Lives dip switch can be set to 3 or 5 lives. The default is 3 lives.
* Extra life dip switch can be set to 4,000 (meaning a bonus Galaxip at 4,000 points), 5,000 points, 7,000 points, or None (meaning no bonus Galaxip at any time). The default is 4,000.

In Midway Set 2: 
* Extra life dip switch can be set to None, 3,000, 4,000, or 5,000. The default is None.

In the bootleg version: 
* Extra life dip switch can be set to None, 20,000, 40,000, or 80,000. The default is None.

- SCORING -

Blue Galaxian: 30 points in formation, 60 points in flight
Purple Galaxian: 40 points in formation, 80 points in flight
Red Galaxian: 50 points in formation, 100 points in flight

* The maximum possible score shown is 999,990. Scores higher than this roll back to zero, but the high score will show the last score achieved before the rollover, which can vary from 999,990 to 999,200.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The action starts immediately as soon as you start your game. The Galaxians will be set up in formation and your Galaxip will be placed in the middle of the bottom of the screen. The action starts immediately. You can only have one shot in the air at any time so plan your shots accordingly. The game starts off slowly with only 2 or 3 Galaxians attacking your Galaxip at one time. They will drop 3 to 4 laser shots. As the waves progress, more Galaxians will come after your Galaxip until you will usually have 10-15 at any one time swooping down on it.

Each wave starts out with the Galaxians in formation, in the following quantities (in order from top to bottom):
Flagships: 2 (plus any that have escaped from battle in the previous wave, up to a maximum of 4 altogether)
Red Galaxians (Escorts): 6 (in 1 row, directly below the flagships)
Purple Galaxians: 8 (in 1 row, directly below the red Galaxians)
Blue Galaxians: 30 (in 3 rows of 10, directly below the purple Galaxians)

Flagships and red Galaxians are special enemies: they create convoys. Flagships have other special properties (see below). Purple and blue Galaxians are regular enemies.

* The Galaxip can fire only shot on the screen at a time. It is possible to kill 2 enemies with one shot if they are flying extremely close to each other.

* Missiles shot at the formation which miss by going between columns or near an outer edge of a column, will cause the formation to pause its left-right movement for a very short moment. This will usually, but not always, prevent missed shots near the columns from hitting the enemies in the upper rows of the formation which might otherwise be hit by moving into the shot as it flies by.

* Enemies peel away from the formation and attack the Galaxip. Enemies fire at the Galaxip during their attack, but they can’t fire after they pass an invisible horizontal line just above the Galaxip.

* Enemies always begin attack runs from the edges of the formation, never from the middle. This also applies to Flagships but it is not readily observable unless there are 3 or 4 Flagships present.

* A 'swarm' is triggered by either of 2 criterion:
1. The total number of enemies in formation is 3 or less.
2. The total number of blue and purple Galaxians in formation is zero. This can occur when there are many Flagships and red Galaxians still present in formation.

* When the 'swarm' starts, enemies that begin an attack do not return to formation: they keep attacking. Once started, a 'swarm' can only be ended by killing all of the enemies and/or letting them escape, or by the Galaxip getting hit. 

* Before the 'swarm' starts, enemies that attack, which are not killed, return to the formation. Since these enemies were on the edge of the formation and able to attack once, they are very likely to attack again soon.

* When not in 'swarm', a maximum of 4 regular enemies can attack at any one time.

* Flagships and convoys can attack at any time as long as another convoy attack is not already commencing; only one convoy attack can happen at a time.

* A Flagship will always create a convoy with the maximum number of red escorts available to it, unless the 'swarm' has started.

* The Flagships 'capture' up to 3 red escorts while they are in formation:  Whenever there is a Flagship in formation directly above an escort or above it to one side, that escort is captured and cannot attack on its own. This capture effect ends when a 'swarm' begins.

* The Flagships can escape from the battle only if all three red escorts under their place in the formation have been killed. Flagships that escape will appear on the next attack wave, up to a maximum of 4 Flagships at the start of any wave.

* When an attacking Flagship is killed, all enemies stop firing for a short period of time. If this kill occurs before the 'swarm', there will also be no new attacks from the formation during this period. These benefits never occur for killing a Flagship that is in formation.

* The flags which count the rounds show a maximum of round 48; rounds 48 and up are shown as round 48. However if round 256 is achieved, the flags start to roll over, but with some graphical glitches; the flags that were showing round 48 begin to get overwritten, one at a time. This results in the big 10-flags being cut in half by the regular flags which start to appear, until all 4 of the 10-flags are replaced by small ones. 16 single flags show during rounds 256+8 and 256+9 (rounds 264 and 265). The glitch ends at round 256+10 (266), which shows a single 10 flag.

* After wave 1, it is possible to kill any one enemy, even a Flagship, in a brand new formation by shooting at just the right time and place before the formation teleports in at the start of a new round.

* The Galaxians that come down in a smooth pattern are the easiest to kill plus their shots are easy to avoid. The hard ones to kill (usually the purple Galaxians) are the ones where the Galaxian 'bounces' from side-to-side dropping shots since those shots cover a very large area.

* The corners can be a death trap. When the Galaxians come down firing, their shots do not come straight down but they angle toward the direction that the Galaxian is traveling. In addition, the Galaxians have a tendency to 'charge' into the corners. You get the points if a Galaxian rams your Galaxip but you also lose your Galaxip in the process.

* The Flagships are the big points in the game. Try to avoid shooting the red Galaxians since they act as escorts for the Flagship. Wait until a Flagship comes down with two escorts. If you can't get aligned to take all three out quickly, let them pass. If you do get a good angle on them, you will have to fire quickly to pick off the two escorts first, then the Flagship. If you hit the Flagship first, you get significantly less points.

* Do not stop moving. If you do, you will be caught in a crossfire. The Galaxians tend to leave small areas of safety open between their shots. Also, make sure you are constantly hitting their formation to reduce their numbers (again, don't kill off the red ones).

* As you progress into the higher waves, the Galaxians tend to move quicker, fly more erratic patterns, and 'gang up' on your Galaxip. Plan accordingly for this.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Musashi Ganryu Tale'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Ganryu'.

This game runs on the Neo-Geo MVS but was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.

On April 14th, 1612, Musashi defeated the famous - and some think superior - fencer Sasaki Ganryu Kojiro using a simple wooden sword which he carved from a boat oar on the way to the duel. Musashi had an opportunity to see Kojiro's sword sometime before the duel and knew of it's great length. Musashi carved the wooden sword to be of greater length. When Musashi arrived on the beach for the duel, he kept the wooden sword hidden behind him until the duel began. He jumped over a low strike of Kojiro, reaching about a meter off the ground and came down hard on Kojiro's head with his heavy wooden sword. Kojiro lay dying on the sand and Musashi left in a hurry without killing him. Some of Musashi's critics call him a coward for not killing him, but Musashi had proved his point as the killing of Kojiro was not the goal - defeating him was. This is why the Kojiro character in Musashi Ganryuki has a huge gash on his forehead. The storyline of Musashi Ganryuki is that Kojiro has come back from the dead to try and kill Musashi.

		<name>Garou - Mark of the Wolves</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 23 years ago:

Garou - Mark of the Wolves (c) 1999 SNK.

Garou: Mark of the Wolves is a one-on-one fighting game and is the 9th title in SNK's Fatal Fury series. Ten years after crime-lord Geese Howard's death, the city of Southtown is now a peaceful place, leading it to be known as the Second Southtown. A new fighting tournament called King of Fighters: Maximum Mayhem is created, with several characters related to fighters from the previous "King of Fighters" tournaments participating.

The game features 12 characters and foregoes the plane-switching style of its predecessors in favour of standard, single-plane battles. Garou introduced the "Tactical Offense Position" (T.O.P.), a special area on the fighter's life gauge. When the gauge reaches this area, the character enters the T.O.P. mode, granting them the ability to use T.O.P. attack, gradual life recovery, and increased attack damage. 

The game also introduced the Just Defend system, which rewards players who successfully block an attack at the last moment, granting them a small amount of health recovery and the ability to immediately counter-attack out of block stun.

If players win all rounds with a ranking of AAA, they will face the boss 'Kain R. Heinlein', defeating him unlocks a special ending. If the AAA requirements are not met, Grant will be the final boss and there will be no special ending. Additionally, before facing Grant players will face a mid-boss, who, depending on which character the player is using, can be any character from the game's cast.

- TRIVIA -

Released in November 1999.

'Garou' translates from Japanese as 'Hungry Wolf'. 'Mark of the Wolves' is a reference to the legacy left behind by Terry to a new generation of fighters - specifically, Rock Howard. This can also refer to the legacy left by other characters from the previous Fatal Fury &amp; Art of Fighting games. Kim Dong Hwan &amp; Kim Jae Hoon are sons of Tae-Kwon Do fighter Kim Kaphwan. Khushmood Butt is a master of Kyokugenryu Karate, the same martial used by Ryo Sakazaki from Art of Fighting. Hokutomaru uses Shiranui-style Ninjitsu as his fighting style, this is the same ninja arts that Mai Shiranui uses, however Hokutomaru was trained by Andy Bogard.

Garou pushes the capabilities of the Neo-Geo MVS hardware to its limit, giving some of the best-looking graphics to date. Some critics saying that there is life after all in the Neo-Geo hardware, which was past its prime when the game was released.

Hokutomaru's stage has quite a few references to the rest of the "Fatal Fury" series. To the extreme left of the stage is a billboard with a picture of the old style Terry Bogard. A portrait of Geese Howard and his lieutenants can be seen on another billboard (this is the same picture that is seen in the flyer for Real Bout Fatal Fury). There is also a picture of Andy Bogard and Mai Shiranui holding hands posing as a bank advertisement right above another picture of Alfred.

The sign that Khushnood Butt shows off in his victory pose is a Kyokugen Karate dojo sign.

The Rock Howard music stage contains a part of Robert Miles' seminal trance tune "Children" (1996).

Rock Howard is the son of the notorious crime-lord Geese Howard, the boss of previous Fatal Fury games. Rock was trained to fight by Terry Bogard and has incorporated moves from Terry and Geese's styles into his own fighting style. Rock is also related to Garou's main boss of the game: Kain R. Heinlein. Geese Howard married Marie Heinlein, whom is the sister of Kain. So, we can assume that Kain is Rock's uncle.

The word 'Tizoc' (The Griffon Mask's Japanese name) means 'sick leg', or 'lame leg'. It was the name of an ancient Mexican tlatoani, or leader, who ruled from 1481 until 1486, when he was poisoned by Aztec aristocrats.

If a double KO occurs, a round is won by each fighter, which can end a battle on this quite unsatisfying note. Moreover in this case, the player has no fighting level, neither displayed on the screen nor counted for the points.

Soundtracks release:
[JP] Jan. 21, 2000; Garou - Mark of the Wolves [SCDC-00006] Scitron

- UPDATES -

The prototype version has a white background at the title screen instead a blue background on the final version. It has also a graphic bug on the Terry Bogard stage during the second round at the extreme right.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Random Fighter: Hold Start and press a Punch or Kick button at the character selection screen.

* Play as Grant: At the character select screen, highlight Dong Hwan, hold Start and press Up(x2) Down(x2), Up, Down.

* Play as Kain R. Heinlein: At the character select screen, highlight Jae Hoon, hold Start and press Down(x2), Up(x2), Down, Up.

* Play against Kain R. Heinlein: To reach Kain, you must finish the first 7 matches with an average fighting level of AAA. Your best bet would be to avoid losing any rounds throughout the preliminary 7 stages, especially Grant. If you meet this condition after defeating Grant, you'll get a cutscene featuring Kain R. Heinlein. Beat Kain to reveal your characters' true ending.

* Alternate Costume Colors: Each character has 4 colors, corresponding to each button.

* Secret Taunts: After defeating your opponent, hold Left or Right and tap Start to use an hidden taunt. Every character has two secret taunts (these can ONLY be used after defeating an opponent and before your character goes into his/her winning pose). Some of them, such as Hotaru's and Hokutomaru's are really cool!:)

Taunts in the game can affect the background stages in many ways. For example, by using a taunt during a fight in Hotaru's stage (Philanthropy Belfry) you can make the bells in the background move. Most stages have hidden animations that can only be seen by this trick so try it!:)

* Survival Mode: Insert a coin, hold A+B+C+D and press Start. You will then play a Survival Mode (quite hard one too).

* Rock's Win-pose: Rock will have a special win-pose when he finishes the opponent with a Shine Knuckle and a different one when he finishes the opponent with either a Raging Storm or the Deadly Rave Neo.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 36 years ago:

Gauntlet II (c) 1986 Atari Games.

Gauntlet II is a direct sequel to the legendary maze-based fantasy themed shoot-em-up, released a year earlier. Atari chose not to tinker with the core game-play mechanic to any great degree, opting instead to enhance the already excellent multi-player action that had created such a stir upon the original game's release.

As with its prequel, up to four players once again take on the role of either 'Thor the Warrior', 'Thyra the Valkyrie', 'Merlin the Wizard', or 'Questor the Elf' and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes, collecting potions, food and treasure as they searched for the exit that would lead them to the next dungeon.

Changes to the sequel included the ability for players to play whatever character they wanted, even if that character was already in play. Characters were now colour-coded and players would find themselves taking on the role of 'Blue Elf', 'Green Wizard', etc. New in-game speech was added to allow for the new player definitions.

Other changes included the ability to 'bounce' shots off walls - known as 'Reflective Shots' - providing the correct potion was picked up. As well as new potions, Gauntlet II also featured several new monsters. The most notorious of the new additions was the Fire-breathing Dragon that guards the exit to some dungeons. This powerful creature takes multiple hits to kill and defeating it would see the players rewarded with a permanent potion and a bag of treasure.

Another notable addition was the 'It' monster: any player who was tagged by the creature would suddenly find that all of that level's monsters would ONLY chase the tagged player, completely ignoring the presence of all other players. The only way to remove this curse was to tag another player, thus making them 'it'.

New level elements were also added to further increase variety. These included dungeons with entirely invisible walls, magical walls (which changed into monsters or items when hit), stun tiles (which stunned any player that walked on them) and exits that flashed between functioning and non-functioning.

- TRIVIA -

The original "Gauntlet" was released in October 1985, with the Gauntlet II conversion kits coming out nearly a year later, in August 1986. A lot of the original "Gauntlet" machines of the time were switched over to Gauntlet II cabinets. They tended to stay as Gauntlet II for some time, due to the relative scarcity of kits that would convert a "Gauntlet" cabinet to that of its sequel. The proper kits were uncommon until the late eighties, by which time four-player games were taking off in a big way.

Only 209 dedicated units were produced. The selling price was $2,295.
3,250 '4-Player kits' were produced. Selling price: $595
Only 61 '2-Player kits' were produced. Selling price: $395

Competition: Atari held a promotional competition to coincide with "Gauntlet II's" initial launch. If players followed the instructions the game gives before entering a secret room (the machine provides clues on how to enter the secret rooms whenever a hidden wall is shot away on any level), the player is greeted with a screen explaining that they had been awarded extra points and inviting the player to enter his or her name.
A six-digit code would then be given which the player could put onto a competition entry form. The first 500 entries drawn won Gauntlet II T-shirts, plus a chance of winning a $5000 savings bond. Machines can also be set (via dip switches) to suppress this screen, in which case players would get a screen saying '5000 points x coins = xxx' after doing the secret room. The contest ended in 1986.

Note: the game contains exactly 205 sounds! (including digitized voices, effects and musics), less than the first Gauntlet.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (That's Atari Music Vol.II: G.S.M. Atari Games 2 - PCCB-00070) on September 21, 1991.

- SCORING -

Key: 100 points.
Treasure: 100 - 500 points.
Each type of monster has a set score value.
Each generator is worth twice as many points as its associated monster.
Death: up to 6,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Secret Rooms: to get to a secret room, perform a secret trick on a level. Some of the secret tricks are:
1) Teleporting into the exit.
2) Pushing a movable wall into the exit
3) Keeping all the super shots
4) Not using invulnerability (this is almost always a good idea anyway)
5) Not touching a fake exit
6) Teleporting on top of Death and/or acid blobs
7) Not taking ANYTHING (the tick trick comes in handy here)

* The hints it gives to the secret room don't necessarily apply to your current level, just as on "Gauntlet". The secret trick usually doesn't work, but it is always same for any given board. You're allowed one secret trick for every 15 levels or so.

* You can kill the acid blobs! Just drop 2 potions in quick succession. This works regardless of your magic ability. It also puts the dragon back to sleep momentarily (You can also kill them with a teleporter...if there's a teleporter handy, that is).

* The '?' foods are NOT random. Grab a '?' food on health mod 20 = 7 (i.e. 27, 47, 67, etc). You'll get 200 health.

* Couple of strategy notes:
1) Reflective shots make the dragon easier
2) Invulnerability makes him very easy
3) Remember that when generators aren't on the screen, they don't generate monsters.
4) If you are playing two+ player you can kill almost all dragons with one player diverting his attention, or using an indirect attack. For example: you can find shootable walls or just stand in the right spot askew from the dragon. He will try to flame instead of fire-ball. If done correctly, you will be standing a wall away from him. Then your partner can go around and shoot flame head while the dragon is flaming away.

* If a previous game ended beyond Level 6, Level 6 in the next game becomes the level that the previous game ended on. If you got a really good sequence of boards in a game and you want to repeat them, turn the machine off and on again after you've entered your high score.

逆鱗弾 (c) 1995 Taito Corp.
(Gekirindan)

Blast your way through different time periods in this vertical scrolling shoot'em up.

In 3195 AD, scientists have developed a time-leap engine - but a mysterious entity known only as the Huge Boss has stolen it and used it to travel back in time and destroy 3000 years of mankind's history.

Two people rise up to defeat him: Hokuto, whose parents were murdered by the Huge Boss; and Shario, to fulfill a last promise to her dead sister. Together they pilot their aircraft and chase the Huge Boss.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the "Taito F3 System" Hardware.

Prom Stickers: E11

Players: 4
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 4

- TRIVIA -

Gekirindan was released in September 1995.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Reverse Scale Bullet' and is an example of 'ateji' - fitting the kanji phonetics to the name of the game to give the name double (sometimes even triple) meaning.

The game was originally named 'Fire Breaker' at early stage of development.

Lee Ota (from the Truxton series) produced this game. It's why the first and last stage, as well as the bomb/power-up system, are similar to "Truxton". The gameplay, however, is really different from Toaplan's games, so responses from Toaplan fans were not very favourable.

The name of the twin characters, Orsa and Mayoru, is a play-on-words of the third largest constellation of our solar system, Ursa Major, which means Great Bear.

All stages in this game share the same theme but remixed each time!

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'AAA'.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Welcome to the Karu Land - PCCB-00196) on November 17, 1995.

Released in November 1987.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Galactic Chivalry Story'.

This game is a parody of anime, manga, and other bits of Japanese popular culture. The default hi-score table's names are the names of various anime studios (4, 6-8) and manga publications (1, 5).

The list of enemies in attract mode is only partial. 'G. Robo' is Giant Robo, from the 7-part OVA series of the same name. 'Zaku' is from the original TV and movie series Mobile Suit Gundam, and was the Jion's main unit during the One-Year War era. 'Joe' is Joe Yabuki from Tomorrow's Joe, and is in fact the very same Joe from the Neo-Geo game "Legend of Success Joe".

On level 7, the guy with the hat and the bazooka is Jigen Daisuke from Lupin III (see the history entry for "Lupin III" for more info). The kung-fu guy who explodes when you kill him is Ken from Fist of the North Star, consisting of two TV series and one (bad) movie. Ken used a kung-fu technique that involved striking pressure points, causing his enemies to messily explode with a single tap of a finger.

The house that you pass through in level 1 is the apartment from Maison Ikkoku. The guy by the hole in the wall is Yotsuya, who broke the wall so he could more effectively pester his neighbor (the main character, Godai). The woman with the broom in the room next door is Kyoko, the landlady. The clock on the roof doesn't work.

Ginga Ninkyouden was released in Australia as "Galaxy Hero".

Ghost Pilots (c) 1991 SNK.

Ghost Pilots is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players set in World War II. An ambitious Nazi general has sent his forces against the Allies andwo freelance ace pilots  called Tom Phillips and Charlie Stingley, nicknamed 'Ghost Pilots', set off in their seaplanes to combat the Axis forces head on.

Before starting a stage, the player must choose one of two bomb types. In one of the two stages after the first, the player also has the option to choose a third unique bomb type (napalm bomb in the land strike stage and air mines in the air strike stage). At the start of the game a player starts with three bombs and can collect up to a maximum of nine bombs. In a two-player game, both players cannot choose the same bomb type.

Enemies consist of tanks, gunboats, jets and a number of other military units. Shooting a row of red planes grants collectible power-ups giving either stronger and more widespread firepower, or additional bombs and extra lives. Certain medium-sized enemies destroyed grant collectible bonus stars for additional score. The player loses a life if the seaplane is hit by enemy projectiles orcollides with enemy craft.

An end-of-level boss fight awaits players at the end of every stage.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 27 years ago:

Guardians / Denjinmakai II (c) 1995 Banpresto.

Guardians is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players featuring eight selectable characters. Controls consist of an eight-way joystick and three buttons; standard attack, jump and special attack. Pressing the standard attack button repeatedly when attacking will trigger a combo from the player-character. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. 

Enemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too often or when the player moves to a new area.

Each player-character has both a life bar and a power meter. The power meter allows for the special attacks to be made, either by pressing both standard attack and jump simultaneously, or by pressing the special attack button. These powerful attacks reduce the power meter but it does replenish itself after a few seconds. However, some of the player's health is lost in the process. Health levels can be replenished by finding food that lies hidden in breakable crates scattered through the stages.

A powerful boss enemy awaits player at the end of each stage.

Grid Seeker - Project Storm Hammer (c) 1992 Taito Corp.

It is August 1999. In the skies over the Middle East, the second Persian Gulf War has begun. The early half of the 90's, the Persian Gulf War breaks out in the Middle East and prolonged fighting rapidly increases the rate of destruction of the world's natural resources. In 1999 this develops into a state of crisis where the effects of the war have resulted in an absolute shortage of reserves. Mistaken policies have resulted in the nation of the Middle East, suffering from shortages since the time of the original Persian Gulf War, taking military action against neighboring nations in an attempt to assure a supply of resources for themselves. Those nations which have managed to escape the fighting once again form a Multinational Force. Using the technology gained from research which had been done for a new type of nuclear reactor, they succeed in developing and producing GRID - a Gyrodrive Reactive Intercept Device. This is the start of Project Storm Hammer.

- Choose from one of the three aircraft:
-- The F-14 Fighter: The fastest of the three but has the least powerful firepower, concentrated at the front.
-- The AH-64F Attack Helicopter: The most average but fires scattered shots.
-- The B-2AT Stealth Bomber: slow moving but has the greatest fire power when upgraded.

- Press the Fire button to attack normally. 

- Hold the Fire button while moving up and down to change the position of the GRID. 

- Press the Bomb button to use one of your bombs for a massive attack, which is different according to which colour GRID you have:
-- Red: A massive fireball damaging all enemies on the screen. 
-- Blue: A concentrated forward attack. 
-- Green: Green energy swirls around hitting enemies on the screen. 
-- Yellow: A concentrated explosion in a small area, doing massive damage. 

- When the GRID is hit by an enemy bullet, the power gauge at the bottom of the screen will increase. When the gauge reaches its maximum level, you will gain an extra bomb (up to a maximum of four). 

- Collect power-up items to upgrade your aircraft.


* ITEMS LIST:
(P) Power-Up: Increases your shot power by one level to a maximum of level 7.

Gunbird 2 (c) 1998 Psikyo.

In this vertical shoot'em up, you have five selectable characters who fight the big army of pirates but this time to collect elemental potions.

Released in December 1998 in Japan.

ALUCARD, a selectable character, backwards spells DRACULA.

Aine originally appeared in "Samurai Aces" and as a hidden character in "Tengai" as Ayin. Here in Gunbird 2, he has quite a 'different' type of bomb attack:).

Gunbird 2 shares some similarities with the 1975 anime series 'Time Bokan':
* The flag symbol in Time Bokan is a clear skull and in this game is a 2P like a skull.
* The thin guy has a very ugly nose also a moustache and teeth like a rabbit (he is the same in the game and the anime).
* The fat guy has a beard. In this game and in Time Bokan, he has a semi-shaved beard (so with the exception of the beard, the guy is almost the same).
* The chief is a luxuriant woman (in the anime, she always was topless in the end).
* In Time Bokan, the bad guys always show a stupid new-robot to defeat the good guys. In the game is the same. 

Note: There are 27 different endings!

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to three smileys.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Gunbird 2, Gunbird - SGCD-0003) on 04/12/1998.

		<name>Gyruss</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 39 years ago:

Gyruss (c) 1983 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

Gyruss is a single-player shoot-em-up in which the purpose is to fly through the solar system, destroying waves of alien attackers, before finally reaching Earth. Planets that must be passed before Earth is reached are Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. 

It only takes two warps to reach Neptune, but all of the others, including Earth, take three warps to get to. Each time the player reaches a planet, they will be faced with a 'Chance Stage', a bonus stage in which players try to destroy as many aliens as possible to accrue points. After reaching Earth, there is a Chance Stage, followed by a very fast '3 Warps to Neptune' stage. After this, the levels and the background music start over. 

Gyruss' superb gameplay, in which the player ship rotates around the edges of the screen and fires 'inwards', is heavily influenced by Atari's 1981 classic, "Tempest". While the design of the alien ships themselves is similar to those of Namco's also-legendary "Galaga" series.

- TRIVIA -

Gyruss was released in March 1983 in Japan.

After working on the successful "Time Pilot", Gyruss' designer, Yoshiki Okamoto, went on to create Gyruss, which, although a success in its own right, was released at a time when the arcade craze was starting to die down. This may explain why the game didn't shift the units it really deserved. After its release, Okamoto asked for a raise, or he would quit. He was duly fired when he turned up for work the following day. 

One of the most memorable features of this game is its soundtrack, which consists of an extremely catchy synthesized rendition of Bach's 'Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor'. 

Anthony Fodrizio holds the official record for this game with 41,090,450 points. 

A set of developer credits are hidden in the ROM, beginning at 1E9A in memory.

A bootleg of this game is known as "Venus". 

Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.1 - 28XA-85) on June 25, 1986.

A Gyruss unit appears in the music video for "Kid Candy" by the grunge rock group Seaweed.

- SCORING -

Shooting a ship: 50, 100 or 150 points. 
Destroying a whole formation of enemy ships before the next wave attacks: 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500 points. 
Bonus for clearing a sector (having not destroyed a whole formation): 1,000 points. 
Shooting the three glowing spheres: 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 points. 
Bonus for shooting each ship on the Chance Stage: 100 points. 
Bonus for shooting all 40 ships on the Chance Stage: 10,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* You can get double fire if you shoot the sun-like enemy that appears in front of you surrounded by two blue pod-like enemies - try to make this a priority.

* To make getting double fire easier, try to stay at the bottom of the screen until the 'pod and sun' formation appears as it will appear right in front of wherever your ship is after all enemies have entered and they start attacking. 
1) There must be at least three enemies left in the level for the 'pod and sun' formation to show. If you lose a life and three enemies are left, the 'pod and sun' will show up one more time, but if you lose a life after that, they will not show any more until the next level. After you get double fire, the sun enemy will be replaced on later levels with another pod. Destroy all three for some bonus points.
2) If you have only one enemy left and cannot seem to destroy it, just leave it alone and eventually it will just leave and the level will end.

* Each level begins with four formations entering. If you destroy enough of these, a fifth formation will enter. As you pass each planet, more formations will enter towards the top of the screen. Learn to control your ship at the top as it will come in real handy on those Mars and Earth warps.

* When formations enter from the edge of the screen, they will not hit you if you are right where they enter. You can use this to your advantage to take out the formation with little or no trouble - just watch out for asteroids.

* Asteroids will always appear in your path - they cannot be destroyed and must be avoided.

* The 'bee-like' creatures with the force field will always appear from the center and move outward. The force field will destroy your ship if you touch it. Destroy one of the creatures to disable their force field.

* Learn the formations of the enemy attack waves during the normal stages, to enable you to collect the bonuses for destroying whole waves of attacking ships.

* Learn the formations of the enemy attack waves during the chance stages, to enable you to collect the bonuses for destroying whole waves of attackers and the 10,000 for destroying all 40 ships.

* The three glowing spheres always appear aligned with where you are located on screen. Remember to avoid any bullets when they appear.

* You can fire bullets ahead of enemy ships and then move aside to destroy them and avoid their shots.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 37 years ago:

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (c) 1985 Atari Games Corp.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is an action games based on the movie of the same same in which the player takes on the role of action hero, Indiana Jones. Indy must infiltrate the lair of the evil Thuggee cult and their boss, Mola Ram, armed only with his trademark whip. The goal is to free the children the cult has kidnapped as slaves, recover the stolen relics known as "Sankara Stones" and escape from the temple.

The game that takes place over three different zones; the mines, a mine-cart chase and the temple. Players can choose to start the game on any one of three difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard. These are selected by entering the corresponding door.

* The first zone is made up of ledges, ladders, slides and conveyor belts. Indy must free kidnapped children by finding their cages and whipping them open. Rattlesnakes and Thuggee guards patrol the ledges and must be avoided or whipped. Players must be careful to not fall from a ledge or a life is lost. Mola Ram himself occasionally appears and throws flaming hearts at Indy, these must be whipped or avoided.

* The second zone is a recreation of the famous mine cart chase from the movie and the player must guide Indy's cart to the bottom of the mine, keeping ahead of enemy carts and avoiding dead ends and track-side enemies. The cart can be steered left and right to different tracks to avoid obstacles.

* The third zone takes place in the temple itself and Indy must make his way to the altar and retrieve the Sankara stone. Indy must avoid guards, rattlesnakes and flaming hearts thrown by Mola Ram. Once a Sankara stone has been retrieved Indy must escape the temple through one of the four doors that opens.

The zones are then repeated twice more to collect the two remaining stones, although the lay-out and difficulty of the zones is different. Once all three Sankara stones have been collected, Indy must work his way through a final mine and mine-cart section, before making his escape on a rope bridge and facing Mola Ram for the final time. 

*Note* The final rope bridge section doesn't appear if the game has been played on the 'Easy' level. Instead, a message will appear stating that Indy escaped on the rope bridge. The player is then returned to the game, starting over with a higher level of difficulty.

- TRIVIA -

Space Invaders was released by Midway Manufacturing, under license by Taito, in October 1978 in the USA.

The Space Invaders phenomenon stunned many conservative adults of the time who were convinced that video-games soured the minds of their youngsters. Residents of Mesquite, Texas, pushed the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in their efforts to ban the illicit machines from their Bible-belt community. A number of reported incidents of juvenile crime began to surface shortly after the game's release, adding to its 'controversy'. A girl was caught stealing $5,000 from her parents and gangs of youths were reported to have robbed grocery stores just so they would have money to play the game.

Of the reported 350,000 units produced world wide, about 65,000 units were produced in the U.S. alone.

Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games. According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders.

Space Invaders inspired a catchy hit song by 'Uncle Vic' called 'Space Invaders' released over the spring to summer-time period of 1980. The Pretenders also released an instrumental song called 'Space Invaders' on their debut album in 1980.

A Space Invaders unit appears in the 1980 movie 'Midnight Madness', in the 1982 movie 'Jekyll &amp; Hyde... Together Again', in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'The Iceman', in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day', and in the 1998 sitcom 'That 70's Show'; Season 4, Episode 8 (Donna's Story).

An upright unit of the Midway release of Space Invaders appears in the ZZ Top music video, 'Legs'.

		<name>Jr. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 39 years ago:

Jr. Pac-Man (c) 1983 Bally Midway.

One of many sequels to the legendary "Pac-Man", Jr. Pac-Man features the character of Pac-Man's son. For the first time in the series' history, side-scrolling mazes were introduced, with each maze being two screens wide. 

This time, the mazes have no exit tunnels through which players can make an escape. The bonus items that appear move around the maze and are now something of a mixed blessing, as not only will they destroy any Power Pills they come across, but they will also turn any normal dots they pass over into large dots that slow the player's movements considerably, but are worth more points than normal dots if eaten by the player. Any mutated dots in the maze will disappear if the player loses a life. 

The Pac character is once again pursued by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Tim) in his quest to eat all of the dots in each maze. And, as before, numerous Power Pills litter the mazes that, when eaten, allow Jr. to eat the pursuing ghosts. 

As with previous "Pac-Man" games, intermissions are featured between certain levels. Jr. Pac-Man's intermissions are episodic in nature, like those found in "Ms. Pac-Man". Jr. Pac-Man's story tells of the blossoming love between Jr. Pac-Man and a small ghost named Yum-Yum. 

Act I - Jr. Meets Yum-Yum: Jr. Pac-Man steps outside his home to play. He spots Yum-Yum beyond the fence in his yard and goes outside to meet her. Blinky, hiding in the shadows, comes out from hiding to catch Jr. However Ms. Pac-Man, keeping a watchful eye over her child, sees the commotion from her window and runs out to the yard to eat a Power Pill and chase both ghosts away while Jr. returns to the safety of home. This intermission is played after Round 1. 

Act II - The Gift: It seems that Jr. can't get the enchanting young ghost out of his mind, so he proceeds to bring a balloon to her as a gift the next day. Excited to see her, he meets her on a bridge and hands her the balloon, when we catch a glimpse of Blinky lurking behind a bush. This intermission is played after Round 3. 

Act III - They Escape: Blinky moves from one bush to the another, startling Yum-Yum into releasing the balloon. Blinky attempts to capture Jr. once and for all, but once again, Ms. Pac-Man comes to the rescue. Blinky chases her off to the left, while Jr. Pac-Man and Yum-Yum escape to the right. Once alone, they gaze in to each other's eyes and fall in love, with hearts appearing all around them. This intermission is played after Rounds 5, 7, and 9.

- TRIVIA -

Jr. Pac-Man was released on October 18, 1983 in the USA.

Jr. Pac-Man was developed by 'General Computer Corporation' (GCC) for Bally/Midway and is essentially an enhancement to "Ms. Pac-Man" (which is, in itself, an enhanced version of the original "Pac-Man"). Much of the original "Pac-Man" code is still present and even the 'GENERAL COMPUTER CORPORATION Hello, Nakamura.' message that featured in "Ms. Pac-Man" is present.

Jr. Pac-Man runs on a modified "Pac-Man" hardware, with additional horizontal scrolling support. This was the first "Pac-Man" game in which the maze is larger than the visible area; requiring the screen to scroll.

There are a number of hidden bonus objects that were never used by the developers. To see them, set 'CHEATS' to 'Always have blue ghosts'; play a game, repeatedly eat the ghosts until you get past 1,600 points. The game was coded to deal with such high bonus values and assigns a hexadecimal value to the score value after 1,600. The hexadecimal scores equate to a graphic in the game. After eating somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-30 ghosts consecutively, the hidden objects will appear. There is a rattle, a baby's dummy, a cowboy hat and a skateboard.

Abner Ashman holds the official record for this game with 1,500,000 points on February 2, 2002. In the game where he "officially" got this record, there was a power outage that shut down his game at approximately that score...and he still had not lost a man up to that point!

A bootleg of this game runs on the "Pengo" hardware.

A Jr. Pac-Man unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

MAZE STRATEGY

The first maze, which has 548 dots and six Power Pills, offers a good mix of straight-a-ways and islands. The two power pills on either side of the ghosts' den cannot be destroyed by bonuses, so try to save them for later in the stage. The ghosts move slow enough that you can plan out your strategy and wait by power pills for ghosts to gather nearby before eating them. 

The second maze has 560 dots, six Power Pills, and features more long stretches than the first maze, but there are many escape routes, so you shouldn't worry about getting trapped. Use the 'staircase' section of the maze on the far ends to put distance between you and any trailing ghosts. It's possible to 'trap' the ghosts so that you can complete a lot of the maze without them chasing you. Position Jr. to either the far left or far right hand side of the maze; thus causing the center of the maze to scroll off-screen. You should see the ghosts in the corridors above the ghosts' den; they will stay in those corridors as long as you are on either the left or right hand side of the maze. This works because the game has logic to reverse the ghosts' direction when they go off screen.

The third maze has 526 dots, six Power Pills, and features small circular sections that you should approach with caution. It can be hard to read which directions the ghosts will move in around them and lead to unavoidable collisions. By this maze, the ghosts are speeding up, so take the time to cross from one section of the maze to the other to prevent the ghosts from surrounding you. 

The fourth maze has 526 dots, six Power Pills, and features islands on the bottom that can be both helpful and harmful. They allow you multiple paths to take in order to escape from one ghost, but they also provide multiple pathways for a number of ghosts to surround you. Clear as much of the bottom sections as you can before you eat the Power Pill. Then use the Pill and eat any ghost in the area before time runs out. Then finish the section if possible before moving on. 

The fifth maze has 528 dots, six Power Pills, and features islands that are scattered throughout. Cross back and forth across the entire maze to prevent the ghosts from ganging up on you in any one section of the maze. Power pills are becoming less effective at this point. Don't sacrifice yourself trying to stop a bonus item from destroying a power pill. 

The sixth maze has many S-turns that offer the ghosts multiple opportunities to trap you from either end. Keep the ghosts behind you by crossing back and forth. To make matters worse, you only get four Power Pills instead of six. Aside from the Power Pills, there are a total of 512 dots in this maze. Don't let the bonus item transform too many of the dots into mutated dots in this maze, or you will have a harder time avoiding ghosts while being slowed down by the large dots. 

The seventh and final maze is by far the most dangerous maze to Jr.'s survival. The center is relatively safe, but the sides of the maze are deadly. There are 540 dots and only four Power Pills in this maze. The Power Pills are situated in odd corners. The far path around the outside of the maze is considerably dangerous as it is easy to get trapped trying to clear it. And the Power Pills simply aren't effective long enough to keep you safe. The smaller sections between the side Power Pills is also easy to become trapped in. Only enter if the coast looks clear, and make sure that you have an exit strategy if a ghost decides to enter this small section with you. For all of your planning, success in this maze depends on a considerable amount of luck.

After you finish the seventh maze, the mazes cycle from the fourth through the seventh in a repeating loop.

Kaiser Knuckle (c) 1994 Taito.

A one-on-one fighting game featuring nine selectable characters and three end bosses, controlled with a single joystick and six buttons. In addition to the usual kicks and punches, each character also has a number of special moves, that can be utilized via complex joystick and button combinations. In the one player game, players can chose their first opponent, with subsequent opponents chosen randomly by the game.

Unusually for a game of this type, Kaiser Knuckle features blood; something that had hitherto only been associated with Midway's "Mortal Kombat" series. The blood option can be switched off in the game's dip settings.

Kaiser Knuckle was Taito's answer to Capcom's Street Fighter II during the fighting game trend of the 90s. Despite showing highly detailed and unique content in the arcades, it didn't catch enough attention to become a success and was never ported to home consoles.

A unique feature is that this was the first and only fighting game to feature five different strength for basic punches and kicks.

Another unique feature are power zones, these are activated when landing a special move when a character's Power (Crush in the Japanese version) meter is full. Power zones contain electricity or fire that can help improve a character's special move. Stage backgrounds can also be destroyed by the combat, getting hit fills the Power meter and when a special move connects when it is full, it greatly damages the background walls and can unlock the fire or electric zones found in levels.

An updated prototype of this game is known to exists as "Dan-Ku-Ga". The project was cancelled.

Karate Blazers (c) 1991 Video System Company, Limited.

A horizontally scrolling fighting game for 1 to 4 players. Each playable character (chosen from Mark, Glen, Akira and Gil) kicks and punches their way through a number of enemy-packed levels. In addition to kicking and punching, each character also has their own unique 'special attack'; a move that injures multiple on-screen enemies at the cost of some of the player's health.

While in no way original (drawing most of its inspiration from Capcom's "Final Fight"), Karate Blazers is both hugely playable and very fast and frenetic, with the amount of on-screen enemies at times overwhelming. The graphics are also well drawn and nicely animated.

Released in August 1991 in Japan.

The boss of the 3rd stage is inspired by Sato, a character of the movie 'Black Rain' (directed by Ridley Scott and acted by Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia). Sato was interpreted by the Japanese actor Yusaku Matsuda, died shortly after the movie was made. Even the stage when you fight the boss (the factory) seems somehow inspire from the movie's background (in a movie's scene, Nick - interpreted by Michael Douglas - try to defeat Sato in a steelworks, quite similar to the game's stage).

Karnov's Revenge (c) 1994 Data East Corp.

The quest to defeat the mysterious Baron of Battlers, the mysterious "K", is on. In order to get to this grotesque gladiator, you need to fight your way through 13 with the most skilled, most deadly of all combatants in the world of physical contact. Use your powers of pulverization, psychic energy blasts, and ridiculous strength to become the explosive fighting god in FIGHTER'S HISTORY DYNAMITE!!!

Don't just participate in history, MAKE IT! The sequel of the first "Fighter's History", this time ported in the Neo Geo MVS Hardware. In this new version of the original game several changes and improvements were made to enhance the gameplay: now the battles are faster and more technical, with the usual friendly combo system that makes the fight so spectacular. There are also some powerful hidden moves added for most of the characters. Even the graphic was slightly enhanced, with a nice color palette and some wonderful backgrounds (especially Zazie's).

The game actually suffered from the reputation to be a 'SFII clone' given by the general opinion from the first episode. Thanks to this new chapter of the saga, which was particularly appreciated by the Neo Geo fans because it is one of the rare 'SFII style' beat'em ups on the Neo Geo this changed.

A really nice and classical beat'em up, still worthy to be played, especially for the real fans of the 2-D beat'em up.

Karnov's Revenge was released March 17, 1994. An important fact about this game is that it's the third Data East game to be manufactured on the Neo-Geo hardware.

This game is known in Japan and USA as "Fighter's History Dynamite" while in Europe as Karnov's Revenge.

New features and changes of the game:
* The controls discard the six button system of the first episode for the typical four buttons of the Neo Geo pad. In this way, the middle punch and middle kick attack are no longer available.
* New stages for every character and new background music.
* The portrait of every character was retouched a bit. Especially, the portraits of FeiLin and Karnov were both redrawn.
* New color schemes for the alternative suit's color of every character. However, the standard suit color of all the characters is still the same as that of the first Fighter's History episode.
* New vocal samples for every characters, except for Clown, Karnov and Mizoguchi: however, for Mizoguchi new samples for the win poses and a new 'scream of defeat' was added (in the first Fighter's History, when Mizoguchi lost, she emitted the generic KO sample shared with other characters).
* The in-game sprites of every character were retouched slightly in some determinate frames. 
* The design of Karnov was redrawn from the first episode.
* Faster gameplay. 
* New moves and new tricks for every character.
* New endings for every character. Even Clown and Karnov now have their own ending sequence.

The stage of Marstorius takes place in a ring placed inside the Colosseum of Rome.

The three children in the middle of the Samchay's stage are the two little brothers and sister of Samchay.

The extra round against the bull named 'Ox' (see TIPS AND TRICKS section to learn more) is a retrieval to the similar bonus game in "Karate Champ" (one of the first fighting games of the history, developed by same Data East on 1984).

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Fighter's History Dynamite &amp; Flying Power Disc - PCCB-00149) on March 18, 1994.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Karnov's Revenge introduced 'one-two attacks' to the series. Players can press a Strong attack button while connecting with a Weak attack button to chain the attacks into themselves.

The following special moves aren't listed in the instruction manual. These secret moves aren't super moves, just hidden special moves with less obvious motions. Samchay, Clown, and Karnov do not have these moves. Here's a quick legend: U=Up, D=Down, B=Back, F=Forward, DF=Down/Forward, and so on. A=Button A (LP), B=Button B (HP), C=Button C (LK), D=Button D (HK). Charge=Hold listed direction for 2 or more seconds

RAY
Thunder Dynamite Tackle: Charge B, F, F + A or B (Initial backward charge is longer than normal)

* If you beat the game without losing a single round you'll get an extra secret fight against a bull (Ox).

* Weak Points: The Weak Points and the relates dizzy system remained the same of the first episode. Thus, heavy hits will flash the weak point (determinate part of the suit of the character) and after a while further hits taken will make fly away the weak point with a BOING! sound and the character will get dizzy.

ケツイ ～絆地獄たち～ (c) 2003 Cave.
(Ketsui - Kizuna Jigoku-tachi)

The continuous industrialization that started in 1900, finally led to unavoidable consequences in the middle of the 21st century. The waterlevel rose worldwide and threatened many coastal countries. So the shorelines had to be modified In order to save the human civilization from drowning. It was a time of great confusion about the future, and nobody thought about war. Well, almost... There was one company called EVAC corporation, who made a great profit from underhand productions and exports of weapon systems. When the United Nations discovered their illegal trades, they pointed EVAC to the global ban of weapon imports and exports, and asked them to stop their productions and to destroy their weapon facilities immediately. EVAC rejected all accusations and refused to take any actions. So a preventive war was started by the United Nations to stop the EVAC corporation.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* High Scoring: The key to high scoring is moving up close (VERY close) to your enemies and blasting them for point boxes labeled 1 through 5 (Five is worth the most, of course).

* Lock-Shot Properties: With Lock-Shot active your helicopter will move slower. You start with 2 pods, one on each side of the helicopter. each can lock onto a target. After powering up twice you will gain 2 more pods (total of 4) and have the ability to lock onto four separate targets. Usually you just have all pods lock onto one target for max damage. You do NOT do more damage closer to enemies. However, when closer, you lock on faster, and less enemies will be in the way of your pods and the target, so you will end up dealing more. Your Helicopter will shoot a beam out in front. It CANNOT reach full screen! You will see it end at about 3/4 from the bottom. The Beam DOES do damage, albeit very little, but it can add up. Lock-Shot will lock onto enemies quicker the closer you are. It will not let go until you release A or the target is destroyed. During Boss Battles, it is quicker to hold C, wait just until the Boss can be damaged, then hold down A. You have to be close for this. Enemies will drop more Chips when Lock-Shot mode is active. You must get in the habit of keeping Lock-Shot HELD DOWN even after an enemy is destroyed, because there are several that will continue to drop boxes even after death or explode multiple times.

* The Score Bar:
- 1st Row: Multiplier Overall Counter. Multiplier used in [after] the boss fight. It's the total sum of all chips gathered up until the boss fight. Unless you die, it will not deplete until the boss fight.
- 2nd Row: Multiplier Counter (1-999). 
Multiplier used in stage. Grows as you gather Multiplier Chips, but depletes as you use your lock shot, and if you die.
- Multiplier Chip Rate: The type of chip you get when you kill enemies with the lock shot. When the Multiplier timer reaches 0, it'll be reset when you kill an enemy with your normal shot, and is valid until the timer reaches 0.
- 3rd Row: Current chip NUMBER (1-5). Measures the time the chip rate is valid. Will rise as you kill enemies with the shot or lock shot, but the chip rate will return to 1 when the timer hits zero. The multiplier is raised as you gather multiplier chips. Basically you need to remember that killing an enemy at close distance produces are larger chip. Conversely, what depletes the multiplier is destroying enemies with the lock shot. Depending on the type of enemy, they can take off up to 1/30 to 1/10 of the entire value (popcorn enemies deplete it by a small amount, whereas bosses deplete it by a large one). If you die, it will decrease by 1/4.
- Characteristics of the multiplier at the boss fight: Unlike points 1 and 2, during the boss fight, the value of the overall multiplier counter is applied straight up. However, there's few chances to raise it during the boss fight, and it will quickly deplete as time passes. Certain bosses are better to ignore their parts and just kill quickly.

* End of Level Bonus = TOTAL CHIPS AQUIRED x (LIVES x 500 points + BOMBS X 50 points)

* Boss form change timing: you want your bullets from Shot to destroy the boss, but be able to get into Lock-Shot mode. I get the bosses life bar just a bit before the form change. You must get the feel.
These are for 1P.
&gt; 1st Boss: between N and S of INSERT COIN
&gt; 2nd Boss: between S and E of INSERT COIN
&gt; 3rd Boss: the 1P score in the middle of the 100s place
&gt; 4th Boss: First Form: Between N and S of INSERT COIN. Second Form: The 1P score between 1000 and 100.
&gt; 5th Boss: First Form: There is no marking to indicate, if you constantly damage him with Lock-Shot, it is when he returns to his first pattern. Second Form: The 1P score at about 10,000. I don't look at this, it is during the second time of his final attack.

* Loops requirements:
- NORMAL "TSUUJOU" LOOP - Total DEATHS + BOMBS =&gt; 6
&gt; Instead of releasing chips, enemies release Suicide bullets.
&gt; Suicide Bullets are PINK.
&gt; Chip Number is ALWAYS 1.
&gt; You can stop suicide bullets from being released (seal) by being within a certain radius of enemies.
&gt; If suicide bullets are sealed, then no chips are gained.
&gt; Difficulty is drastically increased.

- SPECIAL "URA" LOOP (AKA REVERSE LOOP/SIDE) - NO MISS/NO BOMBS, 120+ Million Score
&gt; A text message is given "WELCOME TO THE SPECIAL ROUND" before starting.
&gt; Suicide bullets are BLUE.
&gt; There is a greater number of suicide bullets and they are quicker.
&gt; The distance which you can seal suicide bullets is decreased.
&gt; When suicide bullets are sealed, the number that was due to be discharged will be added to your multiplier (I will figure it out exactly as I get there)
&gt; The rate of decrease when an enemy is destroyed with lock-shot is decreased.
&gt; During Boss Battles, the reduction speed of the Total Multiplier Overall Counter is slowed.
&gt; End of round bonus DOUBLES.
&gt; During the 5th Boss, after the second form is destroyed, DOOM will appear.

It means that this game have been developed by Taito Kumagaya (kuma + tani) Laboratory. And if you start the game when these characters are displayed,  on life is added to your play (3 by default, the game should start with 4 lives).

* Wave a flag at a lamp post with a red orb inside it and you will get a powerup.

* There are several types of letters or messages :
White - increase range
Red - increse firepower
Yellow - big letters

* You can also pick up 'eggs' along the way. These eggs are activated by hitting fire &amp; flag at the same time.
Blue - freezes all monsters for a given period of time, also those off screen.
Yellow - kill everything on screen.

* The 'gremlins' don't kill you but they slow you down. You can lose them by running around a lamppost.

		<name>King &amp; Balloon</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 42 years ago:

King &amp; Balloon (c) 1980 Namco.

The player controls two green men (likely soldiers in the king's army) with an orange cannon that fires at squads of descending balloons. You must protect the King and prevent him from being captured and carried away by one of the balloons. Unlike most shooter games, the player's cannon can be hit and destroyed any number of times; it is the King that must be protected. The game ends when the king is carried away three times.

- TECHNICAL -

Main CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)
Sound CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 2.5 Mhz)
Sound Chips: Tone generator, discrete circuits, and a DAC for speech

Control: 2-way joystick
Buttons: 1 (FIRE)

- TRIVIA -

King &amp; Balloon was released by Namco in October 1980 in Japan and by GamePlan in December 1980 in the USA.

King &amp; Balloon is the first game from Namco to feature voices.

Kevin Olkowski holds the official record for this game with 48900 points.

- UPDATES -

The voices differed between Japanese and U.S. versions. In the Japanese version, the abducted king yelled 'Help! Help!', but with heavy Japanese pronunciation, sounding more like 'Herupuu!'. In the U.S. version, the voice was redone as a more English-sounding 'Help!'.

- SCORING -

On single balloons, first score is in formation, second score diving or rising, third score is rising with King in tow.
Red Balloons: 50, 100, 150
Orange Balloons: 40, 80, 120
Yellow Balloons: 30, 60, 90
White balloons: 20, 40, 60

On combination balloons, first score is first hit, second score is second hit, third score is third hit. First color is balloon color, second color is line/gondola color
Red/White: 500, 1,000, 1,500
Orange/Yellow: 400, 600, 1,000
Yellow/Orange: 300, 500, 700
White/Red: 200, 300, 500

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* A player can easily top 100,000 or more on this game using two basic tactics: maximizing the points available, and ensuring the cannon is always best placed to destroy any balloon that grabs the king. Since all cannons are expendable, success often depends on their deliberate tactical destruction.

* Keep an eye out for the giant balloon. These balloons are worth more point than regular balloons. Shooting it once makes it become a medium-sized balloon, and shooting it a second time reverts it back to being a normal balloon. 

* Giant balloons never appear by themselves - there will always be at least one small balloon on the screen at the same time. As soon as you see a giant balloon start to form, let a normal balloon destroy your cannon as soon as possible. This should give you enough grace time when you reappear to fire three shots at the giant balloon for 3000 points, and then position yourself correctly if there is a balloon attempting to abduct the king. It is possible to destroy 5 or 6 giant balloons by per level, gaining you around 20,000 points.

* Try to keep the level going as long as possible unless you're down to your last 6  balloons -  at this point giant balloons rarely from.

* Just like Galaxian, the game only goes up to round 48. If round 48 is completed, the game will continue to work but will always report the level as 48.

- TRIVIA -

Released in July 2000.

About Ramon: This character was designed with one of Neo-Geo's major markets in mind, South America. He's a stout, masked wrestler who uses tricky body slam moves. These 3 points form the major concept behind the creation of Ramon. Ramon's designer at the time loved pro-wrestling fighting moves, and we remember him carefully studying these. The fruits of this labor crystallized themselves in the Lucha Dolore known as Ramon. With his use of 'Lucha Libre' moves and not those of traditional 'pro-wrestling', the staff team hope you can enjoy experiencing the attention to detail, intensity, and enthusiasm of Ramon's designer at that time.

About Vanessa: Vanessa's entrance in KOF at the time put a stop to the parade of increasingly younger characters appearing in the game, especially the women characters who were all teenagers for the most part. This is the reason for creating the concept of a thirty-something woman who broke all the rules and overflowed with adult appeal. Her style has become the topic of many humorous comic strips. In her first appearance in the Sega Dreamcast version of KOF '99 as a Striker character, she was a bit irreverent. And in KOF 2000, she officially entered the tournament as a player character. Designers wanted to introduce her as a player character in KOF '99, but legend has it that she had to sit it out due to certain time constraints.

About Lin: This character was selected out of the encyclopedic character background materials (whose volume would rival the Encyclopedia Britannica!) of the supervising planners. Lin is tied to the Flying Brigands 'HIzoku', who were introduced as a KOF side story in the NESTS Chronicles, but without the knowledge of the staff, and when Ron showed up in the ending sequence, there were some awfully surprised designers. With all the special moves and actions for this character the programmers and planners had a rough time working on this character. He brought tears to the eyes of the developers, but not for the usual reasons.

About Seth: Seth was created as part of a set with Vanessa, appearing for the first time in the Sega Dreamcast version of KOF '99. His initial name was 'Dick'. The name had deep significance for his designer. Based on the strong wishes of the supervising designer, the powerful image of a big, dark, middle-aged man with a Mohawk haircut who used the arts of self-defense was decided on. Since Seth was created first, Vanessa's clothes were designed to match his. This made some people surmise things like Seth was Vanessa's husband.

About Hinako Shijo: At first designers sought to create a character similar to Chie in the Japanese comic Jarinko Chie (Downtown Story) who used sumo moves. The supervising designer, however, succumbed to insistent requests to use 'a debutante', and Hinako gradually transformed into a wellborn young maiden. She was to fight barefoot, but that idea got eighty-sixed. The tape remaining on her fingers is a tiny remnant of her original concept. Since her appearance grew further and further away from that of a sumo wrestler, the names for her moves use those of actual sumo moves to preserve the essence of the sumo wrestler in her original character.

About Kula Diamond: To add dimensions to the villainous NESTS organization of the NESTS Chronicles and excitement to the story, the need to create an enemy for the huge and individualistic K' arose. Manipulator of the 'Anti-K' Arts', her ice symbolizes the foil to the flames of K'. That's what Kula Diamond's all about. During production Designers elicited the opinions of newly hired female designers regarding Kula's mannerisms to "make her girlish gestures appropriately girlish" (but left the actual design work to the veteran supervising designer). Designers think we succeeded in faithfully depicting a 14-year-old girl... Asking Kula's designer about his impressions at the time, he immediately answered: "Kula had an easy delivery. She didn't give me any pain". The actual work appeared difficult, but it seems he enjoyed his work.

About Candy Diamond: Candy is the robot you can see during Kula's Special Move displays, animated sequences, and as a Striker. Since Candy's not a player character she doesn't stand out like the other characters, but she does appear in the gut-wrenching episode that depicts her emotions for Kula when she's torched saving her mistress in the Kula ending of KOF 2000. If you haven't yet seen this, what're you waiting for? Hurry up and clear the game with Kula to find out!

About Zero: Zero is the boss of Krizalid from KOF '99, but his position in a company would be similar to that of 'division chief'. Because of his black beard and noble manner, designers are sure he's regarded as a rather scary 'division chief' in the organization. His guiltless betrayal of Krizalid speaks volumes about his true personality, in stark contrast to his dislike of traitors listed in his profile. Incidentally, The names of some of Zero's moves come from the Japanese anime 'Hokuto no Ken'.

About Diana: Diana's the Amazon featured in Kula's sequences. She used to be a top executive for NESTS but is portrayed as Kula's guardian in the background story. If you compared NESTS to a company... designers often use this metaphor, but designers don't have a clue which position would fit her or Foxy. Judging by her loathing of elite managers (college boys), designers could say she's a 'big-sister section chief' who climbed the corporate ladder with extremely hard work. Working with a "fabulous babe" boss like her would be whack (but a bit scary, though)!

Robert's 'Ryuugeki Ken' is a knock-off of the Sonic Boom (It isn't in "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle" because of its looks, despite the charging motion).

There are 2 symbolic things that tell you how the people at SNK were forseeing the end of their company. Kyo's theme is called 'Good Bye Esaka', Esaka is the avenue where the SNK building and Neo Geo Land are (Esaka means 'entrance to the hill'). The second thing is the destruction of the city that started all: South Town (Home of "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting" - however, note that in "Garou - Mark of The Wolves", Second South was rebuilt near South Town. Also noted is the fact that every Kyo theme before 'Tears' had 'Esaka' in it ('Esaka' in 94, 'Funky Esaka' in 95, 'Esaka?' in 96 and 'Esaka Forever' in 97).
The reason for those names is that in "The King of Fighters '94", Kyo's team stage is below a bridge in the Esaka area near SNK. In "The King of Fighters '95", they fight in front of Neo Geo Land, again, in Esaka in front of the SNK building. In "The King of Fighters '96", they fight in top of a bridge also in the Esaka area. In "The King of Fighters '97" there is no Esaka stage, however, this was supposed to be the last KOF as SNK planned to move to the Hyper NeoGeo 64, it was like a glorious farewell to KOF, however, things went different. Finally, in "The King of Fighters '98 - The Slugfest", the Esaka stage appears again; they fight below a bridge in front of the Neo Geo Land.

The King of Fighters 2001 (c) 2001 Eolith.

With the largest KOF lineup totaling at 40 characters, newcomers Eolith do a great job at delivering high quality fighting action along with one of the most difficult pairs of bosses in fighting game history!

- TRIVIA -

Released in October 2001.

A hack of this game is known as "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 2003".

About Ron: the planners at the time enthusiastically came up with the idea of the Flying Brigands, the idea being to add a thrilling side story to KOF. Ron became the chief of this bunch. His first appearance came in the ending sequence for Benimaru's Team in KOF 2000. This ending sequence got first-rate reviews for its content and presentation, becoming one of the most popular episodes in the history of KOF. From KOF 2000 on, the background story became more complex on various levels, but subsequently SNK had a few problems (sniff, sniff) causing Ron's creators (the planners at the time) to go their different ways... Whenever the current staff who continue to work on KOF run into the original staff on the train to work, they are sure to grill them about Ron's background (thanks for your cooperation, by the way!). As a result of all this, he made a grand entrance as the boss characters' Striker in KOF 2001. The numerous characters who were involved with him, too, continue their exploits in the world of KOF even now. Ron is a character who uses the tricky actions from Chinese boxing and he continues work on reaching his ghoulish objective to be able to manipulate the dead. Just when he'll be able to appear as a player character is a mystery even to us...

About May Lee: one reason of existence for May came from a consideration of the needs of our Korean fans. In addition to that, Eolith, a sponsor at the time, expressed their desire for a character like a 'Korean Athena'.  This request asked for an 'idol-like visual fighter', or something along that line, and designers recall that it really threw us for a loop. Through trial and error, designers arrived at a character that was a long way from the original concept, but with this process May Lee, the perky tae kwon do fighter for justice, was born. Designers got her name from the person who was in charge of Eolith (Eolith Co., Ltd.) at the time.

About Foxy: Rumor has it that a lot of fans think Foxy died in KOF 2001, but she's alive and well (LAUGH). Initially there were no plans for her to become a player character, but her presence was needed as the story developed and she got the go-ahead. Originally Foxy was to be a character spun off from Diana, but it seems the plan just didn't work. In the end there just wasn't enough time; the graphics were worked out with great effort, but she got the boot as a result of time constraints.

About K9999: K9999 is Eolith's homage to Tetsuo from Akira. His voice actor also did Tetsuo. For various reasons K9999 is a scary character to deal with. Of course he's based on 'you know who' and has, well, similarities that we're happy a certain 'you know who' didn't object to. If you count the similarities between 'you know who' and the other 'you know who', you'd be counting from now to St. Swithun's Day. K9999 boasts a big following of fans in Korea and Japan, but no other character has such obstacles against him appearing in KOF again.

About Angel: Angel was realized through the overwhelming passion of her designer (LAUGH). You could say that there was just no stopping him. You can see his preferences in almost every aspect of her. She's a real rascal who has a lot of special moves like the 'Unchained Circle' and is one tough customer to deal with. Designers splurged on the voice for Angel in KOF 2001 and hired Mina Tominaga, a famous Japanese voice actress. Angel's designer was quite pleased with that...

About Zero (The Original): the supervising designer was dissatisfied with KOF 2000's Zero so he struggled with his disappointment and completed this character. Must have been that little mustache (LAUGH). And the character of Glaugan (King Lion) at his side also got nixed and wasn't used in KOF 2000 either. Talk about not getting your way! Along with polishing Zero, he was tortured with mission to realize his first boss character after leaving SNK that surpassed Krizalid's presence and strength.

About Igniz: since all designer's sponsor had to say to us-about 100 times-about Igniz was "make him hot", "make him hot", and "make him hot", Designers made him, well, a real stud. The standards for handsome characters in fighting games for Asian fans are exacting; and there is a tendency for people here to shy away from ugly and comic characters. Designer think he serves so well as a foil, the lead character comes off all the better.

Yuri's battle start pose is a knock-off of Felicia's battle start pose in "Vampire Savior - The Lord Of Vampire". Besides this, Yuri has the special attack of Gouki, the one that grabs your opponent and then the screen turns black as he gives you 30 hits in 3 seconds. This move is called the 'Yuri Chou Enbu' (means 'Yuri Super Flame Dance'). The move can only be made with the special gauge at max (with at least 1 striker - The sequence is: A, A Forward, B, C). Yuri will get Gouki's 'Messatsu' pose if you finish your opponent with it. It's a parody of Gouki's super finish splash screen (the one with the kanji 'ten' on it when he finishes his opponent with the Shun Goku Satsu).

Athena, in one of her win poses, dances about and says 'Yattai!' in a very familiar way... She's parodying Chun-Li!

The little kid that appears in Terry Bogard's win poses is none other than a young Rock Howard from "Garou - Mark of The Wolves". Since Garou takes place in 2008, Rock is still a young kid in training during this game.

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

The King of Fighters 2002 - Challenge to Ultimate Battle (c) 2002 Playmore Corp.

The King of Fighters 2002: Challenge to Ultimate Battle is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players and is the ninth game in the series.

The game discarded the 4-on-4 "Striker Match" format used in the previous three games in the series and returned to the 3-on-3 Battle format used prior to "King of Fighters '98".

The King of Fighters 2002 also revamped the Power Gauge system into a format similar to the one used in KOF '97. As with previous games in the series, the Power Gauge is filled as the player attacks their opponent or performs Special Moves. The number of Power Gauges the player can stock up is increased by one with each member of the team. For example, the first member of the team can stock up to three Power Gauges, while the third member can stock up to five. 

A single Power Gauge stock can be used to either perform a Counter-attack and evasion technique while guarding against an opponent's attack, to use a Super Special Move, or to initiate the MAX Activation state. The same case also applies to the 1-on-1 format, in which the Power Gauge the player can stock up is also increased by one with each round loss (for example, on the first round, the player can stock up to three Power Gauges, while losing two rounds allows the player to stock up to five).

During MAX Activation, the player's offensive and defensive strength is increased for a short period. In this state, a Super Special Move can be used without consuming Power Gauge stock. There are also MAX Super Special Moves, which are Super moves that can only be performed during MAX Activation with one Power Gauge stock, and MAX2 moves, that require two stocks while low on health.

Developed by Eolith Co., Ltd.

Released in October 2002.

About Kusanagi: As the NESTS Chronicles began, Kyo's school uniform changed to a white outfit but his trademark was his black school uniform (even though he's over 20!). Because of some desired the return of the old Kyo, he was inserted into the game at the last moment. In KOF 2003, KUSANAGI was treated as phantom that Chizuru produced with the power of the Mirror of the Yata. But you can't have Kyo without a school uniform. Maybe in Chizuru's mind Kyo will always be a high school student.

About Orochi Yashiro: The characters commonly referred to as Shadow Yashiro, Shadow Shermie, and Shadow Chris were first formulated to balance out the Japan Team of Kyo, Benimaru, and Daimon. Needless to say, Yashiro was 'a character who used powerful body slams associated with the earth and earthquakes' in the same vein Daimon did. He's a dynamic guy who doesn't fret over tiny details, but his hobby is playing guitar in his band. The band's name has never been officially revealed, but it is known as 'C.Y.S.' He idolizes the guitarist Paul Gilbert, and has quite a detailed background story to him.

About Orochi Shermie: If Yashiro offsets Daimon, Shermie is Benimaru's counterpart who ''manipulates lightning and thunderclap attacks''. But the supervising planner made sure, through trial and error, Shermie would simply not become a ''female Benimaru''. Various ideas were added to make her a new, unique character. The ''Moonless Thundercloud'' Shermie heaves up with a belch is an example of this, as is the ''Willow Whip'' move she uses to mow down opponents with flailing arms. Incidentally, these moves were called the ''Explosive Belch'' and the ''Back off, You Beasty'' moves during development.

About Orochi Chris: Chris, of course, is Kyo's counterpart, 'a manipulator of flame'. At the inception of production, the plan was for Chris to use the 'Flame of Darkness (Black Flame)', but the black flames were hard to see so the designers settled for purple ones. When it came time to name Chris's arsenal of moves, we remember the director saying, 'The Dark Orochi Wave sounds good'. But other planners objected: 'It's dumb for an Orochi character to have 'Orochi Wave' as a move name. It's like saying, Call me Mr. Chris'. Regardless, the director won out.

The little kid that appears in Terry Bogard's win poses is none other than a young Rock Howard from "Garou - Mark of The Wolves". Since Garou takes place in 2008, Rock is still a young kid in training during this game.

KOF2002 contains pieces of music from older KOFs. Here's a complete list of themes, the teams (or individuals) they belong to and the games they were taken from:
Tears (Kyo Kusanagi) - "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle" (Kyo Kusanagi's theme music).
Kurikinton (Fatal Fury Team) - "Fatal Fury 2" (Terry Bogard's theme music).
Beauty &amp; The Beast (Art of Fighting Team) - "The King of Fighters 2000" (Art of Fighting Team's theme music).
Jungle Bouncer (Ikari Team) - "The King of Fighters '94" (Ikari Team's theme music).
Psycho Soldier (Athena Asamiya) - "Psycho Soldier" (what part of the game?).
Diet (Gals Fighters Team) - "Art of Fighting 2" (Yuri Sakazaki's theme music).

- TRIVIA -

Released in November 2003, KOF2k3 represents the latest opus in the series to run on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.

Two new systems have been adopted: 'Tactical Leader System' which sets up a leader favorably treated in capability in a team and 'Multi-Shift' in which player characters can be changed freely during 3 on 3 battle.

About Ash Crimson: Unlike the usual KOF hero characters, Ash was designed with the intent to create an 'attractive evil character'. Because the supervising designer created a rough design that fit the desired appearance to a 'T', little was changed for this character's design. Incidentally, the team story quotes casually from Robert Browning's 'Spring Song', but no one on the staff took interest in this (Boo hoo). And the bit about Shanghai Crabs was the original material for the character 'Rojin'.

About Duo Long: When speaking of the Flying Brigands, you have quite a collection of especially unique-looking characters, but Duo Long is, unlike those of his ilk so far, an orthodox, handsome character. The model for this character is a certain Romanian vampire and hunter with the same first letter for his name. A subtly embroidered dragon is depicted on the back of Duo Lon's costume, but according to the illustration's supervising designer Falcoon, this character sports a detailed character that follows the steady work of traditional craftsmen with the scales drawn one at a time...

About Shen Woo: The first concept for this character was a wild and sexy guy. The development codename for him was ''The Third Man'', and along those lines he became Woo Shen, his name 'flip-flopping' to the current name, and the latter moniker seemed to stick. Because Ash has his particular appearance (LAUGH), Shen, no matter how you look at it, appears more like the main character. His character closely resembles certain aspects of Ralf and Yashiro in many ways, so designers toiled to create distinctive moves for this character. According to the supervising designer, 'What knotted my stomach most was the shortness of time we had for development'.

About Tizoc: To tell the truth, Raiden was to appear in KOF 2003, but before the characters were finally decided on, Tizoc took his place. Along with the change to KOF 2003's game system, designers were able to create movements heretofore impossible with KOF until now, allowing us to add the style of Tizoc for that very reason. It's unclear whether there were plans or not to introduce Grant from "Garou - Mark of the Wolves" along with Tizoc for a friendly tag team battle. It may not be very well known, but the Japanese name for Tizoc is 'Griffon Mask'. But we felt Tizoc for the English version had a nice ring to it.

About Gato: Keeping the demands of the Chinese market in mind, designers included a user of orthodox Chinese boxing in the game to follow our marketing plans and enter the battle with Tizoc from "Garou - Mark of the Wolves". Halfway through the development process, he became the character that was busy getting burned, frozen, and slapped around with a giant metal ball by other characters to experiment with the overhauled program. When Gato appeared, many groundless rumors circulated that 'Hotaru had made a comeback' and other such rumors to the same. Whatever command you enter, be aware that Hotaru Futaba is nowhere to be found in KOF 2003, and Gato is here to stay!

About Malin: KOF 2003 saw the absence of Choi Bounge, so why not make a nimble and cute girl character?! And with that sentiment, Malin was born. It took quite an effort to arrive at the initial design for this character, but when we entered the actual work for KOF 2003, the creation of this character was a piece of cake. In the appearance sequence, the supervising designer poured his sincerity into the transformation scene. But the Arcadia magazine realized that she wasn't included in their feature articles and regretted their mistake. If you consider our preferences, designers insisted on the spelling for this character to be 'Malin' and not 'Marin'. This is the humble preference of the supervising designer and a mystery to us all.

About Maki Kagura: If the younger sister Chizuru Kagura is the stork, the elder sister Maki Kagura's name comes from the tortoise (storks live a thousand years, but tortoises live 10,000). The background story for these two twins comes from KOF '96, but with their appearance in KOF 2003, some designers suggested Maki's hair be shortened to distinguish her from her kid sister. She appears in KOF 2003 as she always does (Her bangs are slightly different, however, so people who have confidence in their powers of observation, beware!). For the location test of KOF 2003, many players who defeated Chizuru were vanquished by the awesome elder sister Maki. So the fate of players was often decided with the appearance of Maki-you just don't mess around with this character!

About Adelheid: To widen the worldview of KOF with the desire to add a separate story to the main tale, designers added this character devised as a set with her kid sister Rose. Designers think many picked up on this, but Adelheid is a common female name among Swiss and Germans, and is the name from which the diminutive of Heidi's derives. In the Adelheid stage of KOF 2003, the soundtrack begins with Chopin's 'Revolutionary Etude', but including something like this on the NEO-GEO system required a huge amount of memory which overwhelmed the voice data of other characters. Designers believe it was worth it, but producers may have dissed the supervising designers of other characters in the process.

About Rose: If Hinako was the modern, unconventional 'na?f', Rose is the classic 'sophisticate' character. She has an overpowering sense of pride and high-handedness. She's also selfish and moody. If things don't go her way, watch out! But she's a real babe and not only that, she's rich! (Laugh). The voice actor for Rose also worked on Malin and Maki Kagura. Because she had a tough schedule providing the voice for three characters in one day, she was really put through a tough trial. The staff regrets this and gives their thanks from the bottom of the ocean.

About Mukai: With the belief that a fighting game boss 'must be easy to understand', designers adopted the 'ability to fossilize' to give impact to Mukai's presence. Designers then matched the design of this character to this ability. So as far as the procedure of development is concerned, Mukai was quite an unorthodox creation. The concept and design came off without a hitch, but arriving at his name was a difficult process. He's among the first of the KOF series boss characters who would be graced with the Japanese honorific of '-san'.

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

Scitron Digital Content released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters 2003 Original Sound Trax - SCDC-00337) on 24/04/2004.

- TRIVIA -

Released in August 1994.

The King of Fighters (or KOF for short) revolutionized the fighter genre with the introduction of 3 member team fighting called the 'team battle system', and by combining elements of two of SNK's existing fighting game in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting", as well as bringing back characters from games predating the MVS in "Ikari Warriors" and "Psycho Soldier". A new game in the series is produced every year.

At the demo previous to the first Rugal encounter, Rugal shows your team the statues he has gathered by turning his opponents into them. One of the statues is of a guy that looks a lot like Capcom's Guile making a Sonic Boom. Capcom later confirmed that it was indeed Guile's statue in "Capcom Vs. SNK - Millenium Fight 2000". When Guile fights Rugal that statue is shown and later destroyed by Guile.

Kyo Kusanagi: Since Kyo was created as a snazzy character capable of holding his own against the main characters of "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting", coming up with the right design was quite a lengthy undertaking. Kyo's personality remained a mystery until the final stages of development. Originally, he was to be called 'Sho Kirishima', but during the latter stages of development, his designers decided on the name of Kyo Kusanagi, and Sho got a rapid name change. The setting for the Orochi Saga, in which we learn that Kyo's ancestors defeated the Orochi of the Yamata, began with this game.

Benimaru Nikaido: This character was loosely based on a comic book character (Jean-Pierre Polnaref from "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure"), and even after the name of Benimaru was decided on, game developers gave the poor guy an identity crisis by continuing to call him by the comic book character's name. The voice for this character, too, had a peculiar bent to it, and when Benimaru's designer heard his creation's victory line of 'Thank you' recited for the first time, rumor has it that he couldn't work for days after: the reading had nothing to do with the character's original image. His speech patterns have led some to question Benimaru's preferences as far as certain lifestyles are concerned.

Goro Daimon: This character comes from the designers' desire to create a judo athlete who uses dynamic body tosses. His initial designs incurred the criticism of some fellow designers who were of the opinion that it was just plain loopy for Daimon to fight wearing Japanese geta (wooden clogs), but Goro's creators were adamant and he kept his footwear. The suggestions for his laconic victory lines and the sound of an explosion when Goro is victorious also stuck.

Terry Bogard: When the concept for KOF was first formulated, Terry was tacked on to the roster as an afterthought, but his popularity skyrocketed! He became the character who got the designers' utmost attention, and they fretted over various aspects of his character. In the first KOF, Terry became the powerhouse, getting a super punch cancel move added to his arsenal and becoming the fearsome character he is today.

Andy Bogard: Compared to Andy's original form ("Fatal Fury - King of Fighters"), Andy changed little in his move to KOF, but what he got in return was the addition of his Ultra Disruptor move to his arsenal of moves. When first added, it boasted overwhelming power: it was easy to use, never missed, trumped other moves, and annihilated all opponents.

Joe Higashi: Joe is a character who underwent a major image makeover from his transition from "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters". The victory pose of KOF '94 initially lacked the toothy smile we're familiar with now. It was quite a thorn in the side that we felt inappropriate for Joe's legion of fans. So, in rethinking the original design, we added the pearly whites that makes Joe to loveable character he is today.

Ryo Sakazaki: Ryo (as can be said of all characters from "Art of Fighting") has so many Special Moves that it seems almost unfair to the other characters, and in the designing stage, the Art of Fighting team tended to be the strongest. The designers focused on adjusting this imbalance without taking out any moves, but in the end Ryo and his team remain the toughest competitors.

Robert Garcia: Overall, KOF's characters are fit and trim, but compared to their original concepts, Robert is the slimmest of them all. Matched up against Kensou, he chide his adversary in Japanese with an Osaka accent, allowing players to enjoy the amusing word play that Osaka comedians are known for.

Takuma Sakazaki: Since the Takuma of "Art of Fighting 2" closely resembled Daimon, he received a karate tunic in his ensemble to set him apart and that's why he looks the way he does today. He originally had a combo attack after the 'Super Shrike Gale' move that appeared to be a glitch. Hence, during game development, this move was taken out, but the game designers thought that he just wasn't Takuma without this move and it was put back in. The designers slightly regret their decision because Takuma's become quite a mean little bugger as a result.

Yuri Sakazaki: Yuri is a disciple of Kyokugen Karate but her appearances in the KOF series are frequently as a member of the women fighters' team. Originally in KOF '94 there was no such team and production began on King Billy Big Bear as the English team. But "Art of Fighting 2" was completed at that time and the designers pressed to put Yuri into KOF, replacing her with Big Bear, who was presenting various problems, for various reasons (hah, hah) concerning capacity. Enter Yuri, goodbye Billy! (A tragedy, we know) And so the originally planned team started life anew as the mighty women fighters' team.

Heidern: Heidern was devised as a cold-blooded killing machine when he first saw digital life, but as the KOF story unfolded, Heidern's designer identified with the character and provided him with a tragic past. When his super special moves were completed, the moves were so wild that game designers worried that he would have to be depicted as a sorcerer or an alien in order to explain his dazzling moves.

Ralf Jones: In the first stages of Ralf's development, he appeared shirtless to truly express the feeling of ikari or rage, but during the designing phase, someone felt his look was a bit dated and Ralf got the apparel he's now known and loved for. He originally had special moves that allowed him to use grenades, setting him apart from other team members, and a distinctive design, but his use of grenades in a fighting competition was deemed a bit unfair, so he lost that particular talent.

Clark Steel: At the beginning of development, the only differences in designs for Ralf and Clark was one had a hat and the other had a bandanna, but Clark later got a pair of sunglasses to become the character he is today. Clark basically looks a lot like Ralf, but since the designer in charge of adjusting this character worked on his hit accuracy, action speed and attack strength, their combat style is where the true differences between the two can be found.

Athena Asamiya: Given that Athena is always the most highly anticipated character of the series, the pressure to keep her on the roster at any cost is pretty overwhelming. And because SNK staff focuses so much on her, SNK have been accused of favoritism. Japanese fans asked SNK to dress her in a sailor blouse and skirt, but we scrubbed that idea because SNK felt it wouldn't translate overseas and be a bit too risque. But SNK made up for that omission with her wild entrance actions (Hubba! Hubba!).

Sie Kensou: Compared with Athena, Kensou's design has been a bit slapdash. In the previous title, Athena stole the show and since we felt Kensou was a bit too overshadowed by her, SNK gave him a radically new look to appeal to our female fans. We're often asked about Kensou's use of Japanese with an Osaka accent in the game, but he's always done that since his Psycho Soldier days. In other words, he's been doing it far longer than Robert has.

Chin Gentsai: When SNK first decided to try our hands at a fighting game, SNK felt we just had to have a geezer who used the Drunken Fist form of martial arts. Getting the OK, SNK introduced this character as Athena's teacher. As we aimed to create a genuine Drunken Fist master, SNK thought it would be hard to get the right touch, but since designer was good at drawing old guys, the finished product far exceeded original expectations. Unfortunately for the designer, he was unable to shake this habit and all of his subsequent characters tended to look like spry old men.

Mai Shiranui: Regarding Mai's familiar pause action... One day, the designer for Mai asked if it was all right to increase Mai's pause actions, and because the powers that be thought there was enough remaining memory for the game (actually there wasn't) they said, 'Go for it'. When the completed pose was presented, it knocked people flat. Due to this pose's potency, however, Mai's eye-popping motions were stilled in the KOF '94 international home version.

King: As far as King's super special moves go, there were various reasons why the 'Surprise Rose' was initially scheduled to be scrapped. Just when the development staff was worrying about coming up with a move that was something different, though, King's designer whipped this move up, it was well received, and it became her super special move, with no alterations needed.

Heavy D!: Since there has been a number of boxers in fighting games, Heavy D! was designed with the intent to create a different type of pugilist. When he first appeared on the drawing board, D! was not intended to be that big a character, but as he evolved and stood among the other characters it became apparent that he was one huge dude. ...Due to certain production circumstances, however, D! kept his imposing stature and came to be the character he is today.

Lucky Glauber: Known as the basketball fighter, Lucky's original image was based on the character appearing in the Bruce Lee movie, 'Game of Death'. Though originally created with that image in mind, his first design was deemed too plain and he then received his current look. His ability to use karate, though, is a remnant of his original conception.

Brian Battler: Brian came into being well before the KOF project came down the pike, and he's one of the oldest characters. He originally wore a helmet and chest pad, but he shed that equipment to arrive at his current design.

Kim Kaphwan: At first, the duo of Chang and Choi were set to team with another vicious criminal to form the Fugitive Team, but due to certain circumstances the third criminal was replaced with Kim and the familiar team came into being. The addition of Kim was considered somewhat forced, however, so Kim received the mission of rehabilitating the two.

Chang Koehan: Chang was originally far more violent than he is today, but once he teamed up with Kim, he became mellowed a bit. Chang's super special move, the Wild Ball, was originally designed as a test move, but it got such a good response that it was put into the game without alteration. This move is a pastiche of Kim's Phoenix Kick.

Choi Bounce: Choi is KOF's mighty novelty character. His original design looked way too much like a certain someone, so he was hastily given a new look a month before the final character designs had to be completed, giving Choi's designers one major headache. The first time Choi displayed his attacking and retreating moves and rolled around the screen, he revealed not only his fighting abilities but his talent for physical comedy.

An interesting thing about Chang and Choi: Chang was the tallest and heaviest KOF character, while Choi was the lightest and shortest. The duo is very popular in Japan, but hated by American fans. Because of their size differences, they have made a (quite) comedic couple, making the Korean team (or the Kim team) the comedy-relief team of KOF.

Rugal Bernstein: The concept for this character at the time was to make the mightiest (most violent) and most evil boss character ever. As everyone knows, Rugal is the King of Bosses who boasts the most appearances in the KOF series as a boss character, but even considering the whole genre known as 'competitive fighting games', his story and moves have changed ever so gradually while appearing in so many titles, he's one of the few bosses to have been loved (heh, heh) over such a long period.

Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

Brazil Stage's background music (Jungle Bouncer) samples "Surprise! You're Dead!", a song from Faith No More (1989).

The background music from USA Stage (Slum No. 5), Japan Stage (Esaka) and the 2nd Rugal Stage (Showdown R &amp; D) all contain voice samples from "Gutfest '89", a song from Digital Underground.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '94 - PCCB-00162) on 21/10/1994.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Select Victory Pose: Press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.

* Critical Hit Oddity: A critical hit is an attack done at the opponent while he/she is attacking. In this game there is a bug that enables either the CPU or the player to take out insane amounts of damage if this is done right. An easy-to-do example is to counter Kim's Hisho-Kyaku with Heidern's Moon Cutter (you must hit Kim's legs with Heidern's hand), if done right you'll take 80-90% off Kim's life-bar in one hit! Try it with other characters and be amazed (This does not work in any other game in the KOF series, though!).:)

* Beat the game without continuing to see all the characters grouped together on the The End screen.

- TRIVIA -

Released in July 1995.

The background for the Japan Team is, in fact, a real place.

Yuri's Chou Upper is very similar to Sakura's own Shou'ou Ken.

Iori Yagami: Since the KOF '95 project began with the concept of introducing Iori as Kyo's rival, he became known as a character who was a member of a rival school of martial arts that had a connection to the Ancient Arts of the Kusanagi. He was also given the ability to use a different color of flames other than Kyo's (red flames), along with various other characteristics. When you think of Iori Yagami, his intense personality most likely comes to mind. His moves are unique, and his singular choice of hairstyle, wardrobe, and manner of speaking was certainly a personality that broke the mold for characters in fighting games at that time. During the initial location tests to determine the popularity of the game, Iori was the character who stood out most. His hair and his lines to provoke his opponents ('You think I'm scary, do you?') excited his fans to no end. What set him apart are his memorable lines: 'You cry! You scream! Then you die!', 'Think of me when you gaze at the moon', and a whole catalog of others too numerous to list here.

Billy Kane: Along with Eiji, Billy appears as Iori's 'teammate' (ha, ha) in KOF'95. With the three rivals to the heroes coincidentally appearing on a single team, the name of the 'Rival Team' was decided upon as an afterthought. But since we couldn't wait for the rest of the world to get used to that concept and given the insanity of Iori, the team had to disband after their single appearance in KOF'95. As memory serves, the designers for this team were so motivated to create this team that their finished product was quite impressive. As a matter of fact, the voice actors worked like busy beavers to give the characters their lines. These characters were portrayed by Mr. Namase in '95, Mr. Yamanishi in '97, '98 and '02 and Seijiro in '03.

Omega Rugal: After apparently dying in KOF '94, Rugal's resurrection in KOF '95 turned him, convincingly enough, into a cyborg (prosthetic arms) armed (pardon the pun) with the power of the Orochi. In the subsequent titles of KOF '98 and KOF 2002, Rugal was brought back not once but twice to conclude story-lines. Why? "He's the only character who truly represents the ultimate KOF boss". Among these, Omega Rugal from KOF '98 was the most powerful and had the flashiest moves, so he's one of our personal favorite boss characters of the series.

Saisyu Kusanagi: His first appearance was, of course, in KOF '94, but his presence in KOF '95 was never planned (because he was supposed to have died in '94). During the final stages of KOF '95, he suddenly was inserted as a mid-level boss. That's who Saisyu Kusanagi is. Given that spur of the moment appearance, it's quite unexpected that he's still a very popular character? no offense to him, mind you. During location tests for the game, not one of his fans read the Chinese characters for his name as 'Saisyu', and he came to be known as 'Shibafune'.

Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '95 - PCCB-00187) on 19/08/1995.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Rugal and Saisyu Kusanagi: At the team edit screen, the 15 second counter, press and hold Start. While holding start, push Up+B, Right+C, Left+A and Down+D. The two bosses should then appear on either side of the counter and the counter should reset back to 15.

* Select Victory Pose: Press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.

* Beat the game on Hard or MVS mode without continuing to see a collage of all the teams after the credits.

The King of Fighters '96 (c) 1996 SNK.

The 3rd chapter in this groundbreaking series brings 27 classic SNK characters together against Goenitz, the final boss.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-214

[SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls]
2 players - 4 buttons per player.
=&gt; [Joystick] 8-way, [A] Weak Punch, [B] Weak Kick, [C] Strong Punch, [D] Strong Kick

- TRIVIA -

Released in July 1996.

This is the first game to include special phrases and poses when two characters in particular fight. In this game, it happens only with Kyo Vs. Iori, Terry Vs. Geese and Ralf Jones vs Clark Steel.

Ryo Sakazaki's fighting stance changed from the regular 'dukes up' to try and distance him from being thought of as a Ryu ripoff. His basic moves, however, remained unchanged.

Yuri's Yuri Chou Mawashi Geri is a knock-off of Ryu's Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku.

If you look at the game code for this game, you would have seen more moves that were originally planned for this game, but never made the cut (for some characters, these moves debuted in later games).
Among those moves that were cut were Kyo's Saishuu Kessen Ougi 'Mu Shiki', Daimon's Arashi no Yama, Robert's Muei Senpuu Juudan Kyaku, Ralf's Umanori Vulcan Punch, Clark's Running Three, Geese's Deadly Rave and Choi's Hou'ou Kyaku.

Geese's music (Geese ni Katakori) is a remixed version of his Fatal Fury 1 theme music (Geese ni Kiss).
A remixed version of Big Shot! (originally Terry's theme music in "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory") was used as the Fatal Fury Team's music.

About Leona: Along with the extensive overhaul to the team lineup of KOF '96, Leona entered the series as a replacement for Heidern, leader of the Ikari Team. Introducing the plot element of Heidern's adopted daughter had been dreamed up by the game designers before the production of KOF '96, and the details surrounding her origins gradually came to include a crucial role as a descendant of the Orochi tribe. Designed with the ardent love of her designers, Leona's special moves are markedly unique compared to the other characters, and reveal the particular tastes of her designers.

About Mature: She used to be Rugal's secretary. For the chief game planner at the time, it seems that both she and Vice were given the image of the 'ruthless woman' and the 'cruel woman' respectively, but when they became actual characters things got a little hectic, and someone came up with, 'Rugal had a secretary, didn't he. Make it two and run with that'. So these two characters came into being (Talk about slacking off). Consequently, they received additional characteristics: they were actually spies sent to observe Rugal and the descendants of the Orochi 8ketsu Clan.

About Vice: If Mature was the 'ruthless woman', Vice was to be the 'cruel woman'. The official illustrations for Vice and Mature remain extremely popular, and we're glad we could supply our fans with these images that cannot be reduced to pixels. The period of development for KOF '96 dragged on right up to the time of its scheduled release. At the location test for this title, Mature and Vice were still not included in the game. It's not that they were hidden, but there wasn't enough time to insert them into this initial version (we can talk about this calmly now, but at the time...forget about it!).

About Goenitz: In spite of the fact of Goenitz's sole official appearance in '96, he continues to have a considerable following of fans to this day, making him one of KOF's most popular characters. With strength that surpasses Rugal, the boss character of '94 and '95, the episode of the young Goenitz taking out the eye of Rugal was added to the game's story. Rugal, in turn, relieved Heidern of one of his eyes, which makes us think that SNK sure seems to have a lot of one-eyed characters, witness Gilbert, Jubei Yagyu, and Ramon. If you look carefully at the Goenitz the designer drew at the time (with a little help), you'll notice the shiver-inducing moment in which Goenitz appears to have six fingers.

About Geese Howard: The dream event for SNK's most recognizable characters! ...and what dream event would be complete without the appearance of Geese? Naturally, he's the character who people hope appears in the game each year, and there were plans to have him appear in KOF '95 long before. Various considerations at the time, however, led developers to abandon this plan. Then, with the time being ripe, Geese reappeared in KOF '96. Even throughout the game, this boss team received special treatment: things like leitmotif music were prepared for each member and at the time of this title's release, enthusiasm for this game reached a feverish pitch. Numerous special moves were prepared for Geese, but in view of the memory capacity and time required for adjustments, a good number of Super Special Moves had to be left out. A waste, really...

About Wolfgang Krauser: In KOF '96 the Boss Team was formed! And with that, Krauser entered the tournament, teaming up with his half brother Geese... but at the time, in terms of memory limitations and the KOF system of that time, it was a tough environment to faithfully depict the Krauser of Fatal Fury. Developers still cringe remembering the numerous criticisms, big and small, regarding the Fatal Fury Team's treatment. KOF '96 saw the debut of Krauser as a player character, but in the ending sequence he did make a cameo in KOF '94.

About Mr. BIG: For a variety of reasons, the Krauser of KOF got a bad rap, but BIG received favorable reviews from the fans. BIG is an austere villain brimming over with adult appeal-that's the character of Mr. BIG. The behavior of the women who hang with him also is based on a certain video the designers of the time often watched. The woman mutters, "He's bad", but just what does that actually mean? The truth remains a deep mystery. During the development stage, a positive slide for his Super Special Moves included one labeled "Spinning Stick Thrust, Kind of Like an Anti-Air Assault". We'd like to think that the move wasn't scrapped because of the vagueness of its name, but it's too bad the general public never got to see it. It rocks!

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '96 - PCCB-00223) on 21/08/1996.

- TRIVIA -

Released in July 1997.

Yuri has a long record of taking movements from other characters, especially Capcom (see previous KOF entries). In this new opus: Yuri's new special attack 'Hien Rekkou' is a knock off of Ken's Shoryuu Reppa.

Roddy and Cathy from "Top Hunter - Roddy &amp; Cathy" appear in the Kowloon background at the extreme left.
Other characters appearing in the Kowloon stage are: Roddy Birts and Lenny Creston from "Art of Fighting 3 - The Path of the Warrior".
The American Sports team from "The King of Fighters '94".
Lee Pai Long, Tung Fu Rue and Jubei Yamada from "Art of Fighting" and "Fatal Fury Special" and King's Waitresses with Rugal's panther.

The Terry's theme music was originally from "Real Bout Fatal Fury Special".
The Ryuji Yamazaki and Mary's Blues theme music was originally from "Real Bout Fatal Fury Special".
The Athena Asamiya thene music come from "Psycho Soldier".

The name of the 3 characters instrumental in the defeat of Orochi have some relation to the original legend:
1) Kyo Kusanagi: The Kusanagi is the name of the sword that was used to kill the Great Serpent.
2) Iori Yagami: One of his moves, the Ya Sakazuki, means '8 wine cups', which were needed to get the Great Serpent drunk.
3) Chizuru Kagura: She was the last surviving member of the Yata clan and the mirror used to seal Orochi away was a homage to the mirror in the legend (in the legend, it was a mirror created by the Great Serpent's tears).

In this iteration of KOF and the following games where he is a playable character, Choi Bounge gains a special throw (using the D button) where he pokes his claws up the opponents rear, this is actually supposed to be a Japanese prank, but the pranksters do not use claws.

About Ryuji Yamazaki: To bring the story that had grown too large and out of control back on track, the members of the Orochi 8ketsu Clan were teamed up in '97. By doing this, the dev. team thought, the story would reach its conclusion for the time being... but among the 3 new faces including Leona's father Gaidell, the dev. team lacked one more member for the 8ketsu. What should we do?... And along came Ryuji Yamazaki to bail us out of our predicament. A snake charmer that even looked like a snake, he became a popular villain. He once humbled himself, joined up with the Fatal Fury team, and blended into the world of KOF more than we had predicted. The game planner at that time really knocked himself out to provide new moves for Yamazaki. Idea after idea got a short trip to the circular file (Attract opponent after Snake Charmer move; Seven Serpent Dagger Throw, etc.), and those failures led to successful moves like the Sand Sweeper.

About Blue Mary: Receiving the strong support of fans in a magazine's popularity poll, Blue Mary made her name known to the public, appearing in KOF from '97. Losing to Blue Mary in the popularity contest, as a matter of fact, was Duck King. This popularity contest truly decided the fate of these 2. From '97 to '03, Mary became a regular to the series for the staff. Duck, on the other hand, hit the skids, and he was relegated to cameos at the side of screens, in backgrounds, or as a Striker character. Doesn't this fleeting episode make you think about the impermanence of everything? Since the designer in charge of Mary preferred her outfit in "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory", she's kept that look until now. It seems to have worked.

About Yashiro Nanakase: Yashiro's team was created to offset the remaining top 3 characters. With the combination of their use of 3 elements-Kyo and Chris representing fire, Benimaru and Shermie signifying lightning, and Daimon and Yashiro standing in for the earth-the concept for Yashiro and his cohorts as rivals to the series' heroes was further emphasized. It also explains the battle of hairstyles (and bands, too) between Yashiro and Iori. In consideration to events going on in the world today, designers have expiated some of Yashiro's more wicked ending lines-such as, 'Execution, accomplished.'-and tossed them into the dustbin of game history. Incidentally, some of the production codes for his Super Special Move commands consisted of moves like the '260 Million Slams'. Some of his dumped moves included 'Human Surfing'.

About Shermie: Shermie is a glamorous girl who works as a fashion designer and plays in a band as a hobby. But in fact she is one of the 4 Orochi leaders who's adept at body slams. Come to think of it, she's quite an enigmatic character. The material for Shermie the 'Raging Lightning Flash' comes from L the Third. And even more trivia: the character of Yashiro comes from Bl.. G... Xa..gle and the character of Chris is derived from A.T. V...ms. The design for Shermie was easily decided on. Given her long bangs that will absolutely never reveal her eyes, she was called Tesse from "Waku Waku 7" at one time. Her hidden eyes burn with a homicidal glare it is said, but there's no material that reveals what her face actually looks like.

About Chris: Chris can kill with an innocent smile on his face-kind of a creepy personality trait, come to think of it (but he looks so cute, doesn't he?). To pull things together and bring the story concerning the leaders of the Orochi and the 8-ketsu clan to its climax once and for all in '97, a lot of story elements were forced onto Chris who became the vessel fort the Orochi (this actually began from the early stages of production). And there's a story behind Chris's Super Special Move line, 'Ripping the chrysalis, the butterfly flutters'.

About Orochi: At first, designers planned a rather extreme setting in which a buck-naked Chris battled with a glowing energy ball, but for better or worse went with the current design (A survey of the designers garnered a mere 2 votes for the design for a buck-naked Chris). Incidentally, his design codename was 'Chief'. A lot of people were against the name 'Orochi', too, but these days it has become a firmly established proper noun in gaming lingo.

About Orochi Iori: The powers that be, who created the stories for the boss characters to heat things up for the series with KOF '97, first decided to make the final boss an Orochi to conclude the series' "Orochi Saga". The stage bosses were an easy choice: the 3 remaining characters of the Four Orochi Deities. This was followed with the suggestion to make the final boss Iori, 'berserk with the Orochi blood rage'. So the 'Minor', 'Middle', and 'Major' bosses were decided, with the 'Orochi Iori' we know and love rounding off the quartet as the final boss. Because this character was originally designed as a player character at the time, he's designed to mow down the other characters with relative ease.

About Orochi Leona: If Iori appeared berserk with the Orochi blood, the other successor in the bloodline of the 8-ketsu Clan, Leona, was also destined to go berserk someday. That's how this character came about. But inexplicably the design team wanted to heat up battles against the computer. So various sequences such as televised broadcasts were added, and provided a turn of nail-biting events that sent players to a 'fork in the game' that would pit them up against either Orochi Iori or Orochi Leona in the end. But savvy players who knew how to get a character to appear would be able to select their particular routes.

About Kyo Kusanagi Version '94: Along with KOF '96 game system changes, Kyo got a new arsenal of different Special Moves, and the wielder of the 'Dark Thrust' was as popular as ever. And designers also added the KOF '94 version of Kyo Kusanagi to satisfy all our fans. Designers were apprehensive about returning to the old character design, but this all disappeared with the warm acceptance of fans.

About Shingo Yabuki:: The code name for this character in the early stages was 'Shingo Suzuki'. The plainness of his name conversely suited Shingo quite well, we thought, but what do you think ? He was originally based on Kyo with the concept of becoming a comic, everyday guy foil, but in spite of our intention to promote him simply and plainly, he was splashed all over the place and his silhouette appeared in pre-promotion campaigns in magazines, becoming an extensively hyped character. And his voice was supplied by the famous Japanese voice actor Taketo Koyasu. And one more thing, Shingo is a character who can't shoot flames. And probably never will.

The dialogue heard during the Title Screen music (4th Fire) goes as follows:
"They're back to the heat... For the answer they've long been searching for.
Is it their fate, or just a bloody coincidence? It shall be clear, as three powers will be as one...
Now, the fourth phase is about to begin!
The King of Fighters '97.
The story moves towards its violent destiny."

A hack of this game is known as "The King of Fighters '97 Plus" and allows you to play evil versions of Leona, Iori and the Orochi team plus Orochi himself.
Another hack is known as "King of Gladiator".

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'. 

Pony Canyon released a 2 CD limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '97 - PCCB-00273) on 20/08/1997.

The King of Fighters '98 - The Slugfest (c) 1998 SNK.

The King of Fighters '98: The Slugfest is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players, featuring 38 selectable characters. As with previous games in the series, players can choose between two different playing styles: Advance and Extra. 

* Extra is similar to "King of Fighters '94" and is more suited to defensive play, as the fighters only have one power gauge and cannot run. They can instead sidestep to avoid incoming attacks and can also perform unlimited super moves when their energy is low. 

* Advanced mode gives the fighters the evasive roll introduced in "King of Fighters '96" and lets them store up to three full power gauges at once. This means they can choose to expend a gauge to get a damage boost, rather than letting it happen automatically. It also allows fighters to use more than one gauge to inflict more powerful versions of their super moves (instead of having to wait until their health is low). Fighters can also expend a gauge to quick roll out of an attack after successfully blocking it.

Both the 'Extra' and 'Advanced' modes have been tweaked since the previous game. Unlike KOF '97, fighters will return to normal if they perform a Super Special Move in MAX state. Also, when a fighter loses a round, they are given a handicap in their favour. In Extra mode, the time it takes to charge their power gauge to its maximum level is shortened. In Advance mode, the fighter's stock capacity of Power Gauges is increased by one.

- TRIVIA -

Released in July 1998.

This game is known in Japan as "The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends".

It is said that this game is a 'dream match' for more reasons than one - this KOF is said to exist only in Shingo's dream - each character in this dream match was Shingo's impression of these characters, based on either personal experience or his notes in his notebook.

Yuri has a long record of taking movements from other characters, especially Capcom (see previous KOF entries). In this new opus: Yuri's new special attack 'Shin! Chou Upper' is a knock off of Ryu's Shin Shoryuu Ken. She also has a movement similar to Terry's burn knuckle. Finally, her Forward+A is a parody of Sakura's Flower Kick.

KOF98 contains pieces of music from older KOFs.
For example, the character select music when a second player joins in is straight from KOF 96 (it's called Roulette).
Here's a complete list of themes, the teams (or individuals) they belong to and the games they were taken from:
Esaka? (Japan Team): KOF 96 (Japan Team's theme music).
Esaka (95-style Kyo Kusanagi): KOF 94 (Japan Team's theme music).
Kurikinton (Fatal Fury Team): Fatal Fury 2 (Terry Bogard's theme music).
Art of Fight (Art of Fighting Team): Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki's and Ryuhaku Todo's theme music).
Rumbling in the City (Ikari Team): KOF 96 (Ikari Team's theme music).
Shin! Senritsu no Dora (Psycho Soldier Team): KOF95 (Psycho Soldier Team's theme music).
Fairy (Gals Fighters Team): KOF 96 (Chizuru Kagura's theme music).
Seoul Town (Korea Team): Real Bout Fatal Fury (Kim Kaphwan's theme music).
Bloody (New Face Team): KOF 97 (New Face Team's theme music).
Rhythmic Hallucination (Orochi Yashiro): KOF 97 (Orochi New Face Team's theme music).
C62 (Ryuji Yamazaki): Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Ryuji Yamazaki's theme music).
Blue Mary's Blues (Blue Mary): Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Blue Mary's theme music).
London March (Billy Kane): Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Billy Kane's theme music).
Arashi no Saxophone (Iori Yagami): KOF 95 (Revenge Team's theme music).
Arashi no Saxophone 2 (Mature, Vice): KOF 96 (Iori Team's theme music).
Slum No. 5 (USA Sports Team): KOF 94 (USA Sports Team's theme music).
Still Green (Shingo Yabuki): KOF 97 (Shingo Yabuki's theme music).
Ketchaku R&amp;D (Omega Rugal): first half from KOF 94 (Rugal Bernstein's theme music), second half from KOF 95 (Omega Rugal's theme music).
Ne! ('94 Gals Fighters Team): KOF 94 (Gals Fighters Team's theme music).

Also to note that the music that is played prior to facing Rugal (Kettou R&amp;D) is also from KOF 94 (as the theme for Rugal's first form).

When Choi Bounge appears, a 7 seconds sample from a song is played. This song is 'Choi Bounge Ondo', which appeared in the KOF 97 Arrange SoundTracks. The song became quite popular in Japan.

Mr. Big from "Art of Fighting" makes a small cameo appearance in the USA Wharf background, during the first rounds.

About Kyo Version 95: Because the introduction of different versions for this character included as "hidden features" in KOF '97 was such a hit with fans, designers thought, another version of Kyo in KOF '98 would make the game more inviting. Designers also remember that both versions for Kyo Kusanagi for game tests were equally popular. This concept for different versions of this character subsequently became the basis for the 'Kyo clones'.

In the Japan Street stage, during the second round if you look in the middle of the background where some shops are, you can see tiny moving people who look like Iori, Mai and Terry Bogard. In the third and fifth round, you can see two people doing hand signals, they look similar to Kyo Kusanagi &amp; Shingo Yabuki. In the fourth round, you can see Mai and Terry.

A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neo+geo bios s1 tile-set rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the main-board z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after game over, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

- TRIVIA -

Released on July 22, 1999 in Japan.

The Fatal Fury Team music theme is a remixed version of Terry's theme in "Fatal Fury Wild Ambition".

About K' (K Dash): K' initially sported a slicked back hairstyle, but this was nixed by the powers that be and that's how the 'hairdo' for the hero of the NESTS Chronicles got changed. The reason for his hair being bushier than need be may be a reflection of the conditions around him. "Garou - Mark of the Wolves" was being developed concomitantly with KOF '99, so the staff learned that MOW's main character (Rock) looked like K' (causing the supervising designer to lose a few pounds from panic).

About Maxima: With the growing influence of teenagers, it seems the concept for Maxima evolved from a desire to introduce a sober and reliable middle-age character (sad state of affairs though when a twenty-something male is referred to as 'middle-aged'). The designers were initially supposed to design a character that used body slams, but the finished character became a fist-fighter. Strange how things happen, isn't it? Maxima was originally modified by the male scientist Dr. Makishima, but in a serialized KOF comic that came out in Hong Kong, he, for some reason, became a 'beautiful woman doctor'. This comic is hard to get your hands on in other parts of the world, but check it out if you have the opportunity.

About Whip: The plan was to introduce this character in KOF '96, but since Leona was already a part of the Ikari Team she began her series of appearances in KOF '99. Since Leona exposes comparatively more skin, Whip sports less revealing but body-hugging fashions that leave a little more to the imagination. The number of dots used on Whip's whip were reduced to express a feeling of speed and power - a daring method of expression. The supervising designer was sweating bullets over this when the design was checked (he feared he'd be accused of slacking off), but in the end the concept was approved without incident. The designers hoped that she would be accepted as an independent, whip-brandishing character rather than just another member of the Ikari Team.

About Pao: Due to circumstances regarding the game structure, a new character had to be added to the Psycho Soldier Team, and various ideas for this additional character were formulated. Some of these included: 'a younger idol from Athena's agency'; 'a love rival pitted against Kensou', 'a mighty male character with a scary appearance but a heart of gold and a love of nature', 'an old woman who looks after Chin Gentsai', and many others. With the appearance of Pao, the average age of the Psycho Soldier Team dropped dramatically...or was supposed to, but things didn't actually change that much (it dropped from 42 to 34 years old).

About Li Xiangfei: When development began for KOF '99, the designers grappled over which character from Real Bout 2 to choose, Rick Stroud or Li Xiang Fei. Giving the reasons that a cute female character and a Chinese boxer was desired, they unanimously selected Li Xiang Fei. Needless to say, the designers who came to this decision were all men. Typical! With the actual execution of this, however, the designers struggled to bring the character into the KOF world without ruining her image created in the Fatal Fury series. As you all know Li's move names in the Japanese version are all derived from place names in Osaka, so the designers enjoyed the work of coming up with names following this rule when new moves were added. Moves like Eiki Shuho (Vanguard Blast, in English) and Daikoku-cho (Big and Ugly Ultimatum) give her twice the appeal for local fans...

About Jhun Hoon: The savior of Chang Koehan and Choi Bounge, an evil fighter who's Kim's alter-ego, a fellow disciple who looks like Kim - these were some of the concepts for Jhun, but as you can gather from the current character he's way different from what was planned. And since he's not an evil character, this naturally meant Chang and Choi would not be saved from their predicament; so, sadly, they continue to walk the slow and steady path to redemption that they've been walking these long 10 years. Jhun is also the first character in KOF history to adopt the concept of the 'pose'. Coming up and creating this kind of move really put the designers to the test.

About Kyo Kusanagi-1: Actually Kyo Kusanagi-1 and Kyo Kusanagi-2 were not scheduled to appear in KOF '99 at the time. Nor were Kyo or Iori Yagami supposed to either. Designers initially decided to leave them out because of the new storyline and wanted to focus more attention on the new character of K'. But for various reasons, designers came to the conclusion that designer couldn't leave these popular characters in limbo, so they got a reprieve (and a new wardrobe, too). Designers also felt the old Kyo dressed in his school uniform was necessary and hurried to include him in the game (See Kyo Kusanagi-2 for more details).

About Kyo Kusanagi-2: Production was reaching its climax when the idea for including various Kyos was hit upon... While the staff kvetched - "Should the design for Kyo in a student's uniform come from KOF '94 or KOF '95?"; "We don't have time to think this over!" - the project head said: "Make two designs". The staff objected timidly: "Are you nuts? We don't have time for that!". So the project planner remarked, "OK, then. I'll design them". Having hung up his character-designing clothes years ago, the head planner whipped up designs Kyo Kusanagi-1 and Kyo Kusanagi-2 in no time. Naturally, designers were blown away by his mastery and speed rivaling that of a street-performing sketch artist.

Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.

1) Kyo Kusanagi with anyone except Iori Yagami.
2) Iori Yagami with anyone except Kyo Kusanagi.

There is a different ending for some predefined Teams if Krizalid will be defeated while using a specific fighter:

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Holding down the Attack button charges up your power and allows you to shoot an energy ball. 

- When you stand still for a period of time, an aura appears around your body, which increases your attack and defence power. Your aura has three phases and can be upgraded from red to yellow and then to blue:
-- Red Aura: Increases attack power by 25%. Disappears when hit. 
-- Yellow Aura: Increases attack power by 50%. Downgrades to red when hit. 
-- Blue Aura: Increases attack power by 75%. Downgrades to yellow when hit. 

- Pay close attention to your energy level as well as the energy level of attacking enemies. 

- The game ends when you run out of energy or the last boss is destroyed. 

- There are a total of five different levels and a powerful leader to eliminate at the end of each level. When you destroy a leader, you will be awarded bonus points and extra power, and you will advance to the next level.

The objective of this game is to shoot a certain colored block to other blocks of the same color to create a building. The larger the building the greater damage that is done to the player's opponent which in effect speeds up the moving counter which pushes the blocks ever closer to the edge after which the player or opponent will lose the battle.

- TRIVIA -

Bakumatsu Rouman - Gekka no Kenshi (translates from Japanese as 'Bakumatsu Romance - Swordsman In The Moonlight') was released on December 5th, 1997.

This game is known outside Japan as 'The Last Blade' and in Korea as 'The Last Soldier'.

Parts of Gekka no Kenshi was based off of the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin'.

The Bakumatsu period of Japan (1860-1899) represents the opening of Japanese ports to foreigners. The Last Blade is set during this time period and you can see Europeans in some backgrounds, as well as some European dress influences on some characters.

This game has a lot to do with Japanese religion. In what little understanding of Japanese culture, there are four gods in Japanese mythology: Seiryuu (blue dragon), Suzaku (red phoenix), Byakko (white tiger) and Genbu. Each god is associated with a direction: Byakko with west, Seiryuu with east, Genbu with north and Suzaku in the south. The four gods also seem to be portrayed in an identical manner: Suzaku is often seen as a renegade of sorts, Genbu is often wise, Byakko seems to be strong and Seiryuu seems to be the role of the protagonist. To this end, the four characters that are avatars to these gods in Gekka no Kenshi (Kaede, Okina, Shigen and Kagami) seem to fit the gods themselves to a tee (Kaede to Seiryuu, Okina to Genbu, Shigen to Byakko and Kagami to Suzaku). However, there may be one (unintentional) reference to the entire fighting game itself. These four characters may very well represent the four popular styles of characters found in nearly fighting game:
Kaede is a Shotokan-style character. This type of character, of course, is the earliest type of fighting game character (as early fighting games always had the protagonist be proficient in some form of karate). However, ever since the release of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", a Shoto-character refers to a character with similar moves to that of Ryu and Ken from that game, or more specifically, a character with a projectile and a built upper. Kaede fits this property well: his Ittou Hayate is a projectile (much like Ryu's Hadou Ken) and his Ittou Kuuga is a built upper (like Ken's Shoryuu Ken). Of course, Kaede may also be a nod to that of SNK's first fighting game protagonist (Terry Bogard) as well: his Kasshin Fukuryuu super is in the style of Terry's Power Geyser. To this day, many fighting game characters are known as Shoto characters - their simplicity can't be beat.
Shigen is a large character. Large characters come generally in two flavors: the power character and the grappler (Shigen himself is a mix of both). Power characters generally don't move much but deal lots of damage per hit. Grapplers are those whose special moves are mainly throws. These characters tend to last longer because of their size, but have a weakness that they have either short range or are slow (or, in the case of some characters, overly complicated moves).
Okina may be described as a turtler. This may seem like an inside joke (Okina, in his profile, refers to his family as a bunch of turtles), but it sometimes make sense. Jokes aside, turtlers are not exactly a type of character, but a type of player. That is, a turtler is a player who tend to block attacks a lot.
Charge characters (i.e. those whose repertoire of moves are mainly charge moves) generally fall into this category, as it is often that they need to remain in a blocking position in order to get their charges and counterattack.
Over the years, there have been many incentives to stray away from this style (as well as derivatives thereof, such as ticking), such as guard breaks, overheads, low attacks, shorter charges and unblockable moves.
Granted, the turtler is not as big as a factor as it used to be (the most popular character in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" was Guile because of his turtling and ticking abilities), but Okina's reference to turtles remains.
Kagami, of course, continues SNK's tradition of making cheap-ass characters for final bosses.

Akari and Juzoh are the comedic relief characters in the Gekka series: Juzoh is seen in Akari's stage if Akari is fighting (and obviously, if Akari is not fighting Juzoh). Likewise, Akari can be seen in Juzoh's stage if Juzoh is fighting (and if Juzoh isn't fighting against Akari).

The title translates from Japanese as 'Bakumatsu Romance Episode II - Swordsman of the Moonlight: On the Moon a Flower Blooming, a Petal Falling'.

This game is known outside Japan as The Last Blade 2. 

Kojiroh Sanada is a homage to an ancient Chinese legend about a girl disguising herself as her father (the same story was also used in the Disney movie Mulan).

Lee Rekka is a homage to the Cantonese hero, Wong Fei Hung.

Akari and Juzoh are the comedic relief characters in the Gekka series: If Akari is fighting someone other than Juzoh, Juzoh can be seen next to the elephant. If Akari is fighting Juzoh, Akari's three friends (Hijiri Nanase, Aoi Yahata and Shizuka Kujou) can be seen next to the elephant. If Juzoh is fighting someone other than Akari, Akari can be seen with her friends.

- UPDATES -

In the original (Japanese) version of Last Blade 2, each of the 3 modes is described by one kanji: Chikara (red), Waza (blue) and Kiwame (green). Chikara means 'strength', Waza 'skill' and Kiwame 'extreme'.
These 3 modes were made into 'Power', 'Speed' and 'EX', respectively, for their English release.
However, one case where the modes were literally translated remain.
If you look at the English 'How To Play' intro in Last Blade 2, you will see 'Strength and Skill' where they should have said 'Power and Speed'.
A slight mistake in the English renaming, or a tribute to the Japanese and therefore correct, names.

Last Hope - Pink Bullets (c) 2009 NG:Dev.Team.

The evil empire is rushing at light-speed across the galaxies, heading towards Mother Earth. Barely 24 hours ago, they penetrated the last defense line of our galaxy, the Arsion Laser Belt. Millions of innocent people perished in outer space colonies. 70% of our fleet was destroyed during first contact. Our intelligence has now extrapolated their arrival within six days. Conventional weapons cannot stop them. Our last hope is in your hands: The Z-42 Warpstar. Warp into their territories and destroy their leader before they reach Earth.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Multiplier: you can raise up your score by making use of two multipliers. The first is the Bullet Absorb Multiplier and the second is the Beam Chain Multiplier. The individual score value of each enemy you destroy does multiply by both multipliers. By absorbing enemy bullets you can increase your Bullet Absorb Multiplier. Additionally you can increase this multiplier by absorbing bonus containers and hidden special bonus items. By chaining enemies, with your full charge beam, you can increase your Beam Chain Multiplier. This Beam Chain Multiplier is decreasing by one point per second while you don't beam chain enemies, so be quick.

League Bowling (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods: 'Regulation', 'Flash' and 'Strike 90'.

The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.

The 'Strike 90' mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the 'Flash' game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players' scores.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use the joystick to move, jump and duck. 
- Use the buttons to attack with your sword and to throw shuriken. 
- Kage must fight through five stages in order to rescue the princess: 
(1) Forest: Kage must avoid the attacks of the shinobi (enemy ninja) and Yobo monks. Defeat the red Yobo that appears after defeating three normal Yobos to complete the stage. 
(2) Cave: Kage must kill a certain number of shinobi. 
(3) Castle Wall: Move Kage in the direction of the arrows to climb the castle wall while dodging the attacks of shinobi. 
(4) Mansion: Rescue the princess on the top floor by cutting the rope. 
(5) Forest Stage 2: Defeat Yuikasa Yoshiro (the evil warlord) and his right-hand man, Yukinosuke, who chase Kage and the princess. 

- Kage is constantly under attack by enemies, so you must be alert at all times. Avoid the enemy swords and spikes by jumping up, ducking down or blocking them with your sword. 

- Yobo attacks Kage with his iron club and flames. When being attacked with the flame, it is better to stay low and approach Yobo from underneath.

Originally released as "Lock'n'Chase [Model DT-111]".

The game is a maze game. Like "Pac-Man", you're trying to eat up dots while four cops (with the names Spiffy, Smarty, Scaredy and Silly) try to stop you. While you don't have energizers to eat the cops with, you CAN block them off with walls (or better yet, try to trap them in the corners). When you're finished eating dots, there are two exits for you to escape from the cops.

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 25 years ago:

Magical Drop III (c) 1997 Data East.

More characters, more gameplay modes, more frantic gameplay, more fun! This is what every videogame sequel should be, and the sequel to one of the best puzzle games for the Neo-Geo MVS is indeed a game not to be missed! Lots of fun for one or two players!

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-233

Players: 2
Control: 8-Way Joystick
Buttons: 3

- TRIVIA -

Magical Drop III was released on February 25, 1997. This is Data East's final arcade video game. 

The game now features parodies of all the characters featured in the 22 cards of the major Arcana in a Tarot card deck. These are numbered from 0 to 21 as follows: 
00. Fool 
01. Magician 
02. High Priestess 
03. Emperor 
04. Empress 
05. Hierophant 
06. Lovers 
07. Chariot 
08. Strength 
09. Hermit 
10. (Wheel of) Fortune 
11. Justice 
12. Hanged Man 
13. Death 
14. Temperance 
15. Devil 
16. Tower 
17. Star 
18. Moon 
19. Sun 
20. Judgement 
21. World 

Note that the only exception to this statement would be Black Pierrot since he does not appear in a Tarot card deck. Black Pierrot is an added bonus character to challenge really good Magical Drop 3 pros! 

Note: In puzzle and adventure modes, only 8 characters are available: Fool, High Priestess, Emperor, Lovers, Chariot, Strength, Justice and Star.

- UPDATES -

The Japanese version of this game features LOTS of stuff unavailable in any other version:

* In Challenge Mode there is a story intro at the beginning explaining the reason behind the Magical Drop competition, an extra animation showing a close-up of the Magical Drop book as it opens,  an ending for each character available in the game, a "Hard" difficulty setting, as well as a bonus fortune reading when you beat the Challenge Mode or you lose against the CPU and  refuse to continue. All of this is absent in the USA &amp; Europe versions.

* In Challenge Mode, each character has a unique set of quotes before a battle begins, this even applies in the battles against the end bosses Tower &amp; Fortune. In the USA &amp; Europe versions there are only two possible quotes before a fight for all characters:

Quote #1
CPU: Get out of my way!
Player: I'll never lose to you! 

Quote #2
CPU: You want to fight?
Player: Now let's see who is better!

* In Adventure mode, each character has its very own story intro as well as its very own ending which is different from the one seen in Challenge mode. Additionally this mode plays like a board game in which you compete against three other characters on the board, and if any of the others get to Empress' castle before your character, you will get a generic bad ending. If you arrive on a tile already occupied by a CPU-controlled character, you will have 2 options:
1) The option on the right: you don't want to trouble and ignore the opponent (sometimes you will have to back off 1 tile)
2) The option on the left: you fight the opponent. If you win, he or she will be eliminated but it would be the same for you if you fail, so be careful!
In the USA and European versions, there is no storyline and the only character on the board is controlled by the player. 

* Like in the previous game, each character has his/her own unique voice. The European version features less voice tracks and the USA version features a single voice track for all characters.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Father Strength: At the character select screen, highlight Strength, hold C and press A or B. This trick does not work nor in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode. 

* Play with bonus characters: At the character select screen, highlight any character (Except World, World's number is 21 so she can't be used for this trick) and wait until the timer counts down to the number assigned to that character: 
00 - Fool 
01 - Magician 
02 - High Priestess 
03 - Empress 
04 - Emperor 
05 - Hierophant 
06 - Lovers 
07 - Chariot 
08 - Strength 
11 - Justice 
13 - Death 
15 - Devil 
17 - Star 
19 - Sun 
20 - Judgment 
Then push C only three times. Moon, Hanged Man, Hermit, Temperance, Tower and Fortune will appear and will now be selectable. This trick does neither work in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode. 

* Secret Stages: 
1) Moon (after Level 6): Finish the sixth stage without exceeding 90 seconds since the beginning. 
2) Hanged Man (after Level 6): Finish the sixth stage exceeding 300 seconds since the beginning. 
3) Black Pierrot (after Level 10): Finish the tenth stage with at least 150000 points.

		<name>Magician Lord</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 32 years ago:

Magician Lord (c) 1990 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.

Magician Lord is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which players take on the roll of a wizard called Elta - the last Magician Lord - on his quest to save his homeland from the evil Gul-Agieze, who plans to resurrect the God of Destruction using 8 tomes of mystical power.

Elta has to jump, shoot and climb his way to the end of each of the game's 8 levels where he must beat a servant of Gal, along with one of Gal's sinister boss creations. To complete the game Elta must reach the final stage and defeat Az Atorse himself. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, Elta will be harassed by an invincible monster.

Elta's primary form of attack is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that can fired in one of four directions, but by collecting the special colored orbs that occasionally appear, he can transform into a different form, making him more powerful and giving him new attacks.

These are the six different forms that Elta can assume by picking up the colored orbs:

* Dragon Warrior: In this form Elta attacks by breathing fire; a continuous short-range attack that, unlike the standard attack, can also be aimed diagonally.

* Waterman: The Waterman-form attacks with water grenades – blue bubbles of water that burst upon touching the ground and form into water pillars. The attack can hit several times for additional damage but only covers a small area.

* Poseidon: A more powerful version of the Waterman, Poseidon shoots wide waves of water that travel along the ground for several hits. It does severe damage and causes enemies to freeze and shatter on impact. While very powerful, this form moves very slowly.

* Shinobi: The Shinobi-form gains increased agility and attacks with powerful magical arcs of fire which are wide but slow-moving.

* Samurai: While limited in range, the Samurai-form is the only form that can attack through walls, shields or even multiple enemies, using a boomerang-like energy attack that does heavy damage.

* Raijin: The Raijin-form gives Elta's jumping ability a big boost as well as a unique attack that creates a continuous electrical field around his body.

- TRIVIA -

The project design (kukakusho) debuted in 1989 and the development started first semester of 1989. A beta version was location tested in January 1990 in Japan, this version had longer stages and this was not adapted for an arcade play (a game was too long). So, developers taked the decision to smaller all stages but cutting them off for the final version.

This is the first Alpha Denshi game for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware and it was the first game which used the capabilities of the hardware (dezooming, rotate).

27 player's transforms were planned but only six were finalized due to gameplay changes.

Magician Lord MVS was released in June 1990 in Japan. At this time, this game was the Killer application for Neo-Geo, all reviews from magazines were very positive, many people wanted it and bought it.

After entering 99 credits, the box should disappear and Saojin's portrait should be there. She is now selectable. 
NOTE: If this code doesn't work for you at first, clear the old MM data then follow the above steps.

		<name>Matrimelee / Shin Gouketsuji Ichizoku Toukon</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 20 years ago:

Shin Gouketsuji Ichizoku Toukon - Matrimelee (c) 2002 Playmore.

Revived from the New Power Instinct series, the Goketsuji clan has appeared newly on the MVS Neo-Geo! In addition to the familiar 11 characters, individual fresh 4 join in the heated Head Decision Match. You will be overwhelmed by the spectacular graphics and the BGM. Attention to the memorial Marriage Battle over the right to the throne and get ready!

- TECHNICAL -

SNK Neo-Geo MVS harware
Game ID: NGM-266

Players: 2
Control: 8-way Joystick
Buttons: 4
=&gt; [A] Weak Punch, [B] Weak Kick, [C] Strong Punch, [D] Strong Kick

- TRIVIA -

Developed by Noise Factory &amp; Atlus. Also licensed to SNK Playmore for manufacture and distribution.

Even if the copyright year shows 2002, this game was officialy released in public March 2003.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'True Gouketsuji Family Fighting Spirit - Matrimelee' ('Gouketsuji' is literally means 'Overpowering Blood Temple Family').

Known outside Japan as 'Matrimelee'

Some characters from the Power Instinct series received some minor name changes in this game:
Thin Nen =&gt; Chinen
Otane =&gt; Tane
Oume =&gt; Ume
Kurara =&gt; Clara
Annie =&gt; Anny
Pochi =&gt; Poochy

Also the transformation sequences from previous games has been almost completely ditched in this game (with the only exceptions of  super moves from Kanji, Clara &amp; Princess Sissy; as well as one of Tane's win poses).

While there have been a few fighting games that feature a vocal track as BGM (Roll's BGM in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes", Arina's BGM in "Waku Waku 7" &amp; Roomy's BGM in "Galaxy Fight - Universal Warriors" are but a few examples of this), the Japanese version of this game's BGM features an unprecedented number of excellent &amp; quite hilarious vocal tracks for many stages. Chinen BGM is nothing short of awesome!

Jones is the only selectable character from "Rage of the Dragons" that won't challenge you on the 3rd &amp; 5th battle. This is odd...

Abubo ("Rage of the Dragons"' sub-boss character) makes an unlikely cameo as one of Princess Sissy box surprises!

Kang Jae-Mo ("Rage of the Dragons" wrestler) makes a hilarious cameo in one of Jones' super moves.

Default highscore table (Ranking):
RANK SCORE NAME
1ST 0500000 PLM
2ND 0450000 ATL
3RD 0400000 MTM
4TH 0350000 NEO
5TH 0300000 GEO

Noise Factory released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Shin Gouketsuji Ichizoku Toukon - Matrimelee / Original Soundtrack) on May 01, 2003.

- UPDATES -

The US version of this game completely removed all the vocal tracks from the Japanese version and are replaced with the BGM of the "Rage of the Dragons" guest characters, causing those tracks to be recycled quite a few times. Such strange issue had already been seen in a few previous Neo-Geo games such as the Magical Drop games.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Enable "Rage of the Dragons" Characters: At the character selection screen, press Up(x4), Down(x3), Left(x2) and Right. The screen will go black and reappear with Lynn, Mr. Jones, Jimmy and Elias in the center of the character select screen.

* Play As Princess Sissy: After you choose your character, press and hold A+B+C+D until the match begins and you'll play as Princess Sissy.

Megablast (c) 1989 Taito Corp.

At the end of the 21st century, war and hunger disappear on the earth, and humankind go on very well. On such occasion, it occurred to humankind that mysterious disappearances of women rise in waves in many places in the world. The cause is found by the investigation of a secretly organized 'Defending-the-earth-from-the-outside-organization'. That is, a strange contagious disease prevails throughout a planet 'Zancs' in a dark nebula, and women's generative power is lost, then, women on the earth were abducted as substitutes for having their descendants. Downson and Bogey, the choice out of the 'Defending-the-earth-from-the-outside-organization'. start on a journey to the space by using 'Megablast' which is a space fighter equipped with all available products of the earth's scientific power in order to rescue the earth women as well as lovable 'Sindy' who is also abducted together with the other earth women.

- TRIVIA -

Megablast was released in November 1989.

As "Master of Weapon", Megablast was very unpopular. The main reason is the game was worse than other shoot'em ups of this period. So, most boards were withdraw.

According to a former taito developer, this game was supposed to be a four-way button game. Prototypes versions exist. Also, the ending would originally be a battle between players, but they were not able to completed this function. 

Only one soundtrack include the game's sounds (composed by Zuntata):  "Taito Retro collection 5" (KDSD-00553,00554) on May 30, 2012.

		<name>Major Havoc</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 39 years ago:

Major Havoc (c) 1983 Atari.

Major Havoc is a vector-based shoot-em-up and platform game in which the evil Vaxxian Empire overran the galaxy many years ago. Most of humanity was enslaved and abducted to the Vaxxian home world, although a few human scientists managed to escape. The Vaxxian Empire has long since collapsed but numerous Vaxxian space stations, all blindly controlled and defended by robots, still remain in the galaxy, mindlessly following their original, pre-programmed orders.

The small band of scientists who initially escaped have cloned the great human hero, 'Major Havoc' and tasked him with flying his 'Catastrofighter' through a wormhole in space so that he may lead a clone army against the dreaded Vaxxian robots and to liberate the remnants of humanity by destroying the enemy reactors. The player controls Major Rex Havoc, the leader of this band of clones.

The game is broken down into two distinct gameplay genres. The first is a shoot-'em-up in which the player controls Major Havoc's spaceship against the numerous robot ships that defend the enemy reactors. The ships are encased in a force-field shield which must first be shot and depleted before the ship itself can be destroyed. 

The second section is a platform/maze game in which the player - after first landing on the space-station by centering their ship between a moving white line - enters the station. The object here is to reach the core of the station and sabotage its reactor by setting an explosive charge. Once the charge has been set, the player must quickly escape back to their ship and and reach a minimum safe distance before the space-station explodes. 

The Space-station has reduced gravity, making Major Havoc react slowly to players' input. Each station has a maze-like layout and red arrows guide the player towards the station's core. Once the charge has been placed, more arrows guide the player to the station's exit. The mazes of successive space-stations become more complex and harder to navigate as the player progresses. Players also have a limited amount of oxygen in a station but more can be collected by running over the 'O2' symbols scattered throughout the maze.

Major Havoc features a warp system that allows players to skip levels and gain bonus points or extra lives. The warps are activated by a utilizing a Breakout-style mini-game at the bottom-right corner of the screen. 

The mini-game is available at the start of each wave and the way it works is this: a two or three-digit number is displayed and players must move the controller until the number matches the one required to warp. For example, the RED WARP requires the number '23', so the player must move the controller left or right until the first digit matches '2', then must press the fire button. The Breakout game begins and must be played while moving the joystick to the '3'. Once players have successfully entered the warp code, they are transported to a higher level.

- TRIVIA -

Major Havoc was released in November 1983.

New Features: 
* High-Tech Game Cabinet: A new video arcade game cabinet design delivers high visibility and increased player attraction.
* Roller Control: The backlit roller control provides left-to-right and right-to-left directional movement.
* Multi-Layer Printed-Circuit Board: This state-of-the art design printed-circuit board (PCB) provides low system noise with high system reliability.
* Game Within a Game: Action occurs in the lower right corner of the TACTICAL SCAN. Breakout can be played for a few seconds before the actual Major Havoc game play starts. Earn a bonus life here!
* Dual FIRE/JUMP Button: This dual-action button allows Major Havoc to jump in the maze sequence and to fire at enemy robots in the space wave.
* Add-A-Coin: This feature permits you to start a new Major Havoc game at the level where you last saw the TACTICAL SCAN in your previous game play.
* Secret Warp Code: The code feature rewards you for short game times as it advances to deep levels in game play. Use the roller control to dial in secret code numbers during the TACTICAL-SCAN wave.

Gameplay innovation at its finest. A game that would have done greater numbers had anyone cared in 1984. Only 300 dedicated machines were manufactured. Original price was $2,095. If Owen had done Major Havoc in a raster version, which was suggested, it would have sold 10 times as many. But unfortunately... the operators were getting very angry at vector games for failing all the time.

Mark Cerny came in the middle of the design, adding one of the space waves (the flying fish) and the last four base ship mazes. He also added some objects to the mazes (such as the gun and floating boots) and helped clean up old items that never got shipped.

The original name for the game was "Tollian Web", from the Star Trek episode The Tholian Web - an episode that also provided the inspiration for the unreleased "Ms. Gorf". Later titles included "Alpha One" and "Major Rex Havoc" (which was dropped when Atari discovered an underground comic with a similar name).

Ettore Ciaffi holds the official record for this game with 1,940,078 points.

A hack of this game is called "Major Havoc Return to Vax".

A Major Havoc unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Warp Codes: It's possible to warp to higher levels in Major Havoc from the start of the game by using certain codes. This is useful to not only be able to get through the game more quickly, but each warp also gives a fairly hefty bonus for carrying it out. This is done by playing the mini-Breakout game at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen when the game starts. The game will have a phrase such as, 'Enter Red Warp 00' at the bottom of the screen. What you do is use the controls to 'dial in' the first digit of the appropriate code given below, then press the Fire button to serve the ball and repeat as necessary. The codes are:
Red code - 23, 250,000 points, Level 4.
Yellow code - 46, 600,000 points, Level 9.
Green code - 824, 700,000 points, Level 10.
Aqua code - 315, 950,000 points, Level 13.

Note that you can only enter the codes in the order they're given - it's not possible to enter, say, the red warp code followed directly by the aqua warp code.

		<name>Millipede</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Millipede (c) 1982 Atari.

Millipede is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The game action takes place on a playfield filled with mushrooms, flowers, and deadly DDT bombs. The player tries to destroy a variety of insects that drop from the top of the screen or enter from the sides of the screen, most of them to attack the player. The player controls a bow-shaped vehicle called the Archer. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy as many objects as possible for a high point score, before the player's lives are all used up.

Player control consists of a Midi Trak-Ball control and a FIRE button. The Archer is moved by rotating the Midi Trak-Ball control. The Archer can be moved in all directions, but only within the bottom fifth of the screen. However, the Archer must move around mushrooms, flowers, and DDT bombs, since these are fixed and not 'transparent' objects. Pressing the FIRE button causes the Archer to emit an arrow that travels upward. The Archer may fire one or many arrows (by holding down the FIRE button constantly). But only one arrow will appear on the screen at a time.

A player may start a game at an advanced level of play and receive bonus points for starting play at that level.

Gameplay begins with a playfield of randomly placed mushrooms and DDT bombs. A Millipede enters at the top center of the screen and starts snaking its way across the screen. The Millipede changes direction when it runs into a fixed object in the playfield (mushroom, DDT bomb, or flower), or when it reaches the side boundaries of the playfield.

When a segment of the Millipede is shot, it is destroyed and a mushroom appears where that segment was shot. When shot, the Millipede breaks into two smaller Millipedes, each with its own head. When a Millipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts back up, but remains within the area of the Archer (the bottom 5th of the screen).

If a Millipede reaches the bottom of the screen without being shot, it releases its tail. This tail changes into a new head. Also to provide the player a challenge, if a Millipede is still alive when it reaches the bottom, new heads will enter the screen almost at the bottom of the sides. More of these heads will appear as time progresses.

An attack wave is complete when all Millipede segments are destroyed. The screen then scrolls down one line. At the 9th attack wave, when the Millipede with only four segments enters from the top of the screen, the screen will scroll down every two seconds. The only way a player can stop the scrolling screen is to shoot a DDT bomb or destroy the entire Millipede. 

It takes four shots to destroy a mushroom. After the fourth attack wave of each wave cycle, the entire playfield of mushrooms changes. Some mushrooms die and new mushrooms grow where there were none before. A mushroom next to a DDT bomb becomes poisoned (See Tips and Tricks below for complete details).

When a Millipede runs into a poisoned mushroom, two things happen: its head changes color, and it changes direction and falls vertically to the bottom of the screen.

DDT bombs explode when hit by an arrow. Any object near the bomb is engulfed by the explosion. Insects are worth three times their normal point value if they are destroyed by the explosion.

Spiders appear in any round. They move in a random pattern on the bottom third of the screen. As the player's score increases, the range of the Spider decreases, until it is confined to the bottom fifth of the screen. Also, more Spiders enter as the game progresses. A Spider destroys any mushroom or flower it moves over. Depending on a special option switch setting, the Spider moves slowly until a player reaches a specific score, and then it speeds up. If the Archer and a Spider collide, both are destroyed.

When a Millipede with fewer than eleven segments appears, an Earwig enters the screen from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Earwig's speed increases. If an Earwig passes over a mushroom, it poisons the mushroom.

When a Millipede with fewer than ten segments appears, a Dragonfly enters at the top of the screen. The Dragonfly moves in a zig-zag pattern and its speed increases as the player's score increases. As the Dragonfly moves, it leaves a trail of mushrooms behind.

When a Millipede with fewer than nine segments appears, a Mosquito enters at the top of the screen and flies in a diagonal pattern. The Mosquito's speed increases as the player's score increases. When a Mosquito is destroyed, the screen scrolls up one row.

Beetles appear randomly after the first wave. They enter from the sides of the screen near the bottom, travel down to the bottom of the screen, and walk at least half way across the bottom. Then the Beetle travels up and exits at the side of the screen. If a Beetle passes over a mushroom, the mushroom changes into a flower. Flowers cannot be destroyed by the Archer's arrows. Depending on a dip switch setting, the number of Beetles appearing on the screen and the speed of the beetles increase as the player's score increases. When a Beetle is destroyed, the screen scrolls down one row.

Bees may fall from the top of the screen during any round. As the Bee falls, it leaves a trail of mushrooms behind. The Archer must hit a Bee twice to destroy it; the first shot just speeds it up.

An Inchworm may appear when a Millipede with fewer that eleven segments appears. The Inchworm travels from one side of the screen to the other side. It moves slowly until the player's score reaches 80,000 points. Then it speeds up. If the Archer destroys the Inchworm, all insects will slow down for about three and one-half seconds.

After a Millipede of one, three, five, seven, or eleven segments has been destroyed, an insect bombing raid occurs. A raid may have only Bees, Dragonflies, Mosquitoes, or a mixture of all three.

- TECHNICAL -

Millipede came in two different form factors - an upright and a cocktail table - and it was also available as a conversion kit for "Kangaroo", "Dig Dug", and "Arabian". 

* The control panel features a trackball to move the Archer around the player area and a FIRE button for firing the arrows. 

* Millipede's trackball is larger in diameter than that of "Centipede", but smaller than that of the upright and cockpit versions of "Missile Command". All of the trackballs are prone to wear and tear, but replacement parts are readily available. 

* The upright version, by far the most common, is in a white cabinet that is rather strangely shaped. It really accents the speaker area in a way that no other games did. The game features ornate painted sideart of a huge orange millipede along with a hunter inside a forest scene. That graphic isn't just on the sides either, it continues all the way around the front of the machine as well. The control panel is dark and rather plain. It has the trackball, the FIRE button, some game instructions, and a few graphics of leaves. The marquee for this title shows a hunter clad in red, firing a long bow at an orange millipede. 

* The cocktail version is black and woodgrained, and mildly decorated with light blue graphics under the glass and on the control panels. This version has two control panels, on opposite sides of the cabinet; in a 2-player game, the players sit across from each other, and the screen's image flips over to face whichever player is currently controlling the Archer.

- TRIVIA -

Millipede was released in November 1982 in the USA. 8,690 upright units were produced. Also, 1,300 cocktails models were build.

Sequels to arcade games can be a 'hit and miss' thing. Taito was able to make a successful sequel to its "Space Invaders" game by releasing "Space Invaders Part II". Atari also attempted to make a sequel to its hit "Asteroids" called "Asteroids Deluxe". Unfortunately, the sequel was not received well and Atari took a loss with it. Atari had another runaway hit in 1980 called "Centipede". The game basically involved having the player take out insects and mushrooms that dotted the playing screen. Taking another chance, Atari released a sequel in 1982 called Millipede. Fortunately, Millipede received a better reception then "Asteroids Deluxe" did as a sequel and it did fairly well at the arcades. Other games that Atari released such as "Dig Dug", "Gravitar", and "Pole Position" may have also helped the sequel along. The game play was essentially the same as the original.

If you go into test mode, you will see a hidden 'Logg' sprite which refers to the game's programmer, Ed Logg.

Originally called 'Centipede Deluxe'. Here are the main differences between Millipede and "Centipede": 

* Instead of the Centipede and three enemies, you now have to deal with the Millipede and seven enemies. 

* In addition to the Bee dropping mushrooms, the Dragonfly also drops them. The difference between the two enemies is that the Bee goes in a straight line from top to bottom while the Dragonfly zig-zags across the screen from top to bottom. 

* Beetles turn mushrooms into flowers which can only be destroyed with DDT bombs or by Spiders. 

* On some screens, some of the mushrooms will disappear while others grow in other random places. 

* The player character is now an Archer, as it now shoots arrows instead of laser-type shots. 

* The screen advances down one level after each round is completed or for each Beetle that is hit. This will reveal other things when a new top level is revealed. Hitting a Mosquito causes the screen to advance up by one level. 

* Different events are based on how many segments the Millipede starts with. A segment is defined as not being a separate head. 

* DDT bombs have been added to help you take out areas of bugs, flowers, and mushrooms. DDT was a chemical that was banned in the 60's for pest control. 

* A new bonus setting has been implemented. It works depending on what the machine is set at for gaining bonus Archers. Once you cross that threshold multiple, you can start a new game from that score minus the original bonus score. The score tops out at 300,000 points. You have 30 seconds after your game ends to choose to do this. It works like this: 

1) The maximum level a player can start at is one level lower then the last free Archer they received.  For example, you receive a free Archer every 20,000 points. If you achieved a score of 50,000 points, then the last free Archer you received was at 40,000 points. Going one level lower, you can either start with a bonus of 0 or 20,000 points. It works the same for free Archers awarded at 12,000 or 15,000 points. 

2) The player will also be allowed to start a new game at a bonus level. Again, depending on what the machine settings are for free Archers will determine this bonus. The bonus will be 0, 1, 2, or 3 times whatever the score required is for a free Archer (i.e. 0, 12,000, 24,000, or 36,000 points to name one). You will have 10 seconds to make a decision.

* There are more score-dependent settings for the game. This means more enemies will do different things depending on the player's score.

* Millipede cycles back and forth with head to body ratio instead of just having heads like Centipede does.

James Schneider holds the official record for this game with 6,995,962 points.

A Millipede unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1988 movie 'Arthur 2 - On the Rocks'.

In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including: "Missile Command", "Battlezone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

Bee: 200 points (Takes 2 hits. First hit speeds it up, second hit destroys it)
Inchworm: 100 points
Mushrooms &amp; Poisoned Mushrooms: 1 point (Takes 4 hits to destroy).

When the mushroom patch is reset after the Archer is destroyed, each partially destroyed mushroom, poisoned mushroom or flower that is restored awards the player 5 bonus points. 

Enemies killed inside DDT blasts are worth three times their normal score. The exception to this are Spiders which are worth 1,800 points when killed by DDT and enemies on the raids which are worth their normal (progressive) point values.

Raids: Normal points for the first raiding insect killed. Additional kills on raiding insects are worth 100 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 1,000 points each.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Hints:

1) Destroy mushrooms near the bottom of the screen.

2) Destroy the DDT bomb when the Millipede is beside it.

3) When a Millipede hits a poisoned mushroom, it changes direction and falls vertically. Anticipate the place the Millipede will fall, because shooting it as it falls destroys all its segments.

* Know Your Enemies: This is the single most important aspect of this game. If you don't know how each of the enemies behave, you won't last long. The enemies are:

1) Millipede (Body and Head) - The main target of the game. Its role is basically identical to that of the Centipede in "Centipede". It goes back and forth across the screen and will drop to the next level when it encounters a mushroom, flower, DDT bomb, or the side of the game screen. It will go all the way to the bottom when its head hits a poisoned mushroom. 

2) Spider - It appears from the top left or right of the player area. Its role is basically the same as in "Centipede". It will either bounce across the player's area at 45-degree angles or bounce in at a 45-degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, go to the middle at a 45-degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, then finally go to the side opposite its entrance (at a 45-degree angle), bounce up and down, then exit the area. It destroys flowers and mushrooms it passes over. In later stages, multiple Spiders will appear.

3) Bee - It can appear in any attack wave. Its role is identical to that of the Flea in "Centipede". It falls from the top of the screen to the bottom, randomly depositing mushrooms along the way. A Bee takes two shots to kill. The first shot makes it angry and causes it to speed up its descent. It will usually appear when you have cleared out most of the mushrooms in the player area.

4) Beetle - It appears randomly after the first wave. It enters from the left or right side of the screen, then goes to the bottom. It travels at least halfway along the bottom before going up to its original entry level. It then exits from the side opposite from which it entered. All mushrooms in its path are converted to flowers which are immune to the Archer's arrows. Hitting a Beetle causes the screen to go down one level. 

5) Earwig - It appears when the Millipede begins with less then eleven body segments. Its role is identical to that of the Scorpion in "Centipede". It goes across the screen and poisons any mushrooms in its path. 

6) Inchworm - It first appears when the Millipede begins with less then eleven body segments. Hitting one causes all enemies on the screen to slow down for about three seconds. 

7) Dragonfly - It appears when the Millipede begins with less then ten body segments. It goes in a zig-zag pattern from top to bottom leaving a trail of mushrooms in its wake. 

8) Mosquito - It appears when the Millipede begins with less then nine body segments. It flies in a diagonal pattern from the upper left or upper right corners. Hitting one causes the screen to go up one level.

* The Millipede will start out as a head with eleven body segments in the first wave. Wave 2 will be a head with ten body segments and a head that enters from the opposite side. Wave 3 will be a head with nine body segments and two heads that enter from opposite sides. This progression keeps going until Wave 12 where you have twelve heads. The cycle will then start over in Wave 13. This cycle occurs every 12 distinct waves.

* You must clear the first Millipede wave only once. Then, until your score reaches 20,000 points, you must complete each subsequent Millipede wave twice - first as the Millipede moves slowly towards you, then as it moves fast. After your score reaches 20,000 points, each Millipede wave will only need to be completed once.

* Shooting the Millipede can have two effects: 

1) If you shoot the head, that part turns into a mushroom and the next segment becomes the new head and the Millipede will travel in the opposite direction (since it hit the newly-created mushroom).

2) If you shoot the middle of the body, then the segment hit will become a mushroom. The existing Millipede will continue in the same direction. The new Millipede will develop a head at the next segment after the break and head off in the opposite direction. 

* A good strategy to ensure you destroy the Millipedes in one stroke and to keep the Bees at bay is to create 'mushroom corridors'. Mushroom corridors are basically corridors between two rows of mushrooms where you can funnel the Millipede down and destroy it when it is moving head-first at your Archer.

* In reference to the above 'mushroom corridors', keep in mind that after the fourth wave of each cycle, the mushrooms will undergo a period of 'Growth' that determines whether they stay alive or die in accordance with a modified version of the 'life' algorithm. The rules are as follows: 

1) Any mushroom with fewer than two neighbors dies, as if by loneliness. 

2) Any mushroom with more than three neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding. 

3) Any mushroom with two or three neighbors lives, unchanged, to the next generation. 

4) Any empty space with exactly three mushroom neighbors comes to life. 

5) Any mushroom adjacent to a DDT bomb becomes poisoned. 

6) Any non-poisoned mushroom adjacent to a poisoned mushroom dies. 

7) Flowers cannot die, but do count as neighbors towards the growth of mushrooms. 

After this period of 'Growth', you may have to clean up the area since some of your corridors may have been affected by this change. 

* Watch out for the Spiders. They enter at either the top or bottom corners. Your Archer may be in the way if this happens. In addition to collisions, the Spiders wipe out all mushrooms that are in its path. This can create problems when you are creating mushroom corridors. It can also cause Bees to appear since you won't have many mushrooms in the player area. In later rounds, multiple Spiders may appear in the player area.

* At the beginning of an attack wave, take a quick look to see how many segments the Millipede has. This will determine the behavior of enemies on that or subsequent attack waves.

* Five different times during the cycle of twelve millipede attack waves, you will be bombarded by a swarm of insects. These waves are a major source of points.

After the 2nd wave: Bee raid 
After the 6th wave: Dragonfly raid 
After the 8th wave: Mosquito raid 
After the 10th wave: Bees and Dragonflies raid together 
After the 12th wave: Bees, dragonflies, and mosquitoes raid together 

During these raids, special scoring applies for shooting Bees, Dragonflies, and Mosquitoes. Each insect kill of those types (even types not actually swarming, for example a single Bee randomly dropping during the Mosquito swarm) is worth a minimum of 100 points more than the previous kill, to a maximum of 1,000 points. Triple scoring from DDT applies as well, so DDTing a Mosquito or Dragonfly will immediately max the raid value at 1000, and DDTing a Bee will register at least 600.

It's very important not to die during one of the raids. If you stay alive, a raid can be worth up to 30,000 points later in the game. To prepare for a raid, don't shoot the last head until any Spiders and Beetles are near the side and leaving the screen. Clear a path to a DDT bomb if possible, so you can use it to kill several insects at once. It will quickly build their value to the maximum of 1000 points each.

Concentrate on one thing - shooting as many bugs as you can. Don't waste time clearing mushrooms until after the raid is over. As your score increases, the length of the raids also increases, making them worth lots of points.

* On the 9th wave, the mushrooms begin scrolling down very quickly, roughly one row every two seconds. They don't stop unless you kill the Millipede, shoot a DDT bomb, or lose a life. You have to do one of these three things quickly, or you'll be overwhelmed by mushrooms on the bottom.

First try to hit a DDT bomb. It's a good idea to clear a path to one before the wave starts. If you can't use a DDT, try to kill the Millipede before the mushrooms get too low. As a last resort, die on purpose.

The scrolling wave follows the Mosquito raid. If you can shoot a lot of Mosquitoes in the raid, the mushrooms scroll way up the screen, and you'll have plenty of time to kill the Millipede while the mushrooms come back down. Remember, if you scroll the mushrooms way up the screen, you won't be able to fire very fast. You'll have to take single shots, making sure you hit the Millipede each time.

* You can have a maximum of 4 DDT bombs on the screen at any given time. Wait until either the Millipede is right next to one or there is a heavy concentration of enemies before setting it off.

* Beetles can cause a lot of problems if they aren't dealt with quickly. Of course, if you have your mushroom corridor set up, they may be a blessing. Since they create flowers in their path that are immune to your Archer's arrows, this would help prevent you from shooting them accidentally. Of course, you still have to worry about the Spiders and DDT bombs.

* Keep track of where the Earwigs move across the screen. As soon as a Millipede's head hits a poisoned mushroom, it will immediately head for the bottom of the screen. The only way to stop this headlong plunge is to shoot it in the head. Unlike in "Centipede", the Millipede's head turns a different color when it is heading directly for the bottom of the screen. In the later attack waves, it is not uncommon to have multiple Earwigs going across the screen. They also provide the most points in the game. 

* If you get unlucky and let the Millipede into your area, you need to destroy it before it gets to the bottom of the player area. Once it reaches the bottom, it will ascend again and remain in the player area. If it does reach the bottom of the player area, another head will come out from the opposite side to start its back and forth march across the screen. This will continue until you destroy all the Millipede parts in the player area or until your Archer is destroyed. 

* If your Archer gets destroyed, all partially-destroyed mushrooms and all poisoned mushrooms are reset. Flowers created by Beetles are also changed back into mushrooms. You then start at the beginning of the wave you got killed on.

* Depending on the difficulty the machine is set up at, the following events occur:

1) At Easy, the Spider moves slowly up to 10,000 points. At Hard, the Spider moves slowly up to 5,000 points. 

2) At Easy, the Beetle moves slowly up to 400,000 points and four Beetles appear in each round after 500,000 points. At Hard, the Beetle moves slowly up to 300,000 points and four Beetles appear in each round after 350,000 points. 

3) At Easy, Millipede heads enter from the sides of the screen at timed intervals. At Hard, Millipede heads enter from the sides of the screen faster than at Easy.

4) Regardless of setting, the Inchworm will move faster after the player reaches 80,000 points.

5) All other enemies move at their same speeds.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 42 years ago:

Missile Command (c) 1980 Atari.

Missile Command is a one or two-player game depicting the outbreak of a nuclear war. Players must defend six cities from waves of incoming nuclear missiles by launching their own anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs) from one of three missile batteries. 

The game is played by moving a cross-hair across the sky and pressing one of three buttons to launch an ABM from the corresponding battery (either Alpha Base, Delta Base or Omega Base). Upon reaching the cross-hair the player's ABM explodes, creating a fireball that lasts for several seconds and destroys any enemy missiles that enter it. Each battery is initially armed with ten anti-ballistic missiles and becomes useless when either all of its missiles have been fired or it's been destroyed by enemy missiles. 

New enemy weapons are introduced in later levels that increase the level of difficulty; smart bombs that can evade a less than perfectly targeted missile, and bomber planes and satellites that fly across the screen and launch missiles of their own. Missiles from the player's central battery fly to their targets at much greater speed and are the most effective way of destroying smart bombs from a distance.

Enemy weapons are only able to destroy a maximum of three cities per level. A level ends once all enemy missiles have either been destroyed or have reached their target. At the conclusion of a level, players receive bonus points for any remaining cities and unused missiles. Between levels, missile batteries are rebuilt and replenished, while destroyed cities are only rebuilt at set point thresholds (determined by the game's dip switch settings).

The game ends once all cities have been destroyed.

- CAST OF ELEMENTS - 

Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABM): The defensive missiles you launch to protect your cities. Each missile base contains 10 ABMs per wave. If any missile base is struck by an attack missile or smart bomb, the remaining stock of ABMs for that wave are destroyed, and the missile base is rendered useless until the next wave. You receive bonus points for every ABM you have remaining at the end of each wave. 

Targeting crosshair: Aim your ABMs quickly but carefully. Use the trackball to move the targeting crosshair to where you want the next ABM to go, then press any Launch Control button to fire the ABM. The ABM will explode where the crosshair was positioned when the Launch Control button was pressed. 

Cities: There are six cities in total on the screen at one time, three on either side of the Delta Base. If one enemy missile or smart bomb manages to strike a city, that city will be wiped out. When all cities are destroyed, the game is over. 

Alpha Base: The missile base on the bottom left corner of the screen. Press the leftmost Launch Control button to launch an ABM from the Alpha base. 

Delta Base: The missile base in the bottom center of the screen. Press the middle Launch Control button to launch an ABM from the Delta base. 

Omega Base: The missile base on the bottom right corner of the screen. Press the rightmost Launch Control button to launch an ABM from the Omega base. 

NOTE: The Alpha and Omega bases launch ABMs at a slower speed than the Delta base, so you must plan further ahead when launching ABMs from those bases. 

Attack Missiles: Their only aim is to destroy your cities and missile bases. Every missile wave starts off with a hailstorm of attack missiles. They never deviate from their path. They may, however, turn into MIRVs. 

Multiple Independently-targeted Re-entry Vehicles (MIRV): Surprise! There is no warning when an attack missile turns into an MIRV (with multiple warheads). Think fast. Each new missile that the MIRV unleashes is carefully targeted. 

Killer Satellite: A mean-looking satellite that travels across the sky at a mid-level altitude and fires attack missiles. First appears in Wave 2. 

Bomber: A big slow-moving target that flies across the sky at a mid-level altitude, but watch out! It fires attack missiles. First appears in Wave 2. 

WARNING: If you destroy a bomber or killer satellite before they deploy their attack missiles, you may see their attack missiles added to the downpour. An existing attack missile may also turn into an MIRV. 

Smart Bomb: Smart enough to avoid most explosion clouds from your ABMs. Your ABM must explode next to one in order to destroy it. You can also squeen it between two explosions to destroy it. First appears in Wave 5. 

'LOW' Warning: As soon as there are only three ABMs left in a missile base, the game displays the word 'LOW' underneath that base, and a warning signal sounds. Heed the warning.

- TECHNICAL -

Missile Command is available in four different cabinet models: upright, cabaret, cocktail, and cockpit. The cockpit model only supports 1 player, while all others support up to 2 players. 

After every two attack waves, the color scheme changes. There are ten different color schemes in all. After Waves 19 and 20, the game returns to the first color scheme. Notice that the sky remains black for the first four color schemes, and starts changing its color with the fifth scheme.

- TRIVIA -

Missile Command was released on June 15, 1980 in the USA.

Licensed to Sega &amp; Taito for the Japanese market. 

The Upright and Cockpit versions of Missile Command were the last games to use the large 4.5-inch aluminum trackball that was also used by "Atari Football", "Atari Basketball", "Atari Baseball" and "Atari Soccer". The Cabaret and Cocktail versions used the smaller 2.5-inch trackball that would be used by later Atari titles, especially "Centipede".

Missile Command was an immensely popular arcade game that combined great game play with a rather chilling message about the dangers of war. Approximately 20,000 units were produced. 

Originally called 'Armaggedon', Missile Command was designed at a time that the United States and Russia were locked in a fierce 'cold war'. Missile Command was originally going to have a large status panel as part of its marquee which indicated the status of the bases and cities but it was eliminated when the designers learned that players lost track of on-screen gameplay when they looked up at the panel. There is a picture of a prototype cabinet with the status panel on page 60 of the book 'High Score: The Illustrated History of Electronics Games, 2nd Edition'. 

* The Creation of Missile Command: The idea for Missile Command began with a magazine story about satellites that captured the attention of Atari's president, who passed the clipping to Lyle Rains. Rains asked Dave Theurer to lead the effort in creating the classic, action-packed arcade game. 

* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters: Recalling the birth of Missile Command, Dave Theurer said: "The request was for a game where there are missiles attacking the California coast and the player is defending the coast. They said, take it from here and write up a game proposal. In the first proposal it was the California coast." 

Part of creating a great game is knowing what to strip away. Some of the first baggage the developers dropped was geographic identifications because of the frightful scenario of the game. And then they stripped away more. 

Dave Theurer: "The original suggestion was for there to be a scanning radar, but I immediately said, no way! It would be just too hard for the player because he wouldn't be able to see what was going on. We chucked that idea. And when we first developed the game, we added railroads to transport missiles from the cities to the missile bases. That got to be too complicated and people got confused... if you get too complicated, people won't play. We also had submarines for a while but that didn't work out so we ripped them out, too." 

The smart bombs presented the most difficult challenge in writing the code for Missile Command. 

Dave Theurer: "These little diamond-shape guys can evade your explosions. The only way you can kill them is if the explosion starts out right on top of them. Programming that was the hardest part. They had to be intelligent because the little guy had to look around on the screen to see what he had to avoid and he had to figure out the best path to go around what there was to avoid. Of course, if I made it too smart, then the player couldn't kill it and they'd be guaranteed instant death. So it had to be a fine line between smarter than the dumb missiles, yet not totally unkillable." 

Nerves of steel is the way Rich Adam, one of the Missile Command team members, described his co-worker: "Dave Theurer was extremely detail oriented, very thorough, and very disciplined. He had nerves of steel, would never get rattled, and worked tirelessly. You need nerves of steel because if your code doesn't work it's your fault, something inside that code is not correct. There's really nowhere to hide. The real Achilles' heel with a lot of software people, I believe, is that they spin their wheels and they go through this denial phase: 'It can't be my code! How could anything possibly be wrong with it? My code is so straightforward!' Well, it's so straightforward you might not have thought of a nuance. So, that's why it takes nerves of steel, I think. The work requires sort of a cold, methodical approach to the software." 

* Popular from the Start: Even before it shipped, Missile Command had intense fans. 

Speaking of the play, the game got just within the labs of Atari. Ed Rotberg said: "There were guys there that would literally have to worship that game for hours at a time. Their hands were sweating, and it was a definite adrenaline rush." 

Describing some of the dedicated players at Atari, Dave Theurer said: "We were in the same building as the consumer division and there were a couple of guys from that division who would come down and spend all day playing Missile Command. I don't know what they did upstairs, but they would spend the entire day playing the game." 

* The Great 25-Cent Escape: The escape from reality could sometimes have frightful consequences. The horrifying subject matter of Missile Command had an impact on the developers. 

Dave Theurer: "It was pretty scary. During the project and for 6 months after the project, I'd wake up in a cold sweat because I'd have these dreams where I'd see the missile streak coming in and I'd see the impact. I would be up on top of a mountain and I'd see the missiles coming in, and I'd know it would be about 30 seconds until the blast hit and fried me to a crisp." 

Steve Calfee: "Everybody I know who really got into the game had nightmares about nuclear war." 

The game was nearly shipped with a name that carried the message of the end of the world... Armageddon. 

Steve Calfee: "We had this big thing about the name of the game. From the beginning, it was called Armageddon. The management, themselves, didn't know what the word meant and they thought none of the kids would. Then we went through this big thing of naming it. Engineering loved the name Armageddon, and we always wanted to call it that. From the very top came the message, 'We can't use that name, nobody'll know what it means, and nobody can spell it.'" 

Placing the game in the context of the previous decade, Ed Rotberg said: "The thing about Missile Command is that the world was not nearly as stable politically as it is now. There is a little bit of a spooky message in that whole game when you have that final cloud at the end." 

Victor Ali holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 80,364,995 points. 

Roy Shildt holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 1,695,265 points. 

Hacks of this game are known as "Super Missile Attack" and "Missile Combat". 

A Missile Command unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day' and in the 1995 movie 'Species'. 

A Missile Command upright cabinet appears in the Judas Priest music video 'Freewheel Burning'. The game's THE END screen appears at the end of the video. 

In 1982, a multi-player sequel was planned but never released. This game would have have been identical to the first except with twice as many cities and batteries and the players cooperating to save each other cities from the onslaught. 

In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

- SCORING -

Points are awarded for destroying attack missiles, ships and planes: 
Attack Missile: 25 points 
Killer Satellite: 100 points 
Bomber: 100 points 
Smart Bomb: 125 points 

Bonus points are awarded at the end of each missile wave for any cities and ABMs remaining: 
Unused ABMs: 5 points each 
Saved Cities: 100 points each 

A scoring multiplier based on the missile wave being played is displayed at the start of each wave: 
Waves 1 and 2 have 1x scoring. 
Waves 3 and 4 have 2x scoring. 
Waves 5 and 6 have 3x scoring. 
Waves 7 and 8 have 4x scoring. 
Waves 9 and 10 have 5x scoring. 
Waves 11 and above have 6x scoring.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Anticipate. Place the targeting crosshair ahead of attack missiles so the explosion cloud expands toward the enemy's shots. If the leading edge of an attack missile touches any part of the explosion cloud, it is destroyed. 

* A well-placed ABM can destroy two or more attack missiles converging into the same explosion cloud. 

* Aim just in front of attack missiles, satellites, and bombers, and let them travel into your explosion clouds. As soon as you've launced an ABM and marked the target for destination, move the crosshair to another target. Don't wait for the explosion. 

* Hit bombers and killer satellites before they can drop attack missiles. Also, the sooner you destroy them, the sooner they'll reappear and the more points you can score. You may want to launch "insurance" ABM's at the left and right sides of the screen even before a bomber or killer satellite appears, in the chance that one will travel into the explosion cloud. 

* A sound tactic used by many expert players is the spread. Fire a sweeping barrage of ABMs across the screen just below the attack missiles at the start of a wave, creating a solid line of explosion clouds to trap and destory as many of the first shots fired by the enemy as possible. If possible, create the spread in the path of a bomber or killer satellite. 

* When creating a spread, fire all your ABMs from the same base. Once all 10 ABMs are launched (or the base has been destroyed by the enemy), you no longer need to worry about defending it. 

* When creating a spread, don't use the Delta Base. It is in a strategic position and its missiles fly faster than ABMs from the side bases. Save the Delta Base's ABMs for more precise shots. 

* Destroy attack missiles while they are high on the screen. You don't want them to turn into MIRVs. If you notice that an attack missile has become an MIRV, try to destroy as many of the split missiles with a single explosion cloud as possible. 

* Hit targets before they cross the radar line. The radar line is an invisible line marking the crosshair's lower limit. Since you can't position the crosshair below this line, any attack missile that crosses it is beyond range of your ABMs. 

* There are usually two main attack waves per stage. Just when it looks like things have calmed down, another assault commences. Repeating the strategy above is a good idea. 

* Smart bombs are usually fooled by a couple of quick ABMs being fired on opposite sides of the bomb, but overlapping. Then the smart bomb cannot escape. 

* Don't let smart bombs distract you. Sometimes you can try so hard to hit smart bombs you forget to defend your planet. Remember that a smart bomb can only hit one target. 

* Don't defend depleted missile bases or destroyed cities. Concentrate your efforts defending cities and missile bases that still show signs of life. If all your cities are destroyed or you are on the verge of earning a bonus city, then it is good strategy to go for the high-score targets like smart bombs, even if they are heading for dirt. 

* As waves become more difficult, you may be forced to sacrifice some cities. Choose the left or the right, and give up the cities on the other side. When waves become really tough, you may want to defend only one city and go for as many high score targets as possible.

Mortal Kombat (c) 1992 Midway.

Mortal Kombat, first in the Mortal Kombat series, is a 1-on-1 fighting game featuring a cast of seven different characters. Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom's seminal Street Fighter II, such as the game's special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against. 

Mortal Kombat characters list:
JOHNNY CAGE
KANO
RAIDEN
LIU KANG
SCORPION
SUB-ZERO
SONYA BLADE

Battles are fought over the best of three rounds. At the end of a battle, a voice instructs the winner to 'Finish Him/Her!' and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character's 'fatality', which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.

- TRIVIA -

Mortal Kombat was released on October 8th, 1992 in the USA. It was renowned as the first fighting game to use digitized characters and blood (as opposed to the hand-animated, more cartoon-like graphics of competing games). Mortal Kombat was developed as a reaction to the popular Capcom game "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", with simpler controls and digitized graphics. Some say the game's graphic violence was gratuitous, and was only included in order to generate a public outcry and controversy that would increase publicity for the game. 

Although highly controversial, the mix of realism and violence propelled Mortal Kombat to the height of popularity. An example of the game's innovations was the Fatality, a special finishing move executed against a dying opponent to create an even more gruesome death. For example, one character would grasp a defeated, wobbling opponent by the head, then rip the head and spine out of the opponent's body, which then crumpled to the ground in a pool of blood. Another aspect of gameplay that became a recurring element in games that followed was the so-called 'juggle', where a series of moves could be executed against an opponent who was kept in mid-air by the force of the attacks, and who hence had no defense against further attacks as long as the 'juggle' could be maintained. 

The original concept of Mortal Kombat was modeled after the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie 'Bloodsport', which is a cult classic martial arts film. The character of Johnny Cage is directly modeled after Frank Dux, Van Damme's character in the movie. Johnny Cage's film-star motif is an obvious link to this. Cage also wears the same costume (plus shoes) that Van Damme's character wore in the final battle of the movie. Cage's splits punch was originally seen in Bloodsport during the fight against the Sumo wrestler. Since Midway was unable to get Van Damme for this game, they kept the same kumite/martial arts movie concept and added the Kombat story. 

Mortal Kombat arcade was the first video game to have an official release date countdown in U.S./U.K. and Australia. This momentous day was known as 'Mortal Monday'. 

The code for this game includes the ASCII string 'NOOBSAIBOT' (originally in "Mortal Kombat II" rev. 3.1), suggesting that the character may have made his first appearance here, instead of Reptile (which took up less memory). 

The heads used in the background of the Courtyard and Pit stages are actually those of the programmers themselves! The statue of Buddha in the background of the Courtyard stage was actually a lawn ornament from a neighbor's yard. 

While fighting on the Pit stage, if you look closely at the glowing moon in the background, you will sometimes see a silhouette fly past it. These shadows will either be Peter Pan and the Darling children, a witch on a broomstick, a kite, a blimp, a rocket, a flying saucer, or Santa Claus in his reindeer-pulled sleigh. The shadows appear about every 6 games. 

Liu Kang is Midway's homage to Bruce Lee. 

Raiden really is the Japanese God of Thunder. His appearance in myth is quite different though: he has red skin and a demonic face, his feet have two claws on them, and he carries either a wheel or drums on his back. He also is thought to eat human navels so people are advised to lie on their stomachs during storms. 

Kano make an appearance on the 2012 animation movie 'Wreck-It Ralph' from Walt Disney Animation Studios.

In the Palace Gates stage, above the red door on the right side, you can see Pac-Man, a ghost and a power pellet carved on the stone. 

A hacked version also exists - every stage had a black/night sky and every time you got frozen by Sub-Zero, your fighter would rise up and stay there 'till you either got hit or the freezing effect went away. The same thing would happen if you were using Sub-Zero and froze your opponent. The machine would boot up just like a regular MK machine boots up, except another black screen with red letters and asterisks labeling it as "Mortal Kombat Black Ninja Edition" was displayed before the title screen. 

A Mortal Kombat unit appears in the 1995 movie 'The Doom Generation'. 

Midway released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Mortal Kombat II: Music from the Arcade Game Soundtrack - 123770-C1) on December 1, 1993. 

Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.

The Premium Pack and Kollector's editions of "Mortal Kombat - Deception" for the Sony PlayStation 2 and Microsoft XBOX, respectively, both released on October 4, 2004 in North America, contain a bonus disc containing an arcade-perfect version of the original game.

Mortal Kombat II (c) 1993 Midway Mfg. Co.

Mortal Kombat II is a direct sequel to the 1992 original featuring new fighters (increasing the character roster from 7 to 12) and improved graphics. 

As with its predecessor, MKII's matches are divided into rounds, with victory awarded to the first player to win two rounds. At the point of defeat, the losing fighter will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity to execute a 'finishing move'. 

Some of the standard fighting moves (moves shared by all characters) have now been expanded or enhanced. A crouching punch has been added and the 'roundhouse kick' is more powerful and now knocks opponents across the screen. Also, the difference in hit boxes between high and low kicks is now more marked. 

Additionally, returning characters gain new special moves and MKII marks the first appearance of multiple Fatalities - as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves - in the series. In addition to the Fatalities of its predecessor, MKII offers 'Babalities' (turning a defeated opponent into a crying baby), 'Friendships' (a non-malicious interaction, such as dancing or giving a gift to the defeated opponent) and stage-specific Fatalities (the winner uppercutting their opponent into an abyss below, spikes above, or a pool of acid in the background). 

Each character still shares generic attributes - speed, power, jump height and airtime - albeit with differing hit boxes. The sequel drops the points system of its prequel in favor of a consecutive win tally.

- TRIVIA -

Mortal Kombat II was released in June 1993 in USA.

MKII was the first Midway release to use the DCS Sound System. 

'Noob Saibot' backwards spells 'Boon' and 'Tobias' who are the names of the principle game designers. 

'Jax' was originally supposed to be in the original "Mortal Kombat" game and named Kurtis Stryker. Jax was then moved to MKII and the Stryker character debuted in "Mortal Kombat 3". 

'Kintaro' was originally intended to be a humanoid tiger, similar to the creature in Japanese mythology. This idea was scrapped, however, due to the fact that creating the costume would not have been feasable. However, thanks to this original idea, the Shokan we know as Kintaro has the tiger stripes on his back. 

Real life: Philip Ahn, who played the regenerated Shang Tsung, is in fact a doctor. 

Three of the cast members for MKII filed a lawsuit against Midway shortly after the game was released. The claim? The physical instructors/martial artists Elizabeth Malecki (Sonya Blade), Catalin Zamiar (Kitana/Milenna) and Philip Ahn were under the impression that they were hired under typical acting contracts and were entitled to a small modicum of benefits including royalties of title sales, etc. The plaintiffs banded together against Midway, who took the case to court. Eventually the judge failed on Midway's behalf, citing that the work done by the plaintiffs for Midway was done strictly as a 'work-for-hire' and Midway owned all the property and benefits on the characters/titles/etc. As a consequence, all three left the project, and were recast for "Mortal Kombat 3". 

SFII / MK2: both games were supposed to be released within weeks of each other (at this time, "Street Fighter" and "Mortal Kombat" were the dominant fighting games). Capcom released "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" early so that they could attract fans away from MK. At the same time, Midway released MK2 early for similar reasons. As you can see, the result meant that both came back to square one.

One of Jade's clues references Chun Li from Street Fighter "Chun who?"

'Friendships' and 'Babalities' (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more info) in MKII were used in making light of the violence controversy in the first "Mortal Kombat" game. 

Two non-existent hidden characters were 'Torch', and 'Hornbuckle'. In MKII there is a location called 'The Pit II'. Far in the background of this stage there is another bridge across the chasm. Standing stationary on this bridge are two fighters: one of them is a Liu Kang sprite with green pants who was named Hornbuckle by fans. One of Jade's hints was 'Hornbuckle who?', which people thought was the name of a hidden fighter, and was apparently given to the guy opposite 'Torch' on The Pit II. If you watch the ending credits, one of the programmers' last names is Hornbuckle. The other fighter is a humanoid character that seems to be made of fire. As these two characters never move, it has been suggested that the 'other fighter' is actually a funeral pyre. Finally, there is a cloaked figure who floats in front of the window during fights in The Tower and Portal stages in MKII. This character was dubbed Cloak by fans, and was assumed to be a hidden character. The character of Torch, who had been very popular with fans, eventually showed up as a playable character in "Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance". Unfortunately, due to trademark issues, he had to be called Blaze instead of Torch. The true identity of Cloak was revealed in "Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks" to be one of Shang Tsung's servants, a shadow priest. 

The head that occasionally appears after an uppercut and says 'Toasty' is the digitized head of Dan Forden who worked on the sound and music for the game.

Ed Boon's face was superimposed onto the trees for the Living Forest stage.

Jimmy Cardenas holds the official record for this game with 282,000 points. 

Midway released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Mortal Kombat II: Music from the Arcade Game Soundtrack - 123770-C1) on December 1, 1993.

An arcade-perfect emulation of this game is an unlockable feature in "Mortal Kombat - Shaolin Monks" for the Sony PlayStation 2 and Microsoft XBOX.

Popular pirate hacks of MK2 are known as:
"Mortal Kombat II 4.2"
"Mortal Kombat II 9.1"
"Mortal Kombat II Challenger.."

- TRIVIA -

Mortal Kombat 3 (MK3) was released in March 1995 in USA.

MK3 was the first Mortal Kombat game to have bi-level battlefields, which lets players uppercut their opponent to the level above them when fighting on certain levels. 

MK3 was also the first Mortal Kombat arcade game that did not include Scorpion, and, according to series co-creator Ed Boon, the last. 

MK3 also introduced the RUN button, accompanied by a RUN meter, allowing the character to run. This was primarily to address concern from fans who thought that the previous games gave too much of an advantage to the defending player. 

MK3 introduced the Kombat Kodes, which were 6 digit codes entered at the VS screen in a 2-Player game to modify gameplay, fight hidden characters or display certain text messages. 

MK3 also introduced the Ultimate Kombat Kode, which was a 10 digit code that could be entered after a game was over in single player mode. If the correct code was entered, Smoke would become a permanent playable character on the character select screen. The arcade owner, however, could reset this code by accessing the game's diagnostic menu by hitting a DIP switch within the MK3 cabinet. 

MK3 introduced the chain combos, also known as dial-a-combos (many other fighting games at the time had similar combo systems). These supplement the existing juggle combo system, but critics contend that dial-a-combos are redundant and needlessly add to the learning curve of the game. 

MK3 introduced the long-rumored Animality, where the character transforms into an animal in order to kill their opponent. 

MK3 also introduced 'Mercy', allowing a beaten foe to recover a sliver of life and continue fighting. This was necessary to perform an Animality. 

MK3 was the first game of the series to use distinct blood colors depending on the character; the human characters and Shao Kahn had traditional red blood, Sheeva, and Motaro had green blood, while the three robotic ninjas had black blood. 

MK3 was the first game of the series to have a playable Shokan character; Sheeva possessed unique corpse spirits (skeletons, etc.) that other player characters shared. 

MK3 was also the first Mortal Kombat arcade game to feature player-selectable difficulty; previous games' difficulty settings were set by the machine operator. 

It was the first Mortal Kombat game to feature Sub-Zero unmasked. 

The early names for the Graveyard and the Bell Tower stages were 'The Boonyard' and 'Tobias Tower', respectively, but criticism regarding the oversaturation of Boon's and Tobias' names in the game soon surfaced, resulting in both levels being quickly renamed with their generic descriptions. 

Many of the new characters weren't officially named till late in the production of the game. During production, Sektor and Cyrax's names were Ketchup and Mustard (respectively), due to their coloration, while Sindel bore the odd moniker of Muchacha and The Bride. Kabal, meanwhile, was nicknamed Sandman possibly due to Kabal's inspiration coming from the Tusken Raiders of Star Wars fame. At some point, it has also been rumored that Sektor and Cyrax are, in fact, Scorpion and Reptile, who were forced to transplant their souls from their original physical bodies into mechanical substance and act like a supreme clade of Outworld robot warriors. When "Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3" came out, these proved to be false. 

The Graveyard stage contains gravestones with the last names of MK3's entire design team: Ed Boon, John Tobias, Dan Forden, John Vogel, Tony Goskie, and Dave Michicich. For each round, four of these names will appear randomly on each of the four closest gravestones. Each gravestone also has each person's date of birth as well as the "alleged" date they died, which is April 1, 1995, the day the first version of MK3 was released in the arcades. A gravestone in the background can also be seen reading "Cage", making reference to Johnny Cage being deceased (at the time). 

Originally, the character Kurtis Stryker was supposed to appear in MK1, but was scrapped early in the development process when beta tests revealed a player interest in a female character in the game, which led to Sonya replacing Stryker. In MK2, Kurtis Stryker almost made it to the final game, but finally had his name changed to... Jax. For MK3, a new Kurtis Stryker is created and is finally made part of a MK game. 

The head that occasionally appears after an uppercut or combo and says 'Toasty' is the digitized head of Dan Forden who worked on the sound and music for the game. 

Smoke's icon is a version of Sektor's icon. 

Midway / Toasty Productions released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Musik: MK3 &amp; MK4 Arcade Video Game Soundtrack) on January 1, 1997.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 42 years ago:

Moon Cresta (c) 1980 Nichibutsu

Moon Cresta is a single screen shoot-em-up with the player controlling an armed ship that moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen and must use their ship to destroy waves of attacking aliens. 

The player begins the game with a small ship armed with a single laser cannon. Upon successful completion of the first four waves of alien attacks, the player's ship will be able to dock with the next 'stage' of fighter ship, although the docking procedure must be completed within a set time. This larger, two-stage ship has increased fire power (three lasers).

After successfully clearing a further two alien waves and surviving a meteor shower, the two-stage ship will be able to dock with the third and final piece, giving the player the largest and most powerful ship, which is now armed with five lasers. Bonus points are awarded depending on how quickly the docking procedures are completed.

If the multi-stage ship is hit, the player continues with whatever stages remain. If players achieve a score of 30,000, they are awarded a free game and their score continues to accumulate.

Upon completion of the first eight screens, the player's ship will revert back to its small, single-stage incarnation and the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty.

- SCORING -

Scoring in this game is relatively simple. Each alien (except meteors and arrows) come in two different colors for each screen.
Eyes (Break in half): 50 points
Eyes (Destroy other half): 100 points
Flies: 30 points
Birds: 60 points
Fireballs: 200 points
Arrow Ships: 100 points

Docking is a big way to increase your score. You get the time remaining from 30 seconds multiplied by 100 for your docking bonus.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, all three stages of your ship will come from the bottom of the screen. After going halfway up, the ship on top separates from the other 2 and it settles onto the bottom of the screen ready for battle.

* Remember, you can only keep one set of shots in the 'air' at one time. This means you need to plan your shots out so you don't end up with a lot of misses when the aliens decided to come after your ship.

* In the later screens, the aliens start moving much quicker and you have to be on your toes to keep up with them and avoid being taken out.

* Although the aliens do not fire, they still can cause a lot of hate and discontent by their wild maneuvering. There is no real safe place on the screen from the aliens since they go into the lower corners of the screen, reappear from the bottom after they have apparently 'left' the screen, or just appear right above your ship.

* In the earlier waves, you have to split apart 2 eyes before the rest automatically split and come after your ship. In the later screens, the eyes automatically split upon entering the screen. That means eight instead of four aliens you have to deal with.

* If you manage to dock all three ships together, you will have a lot of firepower (5 shots at once) to send out. Here are some ways, unfortunately, you can lose ships and what ships are lost:
1) Besides the aliens, docking is the second way people lose a lot of ships. The only ship destroyed is the ship attempting to dock.
2) If an alien hits any part of your ships (if all stages are joined), only the stage hit is lost. This can create an amusing circumstance if you lose stage II and you only have stages I and III to fight with.

* Don't worry if you lose Stage I early in the game. One has to be very skilled to fight four screens with Stage I. Stage II is the best stage to fight with. It is a small target plus it has enough firepower to defend itself. Stage III on the other hand, is just a lumbering junkyard. The lasers are too spread out to do much good plus there is a very wide-open area in the middle for aliens to hit.

* The bird stages present the most challenge of the aliens. They appear and disappear at will. Sometimes they will appear right next to your ship so on these stages, be extra alert. If you see one disappear and don't hear the familiar bird chirp of it reappearing, assume it is on the screen somewhere still.

* The best place to 'hide' during the fireball stage is in the lower right corner. The fireballs will not hit your ship in this corner. You can do hit and runs by moving your ship out, shooting at a fireball, then going back to the corner again.

* During the arrow screen, the aliens will hover around the top, then turn into arrows and attempt to ram your ship. In the later screens, they won't even hover but just try to ram your ship.

* Your goal is to make it to 30,000 points so you can have a fresh ship waiting in case you lose all the stages of your present ship.

* Docking isn't that hard to do. After finishing off a wave just before the docking stage, try to center your ship on the screen. That way, all you have to do is move that ship left or right to successfully dock. You want to avoid using the thrusters unless your ship is in extreme peril. The docking bonus can be the most amount of points you score in the game. If you happen to miss a dock, then you will continue the next set of screens with the ship that failed to dock.

		<name>Moon Patrol</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Moon Patrol (c) 1982 Irem.

Moon Patrol is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player takes the role of a Luna City police officer assigned to Sector Nine, home of the toughest thugs in the galaxy. 

The player controls a moon buggy that travels over the moon's surface, trying to avoid or destroy any obstacles in its path, including craters, rocks and mines. UFOs attack the buggy from above by dropping bombs, some UFO bombs will create a new crater when they hit the ground, generating a new obstacle to avoid.

The buggy can jump to avoid craters, mines and rocks, it also has both front and vertically-mounted cannons that fire missiles simultaneously. The vertical cannon is to destroy UFOs while the front-cannon can take out obstacles that lie in the buggy's path.

Moon Patrol has five different stages spread over 26 check-points, each designated a letter of the English alphabet. The five checkpoints that denote a new stage are E, J, O, T and Z and each new stage sees a change in background graphics as well as an increase in difficulty. One example of this is the introduction of landmines in the third stage (stage 'J').

A status panel is displayed at the top of the screen that gives the player useful information. A progress bar showing the five major checkpoints and the player's current position is displayed at the bottom of the panel. Above the progress bar is an indicator of the current checkpoint, the time spent in the stage and three indicator lights: the top light indicates upcoming enemy aerial attacks, the middle one indicates an upcoming minefield and the bottom one indicates enemies approaching from behind.

At the end of each stage bonus points are awarded based on how quickly the stage was completed.

*CAST OF CHARACTERS*

PLAYER CHARACTER - MOON BUGGY: 
Your vehicle across the rugged lunar terrain is a specially designed moon buggy. It comes with six wheels on three specially mounted axles that contain especially absorbent shocks which allow the buggy to glide across the uneven landscape of the moon. The wheels of the buggy can be utilized to create short hops, which allow the buggy to jump over pits and other hazardous obstacles that can't be removed in time. It is also equipped with a roof mounted gun for anti-air fire and a forward mounted cannon. The anti-air gun can fire up to four bullets on the screen at one time, while the cannon can only project one bullet at a time. The buggy is destroyed by impact with an obstacle, getting hit by alien craft bombs, or falling into a lunar pit.

ENEMIES ON THE GROUND
1) Craters and Rocks - Throughout the course of driving on the moon, you will encounter natural terrain obstacles that you must overcome. Nothing more can be done about craters than jumping over them. Most craters are spaced out, but a few come in rapid succession of one another, so jumps must be timed carefully. In addition to craters, you will come across rocks on the landscape. Most rocks are easily dispatched with one shot from your cannon. Sometimes, two rocks occur back to back. If you're fast enough, you can destroy them both. Otherwise, you may opt to jump over the pair. Small rocks lie below the height of your cannon fire. They can only be destroyed if the shot from your cannon detonates near the rock. Otherwise, the shot will sail harmlessly over the rock. When in doubt, jump over the rocks to be safe.

2) Land Mines - These small objects which flash white and red make their first appearance after point J in the beginner course. Like pits, they can not be destroyed and must be jumped over. They tend to occur in rapid succession, so it is recommended that you travel no faster than regular speed until you are an expert player. When two mines are approximately two moon buggy lengths apart, it is important to jump over the first one considerably early so that you don't land on the second, and have enough time to jump off the ground before you reach it.

3) Boulders - At certain points along your patrol, the elevation of the moon's surface rises. The first such occurrence is between points P and Q in the beginner course. While you are driving uphill, it is not uncommon to encounter boulders rolling down towards your buggy. Like rocks, these boulders can be rendered harmless with your cannon. Even the small boulders present little challenge thanks to the incline of the surface elevating them to the level of your cannon. But be prepared for a difficult jump if too many come at you at once and you don't have enough time to destroy them all.

4) Tanks - These first appear after point U in the beginner course. They are stationary, and typically fire one bullet at a time in your direction. Their bullets and the shots from your cannon cancel each other out, so you must immediately fire again in order to hit the tank. Any delay on your part will result in the tank firing once more, preventing you from destroying the tank before you reach it. Tanks can be jumped over if necessary.

5) Rocket Cars - The first of these appears after point A in the champion course. It will trail behind you until it is ready to strike. Stay fast, and don't do anything until it begins to approach you. When it is half-way between you and the edge of the screen, jump up and let it sail underneath you. Fire as soon as you land to destroy it for 500 points. 

6) Space Plants - A strange type of vegetation exists on the moon, favouring to make their homes in the craters of the lunar surface. They bob in and out of the craters in an effort to catch whatever they can grab. These space plants first appear shortly before point H in the champion course. A shot from the cannon is enough to render the space plant harmless, but the crater must still be leaped over. Attempting to leap over a crater that still contains a space plant can be a dangerous gamble if not timed perfectly.

ENEMIES IN THE AIR
Alien Craft: There are three types of craft that the enemy employs when trying to defeat you from overhead. They all appear in groups ranging from two to five.

1) Regular Craft - These weave back and forth dropping bombs on the buggy. The bombs can be destroyed with your anti-air gun, but they make difficult targets. If this craft is left on the screen for too long in later levels, it may fly down to collide with your buggy.

2) Elliptical craft - These behave nearly identical to the regular craft. They drop bombs on you with increasing accuracy. The long you remain at a particular speed, the better their shots will get, so make sure to mix your speed up in order to confuse them. Sometimes, you can jump at the last minute and avoid getting hit if the bomb is about to hit the back of your buggy.

3) Tri-orb craft - This craft, made of three circles bound together, is the deadliest of them all. Rather than dropping normal bombs at the buggy, they pitch terrain deforming grenades at the path ahead of you. You must watch the trajectory of their small flashing grenades and anticipate when you might need to jump as a result of the newly formed pit left by their grenade's impact with the ground. Like the bombs, the grenades can be shot, but they are even harder to hit.

- TRIVIA -

Moon Patrol was released in June 1982 in Japan.

Moon Patrol was one of the earliest linear side-scrolling shoot-em-ups and the first game to feature parallax scrolling.

Some graphical glitches:

* Shoot an alien ship as it falls and it remains on the screen, with its point total.

* Bombs dropped in pits explode on the surface.

* Occasionally you'll miss an enemy you appear to hit, but it works the other way around, too.

* Occasionally the enemy missiles will hit your very edge and nothing will happen. Don't get too used to this happening, though!

* When you jump but still fall in a pit, you always make it halfway between the edge before falling in.

The attract mode course uses its own unique course of gameplay. The screen, however, says 'Beginner course' at the top when the moon buggy is parked at the moon base. The enemies encountered in attract mode are as follows:

(Moon base)
Large (double) rock, Large crater, 2 space plants (the second space plant has a rock adjacent to it), Large crater, Small crater, 2 tanks

(Point A)
Uphill climb with rolling boulders, Formation of 3 regular alien crafts, Formation of 3 tri-orb crafts

(Point B)
Downhill descent with formation of 3 elliptical alien crafts

(Point C)
Rocket car, Large crater and small crater adjacent to each other
(Unfortunately, the moon buggy always falls into the large crater that follows the rocket car, so technically the attract mode course ends there. Sometimes the alien craft between points A and C would defeat the moon buggy; other times the moon buggy would mistime its jump over the rocket car. The land mines do not appear in the attract mode).

Mark Robichek holds the official record for this game with 1,214,600 points.

A Moon Patrol unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid'.

A Bootleg of this game is called "Moon Ranger".

Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (R*Type: Irem Game Music - 28XA-199) on January 25, 1988.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Enemies that appear in later stages also appear in the attract mode. If you watch the attract mode carefully, you'll learn how to deal with these adversaries.

Moon Patrol is primarily divided into 2 courses; the Beginner course and the Champion course. Each course is divided into 26 sections labelled A through Z. Each section is organized into 4 groups of 5 and 1 group of 6 at the very end. At the end of each group, your time is compared to the average time for potential bonus points.

BEGINNER COURSE

A - E
 
In the very first stretch, you will encounter 3 small craters, and 2 rocks. Jump over all of the craters and fire your cannon at the rocks. 

Point A 
By the time you drive over point A, 2 of the first alien crafts will appear overhead. They will be joined by two of the elliptical crafts. A rock will appear towards the end. 

Point B 
2 more crafts appear while a rock approaches your buggy. A few more rocks and a crater will follow. 

Point C 
3 elliptical crafts will appear. Destroy them for a 500 point bonus while you jump over the 2 craters and destroy the rock. 

Point D 
2 tri-orbs will introduce themselves. Be careful of the craters that their grenades might make. They are quickly followed by 2 regular crafts. One rock and one crater precedes the end.

F - J

Point E 
The section begins with 2 tri-orbs followed by 2 elliptical crafts. A crater and rock appear towards the end. 

Point F 
More difficult obstacles appear, such as large craters, double rocks that must be fired on twice, and small rocks that must be hit by the explosion of the cannon shot. 

Point G 
2 craft appear while you jump over large craters and destroy a few rocks that get in your way. 

Point H 
There are simply 2 tri-orbs and 2 regular crafts in this section. 

Point I 
The first group of three tri-orbs will appear. Destroy them all for 500 points. Then a rapid succession of craters and rocks will occur, including double and small rocks. You may wish to slow down towards the end to deal with them all. 

K - O

Point J 
This section introduces you to land mines, the small objects that flash white and red. Like craters, they can not be destroyed and must be jumped over. They tend to occur in rapid succession, so it is recommended that you travel no faster than regular speed until you are an expert player.

Point K 
More land mines in this section. When 2 land mines are approximately 2 buggy lengths apart, it is important to jump over the first one considerably early so that you don't land on the second, and have enough time to jump off the ground before you reach it. 

Point L 
Many of the land mines you encounter here come in pairs, but they are no more difficult to jump at regular speed than single mines. 

Point M 
Space craft resume their attack and this time 4 of the regular type appear to attack. Destroy them all for an 800 point bonus. This is followed by 3 elliptical crafts, worth 500 bonus points if they are all destroyed. 

Point N 
4 tri-orbs appear, followed by 3 elliptical crafts. If you can destroy them all, you'll net a 1300 point bonus.

P - T

Point O 
A quad of tri-orbs start off this section, followed by 3 regular crafts. 

Point P 
This section is the first uphill climb that you encounter. Boulders of all three sizes will fall down the hill in no larger groups than pairs. Even the smallest boulders should be easy to shoot. 

Point Q 
4 elliptical craft appear. Be aware that their bombs don't need to travel as far in order to hit you. Also keep your eyes open for the large craters and double rock formations that show up. 

Point R 
As you begin to descend downhill, a pair of both regular space crafts will appear and bomb you from overhead. 

Point S 
3 regular crafts appear near simultaneously with 3 tri-orb craft. Stay alert to newly formed craters. 

U - Z

Point T 
A rapid succession of craters and double rocks appear. Take this section at the normal speed until you feel comfortable speeding up. 

Point U 
As soon as the craters and rock end, you will encounter your first 2 tanks. 4 more tanks are waiting for you after a large crater. Fire rapidly to overcome their bullets and destroy them. 

Point V 
A series of 4 large craters precedes an uphill climb, complete with rolling boulders.

Point W 
4 regular craft and 3 elliptical crafts appear while you're positioned closer to the sky.

Point X 
3 regular crafts are followed by 3 tri-orb crafts. 

Point Y 
3 more tri-orb crafts and 3 elliptical crafts fire from overhead while you must avoid a final series of craters and rocks to reach the end of the beginner course.


CHAMPION COURSE

A - E

3 regular craft and 3 elliptical craft bomb you from overhead at the start of the champion course. 

Point A 
Your first tangle with a rocket car will occur. It will trail behind you until it is ready to strike. Stay fast, and don't do anything until it begins to approach you. When it's half way between you and the edge of the screen, jump up and let it sail underneath you. Fire as soon as you land to destroy it. 

Point B 
A few tanks occur among craters and rock. The last tank in this section is positioned just after a large crater. It's difficult to destroy both the tank's bullet and the tank, so fire at the bullet and leap over the crater and the tank in one jump. 

Point C 
More tanks appear with short breaks of craters and rocks. 

Point D 
4 regular crafts fly in while you must continue to navigate over several deep craters and clear the rocks in your way. Destroy all of the crafts for 800 bonus points. 

F - J

Point E 
3 pairs of tri-orbs appear, providing a near constant shower of grenades. No bonus points are awarded for destroying all of the crafts because they are considered pairs. 

Point F 
A tricky succession of craters and rocks occur. They frequently occur back to back, requiring you to clear the rock in front of the crater before jumping, or forcing you to delay your jump so that you can destroy the rock behind the crater. Slow the buggy down if your jumps are landing too close to the next obstacle. 

Point G 
4 tri-orb crafts are accompanied by 4 regular crafts for a total potential bonus of 1600 points. At the very end of this section, you will be introduced to space plants. Even if you manage to destroy them, remember to jump over the craters. 

Point H 
3 of the regular and elliptical crafts appear among more craters and rocks. 

Point I 
4 tri-orb crafts arrive. Destroy them as quickly as possible before the terrain gets more difficult up ahead. Among the craters and rocks are space plants that must be dealt with. Slow the buggy down towards the end.

K - O

Point J 
This section starts off with an uphill climb. Boulders now appear more frequently and groups of three are not uncommon. Do not be determined to destroy them all. Leap over a set if they prove too difficult to shoot in time. 

Point K 
4 regular crafts and 3 elliptical crafts stream onto the screen during your higher elevation.

Point L 
Land mines begin to appear again, some in very close proximity to one another. Slow your speed down until you get the rhythm of the jumps. 

Point M 
More land mines appear. In this section, some land mine pairs are so close that it's actually possible to hurdle the combination at top speed, but this requires great familiarity with the mine sequence before attempting. 

Point N 
5 tri-orbs appear, for a unique chance at a 1000 point bonus for clearing them all. 4 regular crafts appear as well. 

P - T

Point O 
As soon as you begin your descent down the hill, five elliptical crafts swarm overhead with four regular crafts. Once you reach the bottom of the hill, a tricky combination of rocks and craters occurs, so clear the crafts as quickly as possible. 

Point P 
The craters continue to come at a relatively easy pace. A rocket car will appear while you continue to jump craters. The land will level out and eventually the rocket car will launch itself at you. Jump to avoid it, and shoot it as you land, but be ready to jump the next crater which comes up almost immediately. 

Point Q 
Rocks occur on either side of some craters now, some grouped in pairs. The very end of the section contains closely arranged land mines. 

Point R 
More rocks and craters show up, with the space plants occupying the later batch. 

Point S 
5 tri-orbs are accompanied by 3 elliptical crafts. A few rocks show up towards the end. 

U - Z

Point T 
As the section starts out, a few rocks and craters get in your way before a rocket car appears. This time, it will launch shortly after you land from a jump over a crater, so be ready to jump back up again as the car approaches. 

Point U 
A number of land mines appear. In the middle, two rocks must be destroyed. Use this as a cue to speed up quite a bit, because a pair of land mines roughly one buggy's width apart must be leaped over simultaneously and you need a good bit of speed. 

Point V 
A total of 5 tri-orb crafts and 5 regular crafts will appear to launch an attack over you. Continue to monitor forward for craters created by tri-orbs' grenades. 

Point W 
A rapid succession of craters, rocks, and space plants occur here. It is best to travel at normal or slower speed to ensure that you have time to destroy every obstacle in your way. 

Point X 
5 tri-orbs and four regular craft will dominate the sky above you. 

Point Y 
A full combination of tanks, craters, rocks, and space plants will assail you during the very final section of the champion course. 


* Hint 1: When alien ships fly over, keep adjusting your speed or they will eventually hit you with a bomb. Draw their bombs to one end of the screen, then shift to the other. 

* Hint 2: Although the part of the mines seems to be the more difficult, it isn't - all you have to do is not move your tank at all, only pressing the jump button. You won't get many bonus points, but at least you'll survive. 

* Hint 3: The big key to this game is memorization. After the beginner course, you go on to the champion course, which never changes no matter how many times you pass it. Memorize the two courses, and you will almost never lose a life.

		<name>Mr. Do!</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 39 years ago:

Mr. Do! (c) 1983 Universal.

Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do, a circus clown, who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.

Mr. Do is armed with a 'Powerball' that can be fired down a tunnel, it will then bounce around the tunnels until it either returns to Mr. Do, or comes into contact with, and kills, one of the level's monsters. The Powerball regenerates immediately the first time you use it, but takes longer each time it is used to return to your hands. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples.

Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a 'prize', (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If Mr. Do collects the prize, the 'Alphamonster' and his three 'Muncher' henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and the Munchers cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining Munchers will turn into apples.

After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game's monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, Alphamonsters, or Diamond) is shown. The paths in the first level resemble a 'D', after this each level's tunnels resemble a digit, ('2', '3', '4' etc.) up to '0' for level 10.

A level can be completed any one of several different ways: either by collecting all of the on-screen cherries; by killing all of the monsters, by completing the EXTRA box, or by collecting the diamond. The latter appears only very occasionally ('Special' awards an extra credit).

- TRIVIA -

Mr. Do! was released in September 1982 in Japan and in December 1982 in the USA. It was also licensed to Taito.

Mr. Do! was inspired by "Dig Dug" and was the first in a series of four Mr. Do! games. Mr. Do! was one of video-gaming's biggest arcade successes. Unfortunately for Universal, none of their other games could match it in commercial terms. 

It is the game responsible for launching the kit game craze in the U.S. video game industry.

David Breckon holds the official record for this game with 26,030,050 points.

A bootleg of this game is known as "Mr. Lo!", and another is called "Mr. Du!".

There are several well-known hacks of Mr Do! which are as follows:
* Mr. DigDo! - graphics changed to make them look more like those of Namco's "Dig Dug".
* Mr. Jong - Changes the clown into an old Chinese man, the monsters into clowns and the apples into mahjong blocks.
* Yankee Do! - Changes the graphics to make them more American patriotic.

- UPDATES -

On the Prototype version (which is a Japanese hack):
* You are a 'Yukidaruma' (a snowman) with green arms instead of the famous clown.
* You dig with a rake in your hands.
* There is a mean expression when you push an apple.
* The screen does not turn red when you grab cookies, cake, etc...

- SCORING -

Eating a cherry: 50 points.
Eating a series of 8 cherries in a row: 500 points bonus.
Killing a monster with your snowball: 500 points.
Killing one monster with one apple: 1,000 points.
Killing two monsters with one apple: 2,000 points.
Killing three monsters with one apple: 4,000 points.
Killing four monsters with one apple: 6,000 points.
Killing five or more monsters with one apple: 8,000 points.
Collecting special (free credit) diamond: 8,000 points.
Collecting bonus treat from empty monster home: 1,000 points on level one, increasing incremently up to a maximum of 8,000 points on level 22 onwards.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* 255 Lives Tricks: It's possible to win 255 lives on the first screen, but only if an apple appears in the top two rows of the playfield.
1) Begin by digging a tunnel directly from the bottom of the screen to just below the apple, but leave enough dirt under it that it doesn't fall.
2) Next, kill all of the enemies but one, then lose all of your extra lives. As soon as you're on your last life, go right under the apple and wait.
3) Eventually, the remaining enemy will come after you. Allow the apple to drop, but, in the interval before you're squashed, kill the enemy with the powerball. If all has gone well, you'll be carried to the bottom of the screen, the music will go haywire for a moment, and you'll be awarded 255 extra lives.
4) Note that you should always lose a life before spelling 'EXTRA', or you'll roll back to zero lives, so, to be safe, immediately kill yourself at the start of level two.
5) IMPORTANT: This trick will only work with the Taito version of Mr. Do!.

* Here's A Neat Trick: You can divide the screen into a grid. The cherries, apples, and tunnel corners are all centered on a grid element. If you are being chased by the normal badguys (not ghosts) you can dig and stop between grid elements. The badguy will think it needs to turn into a digger to get you. While he's changing forms, you can escape.

* An Alphamonster will appear every time your score reaches a multiple of 5,000.

The game involves Mr. Kougar having to eat all the dots on the screen. The dots are distributed on several moving platforms, which also are the favorites places of the Banalets, the Kougar's enemies. Touching one of the several eggs on the screen will turn Mr. Kougar invincible and will let a fairy out. The fairy will kill any enemies it touches on it's way to the top of the screen or will free a Banalet, adding one more enemy for Mr. Kougar to defeat.

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 26 years ago:

Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (c) 1996 Nazca.

A scrolling 'run-and-gun' platform game for one or two players, Metal Slug is a humorous parody of war and specifically of World War II and the Nazis.

The game features six enemy-packed levels, referred to as 'missions'. Players start the game armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons can be picked up and used for greater firepower. Also, at certain points during a level players will find an unused 'Super Vehicle-001' - or Metal Slug - tank which can be entered and driven. The Metal Slug is slow-moving but has very powerful weapons. If the Slug takes too many hits it will break down and start to flash, the player must then quickly exit the vehicle before it explodes. The enemy troops also have vehicles at their disposal, such as tanks, boats and helicopters.

The levels are littered with bearded hostages who, when rescued, award players with either points bonuses (in the form of medals) or weapon power-ups. Available weapons are Heavy Machine Gun, Flame Shot, Rocket Launcher and Shotgun. Hand grenades are also available.

Each level ends with at least one large enemy 'Boss' vehicle that takes many hits to destroy. Once the boss has been destroyed, bonus points are awarded for each prisoner rescued. Further bonus points are awarded if the player's Metal Slug vehicle has survived the boss battle.

- TRIVIA -

Metal Slug was released in April 1996. 

Etymology of 'Metal Slug': Meeher, the lead designer of the game for Nazca, wanted to create an armored fighting vehicle that could crawl on the ground like a 'slug'. The word 'metal' in the title indicates that the vehicle is mechanical. Initially, players considered the title to be "not good enough". Meeher later joked about the title, saying "Maybe I don't make much [sic] of a sense?" 

Slugs in Metal Slug sequels included animals (usually only the Vulcan cannon mounted on the animal, with a cannon attachment occasionally available), planes and other vehicles that did not fit Meeher's original definition. 

While being an obvious parody of World War II and the Nazi regime (the rebel army's flag is a deliberate pastiche of the Nazi "Swastika"), Metal Slug also lampoons 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'MASH'. General Morden, the rebel army's evil general, is a parody of Saddam Hussein. 

Just as the two main heroes (Marco &amp; Tarma) appear in every chapter in the Metal Slug series, General Morden &amp; Allen O' Neill (the machine gun wielding, trash mouth-talking, buffed soldier) are the series' classic main villains.

The tank in Metal Slug was inspired by the tank: Dominio Tank Police (1988). The tank in this anime is called Bonaparte and is piloted by Leona Ozaki.

Cliff Reese holds the official record for this game with 2,683,030 points on March 8, 2011. 

The same team that created Metal Slug had previously created a handful of games for Irem, most of which featured very similar graphics and gameplay. "Cyber Lip" (1990) had some of the core developers as the original Metal Slug. "Gunforce" (1991) and "In the Hunt" (1993) had noticeably similar gameplay, with graphics that bear a slight resemblance to Metal Slug. "Gunforce 2" (1994) not only had similar gameplay but the sounds of dying soldiers were almost exactly the same as Metal Slug. Because of this, some fans refer to Gunforce 2 as "Metal Slug Zero".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Metal Slug features a 'blood ON' option (soldiers squirt blood when shot, instead of water). This can be activated via the 'Setting The Soft Dip' option in the game's dip switch menu. 

* When you parachute into the level at the start of a mission, press B to make the parachute disappear, allowing your character to drop to the ground more quickly. 

* Don't waste ammo. Metal Slug requires some thinking and shooting indiscriminately is not the best way to play this game. 

* Don't waste special weapons on shields. Shielded soldiers will throw their shields aside when they need to fire, so shoot at them only at this instant. Or use your knife if you manage to get close enough. 

* Use your knife against lone enemies. There is no need to waste ten rounds of your Heavy Machine Gun on a single enemy soldier. 

* When Metal Slug is dangerously low on health (but not so low that you are forced to leave it), use the frontal attack to inflict major damage. 

* Whenever you jump out of the slug, you are invincible for a brief amount of time. This is especially useful against the blue mortars, since they can't be avoided. Note, however, that there is no period of invincibility when you jump back into the slug. 

* There is apparently no 'reload time' when you throw grenades or rockets. The rate depends on how many of either are currently on-screen so if you are close to an enemy, the rate will be negligible. You may use this trick against some bosses and in any other situation to pass through unscratched. 

* The best way to earn points in to rescue hostages, but this can be tricky. The first problem is finding them, the second is to stay alive to the end of the mission to get credit for your rescues. 

As well as the easily-spotted hostages that litter the levels, there are also numerous hidden hostages: 

MISSION 1 (hostages: 10): 

Two pairs of are hostages hidden in the two waterfalls just before you get to the boss. Just blast the tops of the waterfalls and they will fall. 

MISSION 2 (hostages: 12): 

Blast down at the green bush underneath the bridge just before you reach the mid level boss (large tank on rails above you) and three secret prisoners will come running in your direction. 

MISSION 3 (hostages: 15): 

There are secret hostages hidden within the two large trees that you can blast down in the section where you have the Metal Slug tank. These seem to be random, just try blasting those trees down and sometimes they appear. 

There are hidden hostages that drop down from the sky when you are fighting the end of level boss; just don't kill the boss until they have all appeared. 

MISSION 4 (hostages: 20): 

Just after you have got the Metal Slug tank at the beginning of the level, blast the ceiling of the bar just above the light/lampshade high up on the wall at the entrance of the bar. 

At the end of level bosses you can either blast in the top right hand corner of the cave to get three hidden hostages OR blast the far bottom left hand corner for three hidden hostages. It is not possible to get both of these groups. You can only get one or the other. 

MISSION 5 (hostages: 13):

Blast the first and second houses and two hostages will appear. 

Fire at the top of the first and second trees in the stage in between the shops and houses. The first tree yields three POW's and the second only two.

Blast the undercarriage of the end of level boss after it has lifted up on stilts to get three extra prisoners who also provide useful power ups. 

MISSION 6 (hostages: 25): 

At the beginning, shoot above you to find one prisoner. 

Destroy the big pack of rocks to deliver one POW. 

Blast the small white cloud above you just after the boat you are on has run ashore to get two hidden hostages. 

When you're out of the boat, go left in the water to find some points. 

POWs appear on screen during the fight with the final boss, if you shoot in the top right corner. 

* Beat the game in two players mode to view a different ending sequence.

Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001/II (c) 1998 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

The heroes of Metal Slug, Marco and Tarma, are called into action once again to take on the might of General Morden and his armies in this, the first of several sequels to the superb 1996 original. This time, however, Morden has acquired a number of powerful allies to aid him in his evil schemes, some of which are not even human. The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded 'Sparrow Squad', Fio and Eri.

Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor. The occasional moments of slowdown that blighted the first game are still present, however.

- TRIVIA -

Metal Slug 2 was shown at the 1998 AOU Amusement Expo show, in Japan. Then it was released in February 1998.

The game's alien enemies, together with the final battle and ending sequence, are a deliberate pastiche of the risible sci-fi blockbuster movie, 'Independence Day'.

On the parental advisory screen (US version), 'advisory' is misspelled as 'advisoly'.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Metal Slug 2 Original Sound Tracks - PCCB-00311) on 17/04/1998.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Rescued hostages are the greatest contributors of points. But you have to stay alive to get credit for your rescues (Once you complete a mission, you receive 10'000 pts for every POW).

MISSION 1, Deserts of Arabia: You are sent to control a loyalist force suspected of building weapons of mass destruction.
* The tallest tree after the 1st building contains lots of fruit and 3 hidden POW's.
* Palace: Shoot towards the right of the red banner to release 2nd lieutenant Hyakutaro Ichimonji. This mystic POW has an energy bolt which is powerful and homes in on anything you can shoot (this means structures as well; collateral damage). He'll help you until you finish the mission or die.
* You'll find the Camel Slug after the conversing Arabs. It comes equipped with a Vulcan but provides no cover against enemy fire. Like the Metal Slug, the Camel can run over enemy soldiers.
* BOSS 1, Harrier VTOL: Waves of swordsmen rush at you. Take them out before they get too close. After about 100 shots, 2 bazooka grunts open fire. Stay in between the jet exhausts. Aim for the engines as much as possible (You'll see and get 10,000 pt. for the 1st wing and 50,000 for the 2nd).

MISSION 2, Valley of the Pharaohs: Intelligence has indicated that the enemy army is using a secret Egyptian site to house military machinery.
* Use your gun to knock out an eye from the Sphinx (30,000 pts).
* Without hitting the explosive barrel, kill the Imperial Guards. Then, fire at the top right corner offscreen, for 3 POW's.
* If you stand next to the 1st and 3rd miners, they'll dig up some bonus items.
* Shoot at the top right of the support tower for a POW.
* Pyramid slope: A gem or 3 POW's are hidden at the top of the screen, right above the spot where the 1st mummy pops up.
* If you get a whiff of undead breath, you'll become a member of the undead, identifiable only by headgear. You'll be carrying only a pistol. Jumping is also quite a task. The flashing healing potions will turn you back into a human instantly.
* Near the door, get the POW's before clearing out the mummies.
* You'll catch up with Rumi Aikawa here. Shoot her for a healing potion or points.
* The eye hieroglyph before the special mummy hides a gem.
* Shoot the deceased explorer to make her give up a gem. Disgruntled, she'll give you the matching stick of dynamite.
* Jogging to the left, you'll see a few platforms to jump on. From the 2nd to the top, you can carefully jump over to the right. The long one holds 2 treasure chests. But don't stop here. Carefully jump on top of the cat statues. Shoot the chest open, which holds a magic lamp. If you are patient enough, a djinni will appear. Wait just a moment longer, and he'll grant a wish for riches. Starting from the moment the lamp is released, count the plumes of smoke and jump after the 5th one. Shoot above the right statue for another magic lamp.
* On the next level path (8th platform), the head of the hieroglyph holds gems. Shoot'em out!!
* If you let the mummy attack the explorer, you can destroy the new mummy for a gem.
* The twin-armed Slugnoid vehicle is located on one of the higher ledges of the tower of doom. The main cannon (C) fires downwards ((A)+(B) Swan Dive)
* BOSS 2, Iron Claw: Use your cannon and bombs. If you stay at the same altitude for a while, Iron Claw rears back and charges towards you. It won't fire while doing so, giving you time to get free hits in. When Iron Claw primes up, jump to the side ledges.

* BOSS 2 Freeze bug - Stop the nasty climbing! This original flaw give players an unfair advantage to eliminate Boss2 without any difficulty. Below is the following of how to activate. When the player standing on the platform which placed on the last chest, jump to the right edge of the next platform and fall to right lower platform immediately. The screen scrolls up and the boss emerges from the bottom of the screen. Instead of being killed as usual, the player is still there safe and sound ,while the boss freezes and do no climbing at all. At this moment, Just stay on the platform where you are and attack then it will be destroyed afterwards. The trick is also possible when riding the slugnoid or two players' game, but both player must do it at the same time.

MISSION 3, Supply Train: You've managed to catch up with an enemy train headed for a night shipment to the Far East.
* At the engine of the train, rescue the POW. Shoot at the smokestack from below to release 3 POW's.
* From the head of the engine, manage to clear more space with your jump to the next train for 50,000 pt.
* Use the Slug flyer which is equipped with a Vulcan that is limited in angular range.
* BOSS 3, Four Legger: While the boss is standing, jump to shoot at it. Everything except the flame-thrower can be avoided by hiding underneath its legs. If you still have the Slug flyer, stay on the left.

MISSION 4, Chinese City, Downtown: A platoon of enemy troops is stationed nearby. 
* Collect as much of the food as you can. Once you're fat, your weapons will cause more damage but you'll be slower.
* Most of the buildings can be demolished, revealing hidden POW's or bonuses. Some of the POW's can be reached by knocking down the building they're on or the one next to it.
* Right about where the monkey and fish are, jump into an opening in the walkway and find POW's and a diet shake.
* Sitting on a rooftop of the residential area is your Metal Slug.
* BOSS 4, Big Tank (kind of battleship): Only the cannons take damage during this battle. If using the Metal Slug, try for the lower cannons first. Use the houses and boulders to aim for the higher guns.

MISSION 5, New York: The townsfolk have been complaining about strange smells and sounds coming from the sewers. Intelligence confirms that a battalion is stationed inside, ready for an invasion. 
* Jump on top of any of the cars, firing downwards. The car will burst in flames, sending you into the sky to reach a lot of bonus items.
* At the end of the street, shoot at the fire escape of the last building for 3 POW's and into the tree for fruits.
* At the underground railroad, shoot into the top of the arch for POW's.
* As soon as one of the 4 trains approaches from the right, fire immediately.
After destroying each one, run to the right to regain any lost ground.
* After marker zero (0), the track bends from here. But before you shoot at the EXIT door, fire at the ceiling. There are 3 separate spots with hostages.
* In the sewers, you see a box with an arrow on it. Find the lever and press (A) to wind it. After 3 turns, an item will drop down with a weapon or bonus.
* BOSS 5, Nuclear Submarine: Surfacing from the sewer slime, the sub attacks with a lot of lightning balls and a thunder cannon. When you see double barrels pop up, prepare for some serious thunder. Fire the Vulcan and bomb it at the same time. 

MISSION 6, Siberian Shipyard: Far from Moscow, the rebel army has secretly established war factories and rebel headquarters.
* Mountainside: the sign with the arrow hides a POW.
* Midboss, Super Soldier: Fully recovered from his wounds of Metal Slug 1, he challenges you to another showdown. The horizontal shots can be ducked. Sometimes, you can knife him once and jump away. Take whatever shots you can in the meanwhile.
* In the submarine factory, after busting the tank, use the platform to release the hostage on the higher platform.
* Small platforms give you access to some of the prisoners on the top level, but it's easier to fight aliens on the lower platform.
* When the 2nd area is clear, turn the crank to release a Laser Rifle.
* 3 POW's are hanging at the top of the screen after the 3rd area.
* A POW is hidden on the short plank in the 4th area.
* BOSS 6, Battle Drone: Use the platform to the left whenever possible. When the rod is exposed, it will prime up for 2 seconds, then fire a bolt. Keep a constant fire when free from the Battle Pods. 
* FINAL BOSS, Mothership: Fear not the various grunts and tanks, they are here to help you. Try using them for cover. Aiming upward from anywhere will hit some section of the ship. The soldiers bring in a Metal Slug later in the battle, just unload it from the truck. After a long and ruthless battle, the Mothership withdraws.

Metal Slug 3 (c) 2000 SNK.

The heroes of the first 2 games return once more to do battle with the ever-present General Morden and his vast army. The third game of the series places a greater emphasis on defeating hulking boss characters than the 2 previous outings. Metal Slug 3 also introduced multiple routes through most levels, vastly increasing the replay value of the game. For example; on the first level the player reaches a point where they can either continue over land, or enter a small submarine and head down into the ocean depths, where they will be faced with a variety of huge, deadly sea-dwelling creatures.

Metal Slug 3 introduced a number of new elements that have a direct effect on the player's character - similar to the 'mummification' of the second game. The first of these is the 'fatty' affect: should the player pick up too much food (fish, for example) their character will morph in an obese version of itself. This doesn't have any detrimental effect on performance and is included purely for reasons of humour. Another effect is the now infamous 'Zombiefication'; should the player's character be attacked by a Zombie, he or she will become Zombie until they are either killed, or pick up a first-aid, which will restore the player's character back to human form. Movement while in the zombie state is slow and restricted but the player is armed with what can perhaps be best described as the 'Zombie Vomit'; a huge arc of blood that can be used to destroy oncoming enemies. A second Zombie attack while the player's character is in a Zombie state will result in the player losing a life.

Metal Slug 3 was released in May 2000. This game was the last game in the Metal Slug series developed by SNK. The underwater stages are a graphical nod to Irem's 1993 classic, "In the Hunt". This is understandable as many of SNK's Metal Slug developers originally worked for Irem.

Metal Slug 3 features a number of sci-fi movie homages: Mission 2 features a guest appearance by the Men in Black. The carnivorous plant aliens in Mission 4 are a parody of the sci-fi musical comedy, 'The Little Shop of Horrors'. The squid-like aliens in the gigantic Mission 5 (known as 'Mars People') are a homage to the movie, 'Independence Day'. Also, the alien clones you face in this stage seem to parody the sci-fi movie clasic, 'Invasion of the body snatchers'. Finally, the last boss battle seems to be slightly inspired by the ending sequence in the sci-fi horror movie, 'Alien Resurrection'. One of the hostages (who also appeared in "Metal Slug 2" &amp; "Metal Slug X", by the way) known as Hyakkutaro will join the fight by shooting fireballs.

Noise Factory released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Metal Slug 3 Original Soundtrack - NF-0002) on 31/01/2003.

A hack of this game was released in 2005 as "Metal Slug 6 [Hack]", one year before the official "Metal Slug 6".

The popular series of side-scrolling action games continues, introducing all-new characters into the plot. The world is now trembling under the fear of cyber terror, as the birth of a deadly new computer virus threatens to snatch the main military system out of every country.

They are: Marco Rossi, an army platoon leader; Fio Germi, a superior director of an Italian secret service; Nadia Cassel, a French regular army soldier; and Trevor Spacey, a regular army sergeant. In the game introduction, the team discover that Morden is still alive and probably behind Amadeus...

Meanwhile, Eri and Fio, investigating the Ptolemaic Army, a paramilitary syndicate active in archeological excavation, catch up with them at an ancient ruin, 'The Corridor of Fire'. The two try to storm and seize the site but are repulsed by the natives and giant Metal Slugs. This incident proves it was the Ptolemaic Army that stole the Metal Slug secrets.

		<name>Ms. Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Ms. Pac-Man (c) 1982 Midway. 

In this, the first proper sequel to Namco's legendary pill eating maze game, players must once again run around a number of mazes, eating all of the pills that are scattered throughout. The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) return to hamper the player's progress. The infamous 'Power Pills' are also present and correct, with four appearing in each maze. 

Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game's lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick. 

Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes. 

Ms Pac-Man features four different maze layouts, which alternate every two to four rounds: 

The first maze is only encountered in Rounds 1 and 2, and has 220 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze equidistant from the center of the maze. You must clear this maze two times before moving on to the next maze. 

The second maze is only encountered in Rounds 3, 4, and 5, and has 240 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze; one set in the lower half, and the other set at the very top. You must clear this maze three times before moving on to the next maze. 

The third maze is first encountered in Round 6 and has 238 dots and 4 Power Pills. Unlike all other mazes, there is only one set of tunnels in this maze, slightly above the center of the board. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. 

The fourth and final unique maze is first encountered in Round 10 and has 234 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze, directly next to one another in the middle of the maze. The turns at the entrance to the tunnels change the usual immediate accessibility of the tunnels and should be taken in to account. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. 

After Round 13, the game alternates every four rounds between the third and fourth mazes. 

Finally, the ghosts' movement patterns are also completely different from those of the original game. 

As in the original game, intermission scenes will be played after certain rounds. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions tell the story of how Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man met, fell in love, and had a baby. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions are also preceded by a sign and a title. 3 intermissions are present: 

1) Act I - They Meet: Pac-Man, the star of the original game, enters the screen being chased by Inky while Ms. Pac-Man enters from the other side being chased by Pinky. As the two of them are about to collide, they quickly move upwards, causing Inky and Pinky to collide. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man face each other at the top of the screen, and a heart appears above them. This intermission is played after Round 2. 

2) Act II - The Chase: Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are seen giving each other a playful chase. One chases the other in one direction, and they take turns alternating who chases who and in what direction. After three turns, they chase each other twice more at a faster speed. This intermission is played after Round 5. 

3) Act III - Junior: Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man anxiously await the arrival of a stork, who flies overhead with a bundle. As the stork is about to pass over them, he releases the bundle, which drops to the ground in front of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and opens up to reveal a baby Pac. This intermission, which is played after Rounds 9, 13, and 17, would later serve as the introductory sequence to "Jr. Pac-Man". 

No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.

[Upright model] 
[No. 595] 

The upright model came in the standard Namco/Midway cabinet. This is the same 'swoopy' cabinet that "Galaxian", "Galaga", and "Pac-Man" came in as well. These featured painted side-art of Ms. Pac-Man and the ghosts, along with some pink accent lines. The last 10, 000 or so Ms. Pac-Man machines to roll off the assembly line had sticker side-art instead, it was the same basic scene, but the colors were brighter, and there were a few minor differences in the layout of the graphics. The marquee showed an image of Ms. Pac-Man lounging on her own logo, with a ghost off to the side. The exact colors used on the marquee varied a bit over the production run (as did the paint codes used on the side). The control panel and monitor bezel had a single design that covered both of them, that of a blue background with a pink or maroon stripe going around it, with a few game instructions printed upon them.

- TRIVIA -

Ms. Pac-Man was released on January 13, 1982 in the USA, even if the copyright year is 1981.

Having won their enhancement kit lawsuit against Atari, General Computing went to Bally Midway and showed them an enhancement kit that they were working on for Pac-Man called Crazy Otto. Crazy Otto was a character similar to Pac-Man with the exception that he had legs. GCC was going to bluff Midway into letting them release their enhancement kit by telling them that they won their lawsuit against Atari, and that they just wanted Midway's blessing. Midway suggested that they create a sequel to the original Pac-Man instead of an enhancement kit, and GCC got to work on Ms. Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man had two prior names before settling on the one that everyone knows. 'Mrs. Pac-Man' was the original, but some of the women employees at Midway had a problem with that, so it was changed to 'Miss Pac-Man'. When someone pointed out the third intermission, where Pac and Ms. Pac welcome "Jr. Pac-Man" (or Baby Pac-Man) into the fold, they changed it to the final name of 'Ms. Pac-Man'. Midway released "Baby Pac-Man" as a pinball/video hybrid, and General Computing sued the company, claiming they had created the concept of a Pac Family. They won the suit and were awarded royalties from Pac Family merchandise. 

The logo for General Computer Corporation is present among the graphics, probably a leftover from the game's days as Crazy Otto.

In its initial run, 110,000 units were produced in the U.S. making it the best selling domestic arcade video game of all time. 

The game added a few improvements over the original: 
* Non-deterministic artificial intelligence for the ghosts, making it harder for enthusiasts to follow set patterns through levels. 
* A variety of different mazes used through the game. 
* Bonus items (such as cherries and pretzels) entered the maze and bounced through it, rather than appear in a set location as in the original, making the player go out of his way to attain it. 
* Brand new sound effects, including a new 'death' sound and opening theme. 

It was also one of the more successful of early arcade games in the female demographic, which has been attributed to 'Ms. Pac-Man' being a girl - although the Ms. Pac-Man sprite was little more than "Pac-Man" with eyelashes, a bow, lipstick and a dimple. 

After the 255th level, the maze (including dots) disappears. The game becomes unplayable, since there are no more dots to eat. 

Chris Ayra holds the record for this game on 'Regular' settings with 920,310 points on August 16, 1998. 

Victor Kunisada holds the record for this game on 'Speed-Up' settings with 922,810 points on June 16, 2001. 

Vancouver, Canada (Reuters) - Little 7-year old Al Nagac attained the Guinness World Record for Ms. Pac-Man v.2.97 with a score of 18,976,048. Al was exhausted and dehydrated and asked for several glasses of skim milk after shattering the longtime record of 11,056,736 set by Faith DeRivera, who was onhand to congratulate the victor with a kiss on the cheek. 

A Ms. Pac-Man unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Tightrope' (the cab appears in the background of the bar scene), in the 1990 movie 'The Grifters', in the 1999 movie 'Man In The Moon' and in the 2002 movie 'Van Wilder'. 

Milton Bradley (MB) released a board game based on this video game in 1983. Up to 4 players can play. The maze is divided into four colored areas, representing each player; the object of the game is to clear all the dots in your colored area. Only one player at a time controls Ms. Pac-Man; the other players control the ghosts. Once a ghost catches Ms. Pac-Man, the player controlling that ghost takes over control of Ms. Pac-Man. 

Michael Jackson used to own this game (Midway upright). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24th, 2009.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The most dangerous section of the first maze is the long path at the very top. It is safest to clear it when the ghosts are blue, or at least 3 of them occupy the bottom half of the maze. 

* There are a couple of dangerous sections in the second maze. The pathways above and below the T section at the top of the maze can be particularly easy to get trapped in. It is easiest to clear these when all 4 ghosts are close on your tail, or after eating one of the top two power pellets. The two sections directly above the lower escape tunnels on either side should also be cleared with caution. 

* The most dangerous section of the 3rd maze is the center of the bottom, directly below where you begin. It is advisable to clear it out as early as possible before the ghosts can organize and trap you. The top section of the maze presents the ghosts with many pathways to reach you, so use caution. 

* The most dangerous sections of the 4th maze is the section that you begin in, and the section directly above the ghosts' den. The very top section of the maze should also be cleared with caution. 

* Secret Message: the message 'GENERAL COMPUTER CORPORATION Hello, Nakamura!' is buried at the end of the Ms. Pac-Man ROM image (Masaya Nakamura was head of Namco). 

* There's a fairly well-known glitch in the game - if you put a coin in when the Ms. Pac-Man marquee title first appears but before Blinky appears then the first board will be blue instead of pink and will remain blue until you either finish the board or lose a life, after which the board will return to its normal color.

- TRIVIA -

Martial Champion was released in June 1993.

This game was former known as 'Yie Ar kung Fu 2', before it was released.

The character Jin is similar to the playable character of 'Ye Ar Kung Fu'.

The last boss, "Salamander", has the same name of the homonymous shoot'em up Konami

Martial Champion's sprites were some of the largest used in a fighting game up to that point (1993).

- UPDATES -

In all non-Japanese versions, Titi is known as Chaos and vice-versa.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Some of the selectable characters as Goldor, Avu, Titi (or Chaos in the Japanese version), Mahamba and Zen fighting with their weapons: if they fall to the ground during the fight (example, after a throw), they lose their weapon, and it can be collected by the opponent (by the way, few characters can use weapons to hit directly the opponent): the lost weapon can be even recovered by his owner.

Beat all the game without lose a round to see specials ending with the showcase of all the characters

- TRIVIA -

Most people probably already know that some of the characters' names were changed in the export versions (e.g., Rockman was changed to Megaman, etc.). 

When they recorded the announcer's voice, she had to say both the original names and the 'Export' ones during the recording. But for some of the characters' names that were NOT changed, there were alternate pronunciations recorded.
For example, when you select Chun-Li in the original Japanese version, the way the announcer pronounces 'Chun' rhymes with 'noon'. 
In the Export versions, the way she pronounces 'Chun' rhymes with 'fun'. There is also an unused alternate pronunciation of Zangief (which sounds like 'Zain-geef') that can be heard in the Sound Test. 

Megaman's 'Rock Upper' move in the original Japanese version is called 'Mega Upper' in the Export versions, simply because the name of the character is different in Japan and Worldwide.

NAM-1975 (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].

NAM-1975 is a war themed shoot-em-up set during the final months of the Vietnam war and offers one or simultaneous two-player gameplay. The story begins with the two soldiers called Silver and Brown entering the war to rescue Dr. R. Muckly, an ex-scientist of the US Army who has been kidnapped by the 'Northside Terrorists'. Dr. Muckly's daughter, Nancy, has also been kidnapped and is presumed imprisoned.

As the game progresses it's revealed that Dr. Muckly is a madman who is building a gigantic laser cannon with which to take over the world, players must fight through enemy-packed stages to reach and defeat the evil scientist. The game is an into-the-screen shoot-em-up with the action viewed from a third-person perspective. Players can move left and right, as well as run and somersault to avoid the incoming enemy fire. 

Players are initially armed with only a standard infinite-ammo machine gun and ten grenades. When certain enemies are killed, however, they drop more powerful guns or grenades that can be collected and used by the players. Weapons that can be picked up are:

* Balcan (A more powerful machine gun)
* Flamethrower (for taking out ground units only)
* Missile Launcher. 
* Grenades
* Spark Bomb
* Napalm Bomb.

Occasionally, an enemy soldier will appear holding a hostage. If players kill the soldier and save the hostage, the hostage joins the player and shoots at enemies until either the player is killed or reaches the end of the stage.

The final battle against Dr. Muckly does not allow continues and if players lose all of their lives during the battle, the game is over.

NAM-1975 was released on April 26 1990 in Japan.

This is the first game developed for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware

One of NAM-1975's influences was the 1987 Stanley Kubrick film, Full Metal Jacket. There are even some scenes which mirror the film such as the screaming soldier in the intro with the 'Born To Kill' helmet, and a Vietnamese lady with an AK-47 (which is seen near the end of the movie).

NAM-1975 was a blatant plagiarism of TAD Corp's "Cabal", released in September 1988.

- TRIVIA -

Ninja Combat was released in July 1990.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

By holding the A button until the attack gauge reaches full and then releasing it, you can unleash a burst of magical energy that can affect many of the enemies on screen. However, this has an effect similar to what happens in Final Fight: when you use this power, it decreases some of your life gauge.

By pressing the C button and then the A button, you can perform a special somersault attack that can be used to knock down a couple enemies in a row.

Only the main 2 players, Joe and Hayabusa, can pick up special weapons like swords, hachets and maces. The other 3 players (Musashi, Kagerow, and Gembu), who become selectable after appearing as sub-bosses, do not. To let go of a special weapon that you've picked up, press the B button.

Ninja Commando (c) 1992 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.

3 ninjas are sent on a mission to stop a madman named Spider from trying to use a time machine to mess with history. The game is almost like a tongue-in-cheek reworking of "Time Soldiers", which Alpha Denshi made 5 years earlier, with ninjas as the protagonists this time.

- TRIVIA -

Ninja Commando was released on April 30, 1992.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

The more you press the A button repeatedly, the more firepower you'll produce.

Press the A and B button together to fire shuri-ken (star-shaped blades). Unlike the main firepower, which is only straight ahead, the shuri-ken can be fired in all directions by moving the joystick in the opposite direction of which you wish to aim (example: to fire to the left, move the joystick to right and vice versa). This is also the best way to deal with a few of the bosses here: for example, on the stage set in feudal Japan, there are two giant sumo wrestlers who appear as sub-bosses. The main firepower seems to only have minor effect on them, but the shuri-ken are much more effective.

The C button is for firing magical bursts of energy. One drawback is that, similar to "Final Fight" this can cause a little of your life energy to be drained, so it should be used very carefully.

NeoGeo Cup '98 - The Road to the Victory (c) 1998 SNK.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.

- TRIVIA -

NeoGeo Cup '98 was released in May 1998. It was actually a hack of "Super Sidekicks 3" made by SNK themselves. His subtitle is a homage for "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory"

A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* View The Name List: At title screen hold A+B+C and press Start to begin.

* Each team has 0, 1, 2, or 3 strengths. It stands to reason that the best team will probably have 3 strengths, unless you like an  unusual combination like attack &amp; defense. Here are the 16 teams that have 3 strengths: Croatia, Nigeria, Italy, France, Holland, Brazil, Argentina, England, Germany, Spain, Denmark, Colombia, Mexico, Romania, Portugal, Yugoslavia

Neo Drift Out - New Technology (c) 1996 Visco.

Neo Drift Out - New Technology is a rally-themed racing game viewed from an overhead isometric perspective. Players choose to race in one of three Japanese rally-spec vehicles: the Mitsubishi Lancer, the Subaru Impreza and the Toyota Celica, with each car offering a different balance of Speed, Control and Body.

The game consists of a short practice stage, followed by up to six race stages, each set in its own location and offering different driving conditions. To progress to the next race, players must reach the current stage's finish line within a set time limit. Failure to cross the line in time results in game over. Each stage also featues a mid-way checkpoint that must be reached within a set time.

During a race, on-screen arrows advise players of upcoming corners and bends, and prompts warn them of hazards, these can include patches of ice, rocks, barrels, cones and ramps. Rival drivers also pose a hazard as they can ram into the player's car, causing it to spin out. Many stages include short-cuts and the six racing stages and their driving surfaces are:

Stage 1: European - Urban street stage
Stage 2: African - Savanna stage set in the African wilderness
Stage 3: Snow Land - Asphalt stage with patches of snow
Stage 4: Southern Hemisphere - Rocky cliff-based island stage
Stage 5: Scandinavian - Snow and ice-covered stage
Stage 6: Great Britain - Verdant forest stage

		<name>Ninja Master's - Haoh-ninpo-cho</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 26 years ago:

Ninja Master''s ～覇王忍法帖～ (c) 1996 SNK
(Ninja Master's Haoh Ninpou Chou)

Criminally overlooked and combo-friendly medieval Japanese fighter with great animation. Ten selectable characters and two end bosses.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: 217

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 4
=&gt; [A] Light Punch, [B] Strong Punch, [C] Light Kick, [D] Strong Kick

- TRIVIA -

Ninja Master's Haoh Ninpou Chou was released in May 1996.

The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Supreme Ninja Arts Scroll'.

The main design, as well as some of the special moves of the character 'Karasu' seem to be quite inspired by the main character of the 1994 movie hit 'The Crow' which was in turn, based on the graphical novel of the same name by James O. Barr (Even the name 'Karasu' stands as the Japanese word for "crow"!).:)

The character 'Nobunaga' is based on the real Japanese warrior 'Nobunaga Oda' who, during Japan's medieval period, overthrew the Ashikaga shogunate and ended a long period of internal strife by uniting half of Japan's provinces under his rule. In doing so he paved the way for the reunification of the country under the Tokugawa shogunate in the following century. His merciless use of power as well as his skill as a military strategist made him one of the most powerful &amp; feared leaders in Japan. The image of him in the game as a warrior who wields the demons power may have been some sort of a criticism to his eager embrace of Western culture, religion &amp; technology.

The character 'Goemon' is based on Ishikawa Goemon, the most famous thief in Japan on the Edo era (about 400 years ago) known to steal large sums of money from bad people and give the money to the poor. In other words, he was Japan's very own version of Robin Hood!

The character 'Sasuke' seems inspired on Sarutobi Sasuke, a famous legendary ninja with a strong sense of justice created in Tachikawa literature at the end of the Meiji period. Another source of inspiration may have been 'Ninja Kamui' an old anime series whose main character Kamui was an incredibly skilled ninja who wanted to abandon his ways as a killer thus becoming a 'nukenin' (runaway ninja) and marked for death by his own clan that vows to pursue and eliminate him.

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 22 years ago:

Nightmare in the Dark (c) 2000 Eleven / Gavaking.

A peaceful (yet creepy looking!) gravekeeper embarks on a night-shift battle against zombies &amp; other night dwellers in order to put an end to the grave robbing mystery before the local villagers panic! Features very nice graphics with cool backgrounds, great soundtrack &amp; pretty fun gameplay in the same style as "Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom", "Tumble Pop" &amp; "Zupapa!". The deceased must rest in peace, so be sure to remind them of this fact!:)

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: 0260

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 3
=&gt; [A] Attack/Throw fireball, [B] Jump, [C] Attack/Throw fireball

- TRIVIA -

Released in January 2000.

This game runs on the Neo-Geo MVS but was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'KING'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Alternate Costumes: At the beginning of the game (work at the continue screen too), hold the folowing buttons and press Start to choose an alternate costume: A = Blue, B = Red, C = Green, D = Yellow, AB = Grey, CD = Purple, AC = Orange, BD = Black.

* Shoot the treasure chests with fire and they will churn out lots and lots of diamonds until they disappear. As long as you do not get hit, the diamonds will continue to go up in value until they finally reach 10,000 each. Grabbing the sacks will add multipliers (2X, 4X, up to 8X) that will further increase your score.

* There are many cracks in the wood/stone of most levels. Some of these will reveal a fireball that will make your shot fly all over the board. Experiment with throwing at different angles to find these hidden spots. Most will clear the entire board as the ball flings out of control.

		<name>Out Run</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 36 years ago:

Out Run (c) 1986 Sega Enterprises, Limited.

Out Run is a ground-breaking racing game in which the player drives a red Ferrari Testarossa through a number of colourful European locations, trying to reach each end-of-level checkpoint before the tight time limit expires.

Each of the game's stages is packed with civilian traffic that must be carefully avoided, as players try to negotiate the game's twisting, hilly roads. 

At the end of every stage players are presented with a fork in the road, allowing them to chose which route they wish to take next. This was not the first time this feature had appeared (Tatsumi's 1983 racer, TX-1, was the first to introduce forked roads).

As well as being able to choose routes, players could also - via the game's "in-car radio" - choose one of three different catchy tunes to listen to while driving. The songs are 'Magical Sound Shower', 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'.

- TECHNICAL -

[1] Standard Type
[2] Upright Type

- TRIVIA -

Released internationally on September 20, 1986.

Also released as:
"Out Run [Deluxe Type]".

At the end of each stage, before the end-of-stage goal is reached, players are presented with a fork in the road; a unique innovation that, for the first time in the history of racing games, gave players a choice of which route they wished to take through the game. Out Run's game-play was both tight and instinctive and, together with the superb stage design and wonderfully realized sprite-scaled graphics, would completely revolutionize not just racing games, but arcade games in general.

Out Run is still regarded as perhaps the finest arcade racer (and certainly the finest sprite-driven racer) of all time. This was especially true of the deluxe cabinet version, which featured a fully hydraulic tilting cabinet (resembling a red Ferrari Testarossa) and a powerful speaker system situated directly behind the player's head. The sublime music still captivates many fans today, although the sublime 'Magical Sound Shower' is generally regarded as the finest of the three in-game tunes on offer (the others being 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'). The final tune, 'Last Wave', is only played when the high-score table is displayed.

At least part of Out Run's huge success was down to it capturing the fun-yet-superficial spirit of the 1980s. Previous racing games had concentrated on the more serious side of racing, with the action usually taking place in a Formula One racing car, over a series of competent but uninspiring racing tracks. Out Run was different; in a decade that celebrated style over content, the game offered players the ultimate boy racer experience by putting them behind the wheel of that eighties icon of cool, a red Ferrari Testarossa; replete with a 'blonde bimbo' in the passenger seat.

Sega didn't actually have (nor indeed ask for) permission from Ferrari to use one of their cars for the game. This inevitably led to a degree of bad feeling and threats of litigation between the two companies. They have since settled their differences, however, as Sega acquired an official license to use the Ferrari range in its 2003 sequel, "Out Run 2".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Fastest route: the fastest route for finishing the game is Right (Devil's Canyon), Left (Snowy Alps), Right (Wheatfield), Right (Autobahn).

* Secret credit message: right before the road forks, press and hold Start. When you choose one of the roads and the other one disappears from view, a secret credit message will come up on the screen.

* Instead of just pressing the accelerator all the way when you're about to start, you should instead try to keep the gas in 'the high greens' and just below red. The exact moment the green light goes on you should give it as much gas as possible thereby starting up much faster. Instead of shifting at approx. 170mph you should change gears at about 120 mph to avoid slowdown. This hint earns you approx. 1 second. This trick works every time you have to start from 0 mph but is difficult to time right when you don't have the green light for timing.

* The second before going off road you can change very quickly to low gear and then high gear again. If done correctly you can drive off the road without any slowdown for about 1-2 seconds. If you time it right you can actually change to low then high again after the 1-2 seconds and not loose ANY speed whatsoever when driving offroad. This way you can keep going 292mph even though you're offroad.

Pac-Land (c) 1984 Namco.

Pac-Land is a horizontally-scrolling platform game set in the cartoon world of the game's title. A fairy has lost her way and needs Pac-Man to help her get back to her home of Fairyland. Pac-Man, with the fairy safely hidden beneath his hat, must run and jump through the colourful world until he reaches and enters the magical door to Fairyland. Upon being rescued, the fairy gives Pac-Man a pair of magical shoes for his trip back home. These enable him to jump wherever he wants, without the need for a platform to jump from. This effectively means Pac-Man can 'sky-jump' back home if he so wishes.

Directional buttons make Pac-Man walk left and right and it's possible to make him run by tapping the desired directional button twice. Pac-Man is pursued by his ever-present enemies in the form of five ghosts - Pinky, Inky, Blinky, Clyde and Sue. Pac-Man must avoid the ghosts and other deadly objects that populate the levels. As with previous games in the series, a small number of 'Powerpills' appear. Eating a Powerpill makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible and turns the ghosts purple and vulnerable to being eaten. On some stages, Pac-Man must use a springboard to jump over large ponds by leaping from the springboard and rapidly moving left and right while in the air.

The game's stages are called 'trips', with players able to start on any one of the first five. Each trip made up of four rounds (three rounds to reach Fairyland and one round to return home) with a short interval between each one. The objective in all trips is to get the fairy safely back to Fairyland then return home to Pac-Man's family. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right, avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. The journey home, however, scrolls right to left.

Each stage must be completed within a set time limit and if the player runs out of time before finishing a round, Sue (the purple ghost) will speed up considerably and kill Pac-Man. At the end of each round, players are awarded bonus points based on how much of the time limit remains. On each stage, cherries and other items can be collected for extra points. There are a total of 8 different trips in the game, totalling 32 levels. After the 8th trip, the 9th trip is a repeat of the 5th trip, with level 33 effectively being level 17, with an increased difficulty level.

- TRIVIA -

Pac-Land was released in August 1984 in Japan. The game took a little over a year to develop, which was pretty long for that time, but there was a break in the middle. The game was very successful.

This game was influenced by Hanna-Barbera's Pac-Man cartoon, which ran from 1982-84 in the USA. The character designs and music are taken directly from the show. The background music that plays during the levels is the same as the cartoon's theme song. 

The anime was not broadcast in Japan. So videos of the series were sent to the developers for inspiration. Namco developed a powerful hardware to have a visual close to the series and to be able to display elements in the foreground, which is also present in the series (trees that are displayed in front of Pac-Man, etc.).

It was Kishimoto's idea to allow the player to go back and fly. He programmed these elements without asking the planner first.

It was the planner who decided not to use a joystick, he thought it was easier / more fun to use buttons to vary the speed (Track'n Field may have had an influence on this).

Mark Mendes holds the official record for this game with 4,150,400 points.

- UPDATES -

The Midway version allows the player to start on any one of the game's first five 'trips', whereas the Japanese version starts only on the first stage. Also, the gameplay in the Japanese set is much slower than that of the Midway set, making for an easier game. 

The Japanese set also has some minor graphical differences to the Midway version. Pac-Man's nose is longer, and the hat he wears has a feather in it. Also, when Pac-Man completes a stage and returns home to his family, only Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man are waiting to greet him. Chomp-Chomp and Sour Puss, the pet dog and cat who appear in both the Midway sets and the cartoon on which the game is based, are both missing.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Round 1 - Jumping on the first three fire hydrants to generate five cherries is quite safe as you don't have any cars until after the third hydrant. Continuing, you can see another fire hydrant just after the Pac-Pill. Straight after getting this, you can push the fire hydrant backwards, getting a helmet. This enables you to collect the babies that the ghosts throw from their planes (you lose your hat if you run out of time or die).

Round 2 - The Forest: The first 'cheat' is achieved by pushing the second cactus back -  giving you 80,000 points and transporting you to your house at the end of level two. If this doesn't work, then try the second, third, and fourth logs in the woods. The machine randomly chooses one of these (pushing the logs only works if you haven't died and you have 15,000 points). Get the cherry that appears as it turns into another three.

Round 3 - The mountains: These have no cheats, but watch out for the plane that always flies over the first mountain. (A flower sometimes grows here and in many other places, I am sure that this means nothing.) After completing the mountains, you pass two cacti. Pushing the first one back, on earlier versions, makes you invisible and invincible to everything except the water (which just happens to be the next obstacle!) To jump over the water, run at full speed over the spring board, and at the edge, press jump and keep on whacking the joystick to the right - you should glide over the pool! You have then reached Fairyland! Here the Queen gives you a gift of magic boots that enable you to fly. You then start Round 4 going back the opposite way.

Round 4 - Journey home: You first encounter cacti that you must jump over. If at any point you see the letter 'S' in a Pac bubble flying about, get it - it's an extra life. There is also another letter in a Pac bubble that flies around the screen - the letter 'L' - this can be achieved after getting a Pac-Pill, getting four ghosts and then Doris fifth (Doris is the one that chases you and the only one that has no hat after eating a Pac-Pill). The last cactus that you jump over is very tall. Try pushing the lower section of it backwards as this generates seven balloons, six of which are worth 100 points but one is worth 7,650 points. Get this and don't bother with the others. Continue going home once you reach the town, jump on all fire hydrants as this always generates cherries. If pushing the cactus back didn't do anything, then try pushing the second to last fire hydrant back - this will generate the balloons. When you arrive home, you can still jump to get 7,650 points.

Round 5 - The Town: Jump on the fire hydrants to generate cherries. Push the third hydrant back to give you the hat. If you pass two fire hydrants on top of each other, then jump on top of these. The blue things that push you along (water jets) can also push you on top of the houses. This is advisable as it keeps you away from any double decker buses! If the second fire hydrant didn't give the helmet then the fourth fire hydrant along will.

Round 6 - The water pool area: You have two short(ish) pools to clear, followed by more ghosts on pogo sticks (here appears another floating cherry). The last pool is the longest of these and must be judged carefully to clear.

Round 7 - The water jets: You have three different platforms to jump on. Always try to stay on the highest one. If a flying water jet happens to hit you then whack the joystick everywhere and press fire as it is possible to escape. Not much on this round, just collect loads of strawberries. After this you reach fairyland again, you receive the boots again, and have to return home.

Round 8 - The trip home: Firstly, you have to cross the long pool - backwards. Jump to the top of the screen straight away to get the cherries and clear the planes. There are stumps sticking out that you can land on and get cherries. After this there is the forest to complete. The first or second to last log will give the balloons. 

Round 9 - The Water Pool Area: You leave your house and go straight into the water pool area. There are three cacti on this round. Pushing either the first (before the pool), second (before the skeleton) or third (before the Pac-pill) back will give you the helmet. The pool is slightly different as it has a stump sticking out of the water that has an extra spring board you can land on. After this there is a skeleton (that drags you down into the ground) and must be jumped over.

Round 10 - The forest: Pushing one of the logs back will make you invincible to the ghosts. This works even if you have died. When you start flashing, the invincibility is about to wear off.

Round 11 - The logs and clouds: Much like the one on Trip 1 except after jumping the logs, you have to jump onto clouds (although not essential as Pac can clear all the cloud jumps in one). After this you reach Fairyland yet again and you receive the boots.

Round 12 - The trip home: First collect the three cherries. Then you have to jump backwards over a large pool - with no stumps. After this you reach the town. One of the few fire hydrants gives the balloons.

Round 13 - The Town: This level has many double hydrants. Jump on these and wait for the water jet to push you up onto the houses. Walking along the houses gives you some cherries. On many versions there is no helmet on this round.

Round 14 - The cavern: You have to collect the keys to open the doors. The first key is on the top layer. Jump up there to get it. Keep going right and fall down the hole. Keep going right and fall down the next one, too (you should now be on the bottom layer). Keep going right (staying on this level) and open the door. Keep going right. Jump up through the next hole and get the apples. Continue right, fall down the hole and get the key. Use this immediately to open the door. Keep going right, do not jump through the first hole and stay on the lowest level. You can then get two apples, jump through the hole and get a key, and then fall through another hole to get another two apples. Continue right and after opening the door, jump through the holes to get from the bottom level to the top. Open the door you reach and go through. Fall through the next two holes (so that you are back on the lowest level). Open the door you reach and get the two apples. Return through the door you've just come through, jump to the middle layer and continue right. You will now be out of the cavern and have reached 'break time'. So long as you don't waste time and keys it is actually easy.

Round 15 - The water jets: I think that pushing one of these fire hydrants may give the helmet, but I'm not too sure. Watch out for the planes at the very end of the level. Try to jump on them.

Round 16 - The trip home: The first gives the balloons. Next it's the mountains. There is normally an extra life lurking around the second mountain so go backwards once for it if it doesn't come (an 'S' in a Pac). Then it's the forest. The first log encountered gives the balloons if the cactus didn't.

Round 17 - A forest level: On some versions of the machine the very first cactus will give the helmet. Just before the water is a Pac-Pill and it is quite easy to get the time bonus. After the pool, there is a short forest, following that is a spring board that must be used to clear a second pool that cannot be seen from that point.

Round 18 - The cavern: You only have limited sight. The first key is on the lower level. Go right, then jump up to the middle level, then jump up to the top layer. Keep going right and fall down a hole to the middle layer (you'll be in between two doors). Jump back up to the top level (making sure you don't open either of these). Once back on the top level, keep going right and you'll reach a door. Open it and get the key directly behind. Keep going right, fall down to the middle layer, get the key, fall down to the lower level, and collect the fruit. Open the door you come across. Don't jump through the next hole, but through the one after that. Jump to get the key (fall straight back down again). Keep going right. Jump up through the next hole, go right, and fall down the next. Open the next door (you're still on the bottom level) and jump through the next hole. Then jump up to the top level, open the door and get the fruit. Go through on the top and open the end door. Fall through the holes and go to the bottom level. Go right and collect the fruit there. Finally, go to the middle level and exit to 'Break Time'.

Round 19 - The mountains: Clear these and the clouds as usual, but watch out for the planes at the end (over the part with three sets of moving logs). Enter Fairyland.

Round 20 - The return home: This is very easy. Keep on going left, You first hit a forest. Watch out for the ghost near the end. This is followed by a pool, get all the cherries on the way, but DON'T stop for anything. Then you reach another forest, then another pool, then the last forest (watch out for another ghost here) and then the town. By the time you reach the town you will be out of time and must run full speed from Doris. Try to get the Pac-Pill but if you miss it, don't go back for it!

Round 21 - The town: This is hard as there are so many ghosts. It is pointless jumping onto the double hydrants as getting on top of the houses may involve hitting a plane. Try to stay on the top of the double-decker buses, jumping from one to another. This will stop you needing a run up. The Pac-Pill at the end can only be got by first jumping onto a ghost. Don't bother with it unless you are already on a ghost. Go straight for 'Break Time'.

Round 22 - The mountains: As well as the clouds, you meet a new section - four logs in water that must be jumped onto and crossed. Careful judgment is needed here. Get the Pac-Pill afterward as you'll need it. Time is short so don't stop for anything.

Round 23 - The water jets: This gets hard towards the end as there are many ghosts around. Try to stay on the planes. You then reach Fairyland.

Round 24 - The trip home: First are the water jets to cross. This is quite easy as there aren't many ghosts and enables you to collect a lot of fruit. Then you enter the town. The last part of this is very hard. Just jump for the Pac-Pill when you see it and hope you get it before you are killed! Don't wait around.

Round 25 - The woods: There are two woods split up by lots of skeletons. DON'T use the spring board or you will hit one of the planes. All of the skeletons are fake apart from the first and last. So don't worry about touching them. When you enter the first wood, look for the helmet at the fourth log. I think it is hidden in there.

Round 26 - The mountains - again!: This time you don't have many logs to jump on and there are very few clouds. Most of the mountains have to be jumped without any clouds. This level also contains the logs in water and is the furthest that I've ever got.

* The appearance of special items in Pac-Land is NOT random. The position in which they appear depends on the last two digits of the player's score when starting a round. The table below gives the position of the obstacle which needs to be pushed to reveal the secret. In the table, R stands for Round No., F for feature (H=Helmet, W=Warp, T=Transparency, B=Balloons). The relevant obstacle number is given in each column for each score. For example, when first starting a game, the last two digits will obviously be 00, so the helmet appears by pushing the 4th hydrant. If, on the second round, the player starts with e.g. 20,020 points, then the warp will be hidden in the 2nd tree stump and so on. Some rounds have no hidden items. Now, when running from left to right, the obstacles are counted as the player meets them, BUT for return journeys (right-&gt;left), the numbering is different, only the LAST four obstacles are relevant. For example, on Round 4, Obstacle 1 is the last large cactus the player meets, Obstacles 2, 3, and 4 are the three hydrants in the town (numbered from right to left). All obstacles must be pushed in the opposite direction that Pac-Man must run in to reach his goal.

*There is only one obstacle on Rounds 11 and 12.

The helmet gives protection from falling monsters, and gives points for every one collected. The warp only appears on Round 2, and warps the player to Trip 3 and awards 70,000 points. Transparency makes Pac-Man invulnerable to ghosts, and balloons give points. Six balloons are released, and usually five of them are worth 100 points, and another 7,650 points, BUT if the last four digits of the player's score are 0000, then ALL 6 balloons will be worth 7,650 points.

There are no hidden items on any Round on Trip 8, and Trip 9 is the same as Trip 5, Trip 10 the same as Trip 6 and so on, repeatedly (can anyone confirm?).

Puzzle Bobble (c) 1994 Taito Corp.

Puzzle Bobble is an arcade puzzle game offering either one or two-player competitive play, in which the aim is to clear each play area of the coloured bubbles clustered in the upper half of the screen. 

This is achieved by firing bubbles up the screen - with the angle of trajectory dictated by the player - at the clusters of bubbles. The aim is to forms chains of like-coloured bubbles, making them disappear. At regular intervals the 'ceiling' of the play area - together with any bubbles stuck to it - will drop one row down the screen, decreasing the size of the play area making life more difficult for players. The game is over when the bubbles reach the very bottom of the play area.

In the single-player game there are thirty-two rounds to complete. In the two-player 'versus' mode, the winner is the player who clears their arena first. Both players have an identical arrangement of coloured bubbles in each arena and when a player removes a large group of bubbles (four or more), some of them are transferred to the opponent's arena.

Bubbles will fire automatically if the player remains idle. After clearing the arena, the next round begins with a new pattern of bubbles to clear.

- TRIVIA -

Puzzle Bobble was released in June 1994. it was the first in the hugely successful puzzle series from Taito.

The game was originally called Bubble Buster. The Bubble Buster title screen is buried in the game itself.

This game is known in US as "Bust-A-Move".

This game was re-released 6 months later (December 1994) on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware as "Puzzle Bobble [MVS]".

As well as typically cute Japanese animation (Bub and Bob from "Bubble Bobble" operate the cannon) and music, the game's mechanics and level design were beautifully balanced, and the game was terrifically successful at the arcades, spawning several sequels (see Series section for more information). It is unusual in being popular with women and girls.

If you look closely at the bubbles, you'll notice that the enemies from Bubble Bobble are trapped inside; a different enemy for each different colored bubble. The following chart shows which enemies are trapped in which color bubble:
Legend: Color of Bubble =&gt; Bubble Bobble Enemy Inside
Blue =&gt; Zen-Chan
Yellow =&gt; Pulpul
Red =&gt; Invader
Green =&gt; Drunk
Purple =&gt; Monsta
Orange =&gt; Banebou
Black =&gt; Hidegonsu
White =&gt; Mighta

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'AAA'.

During the credits you can see one of the constellations form the image of a fish, that fish is a boss from the "Darius" series; also made by Taito.

According to Twin Galaxies, the official electronic scoreboard, Kim Korpilahti holds the official records for this game with 16013660 points (difficulty 6) on November 6, 2004.

Zuntata Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Puzzle Bobble Variety - ZTTL-0009) on July 6, 2008.

One of the playable characters is an enemy character from "Real Puncher".

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'PB3'.

The player controls the sun god Apollo who is riding of his winged horse Pegasus flying through ancient Greece on a mission to rescue his sister Artemis the goddess of the moon, from the clutches of the fiend Typhon. Shoot all enemies like harpies and skeletons along with goblins and colossal enemy bosses.

Pressing the fire button makes his sword fire a tiny shot, while holding it down charges the sword, firing a bigger fireball upon release. Even the smallest enemies take multiple hits, so the standard shot is of little use.

		<name>Phoenix</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 42 years ago:

Phoenix (c) 1980 Amstar.

Phoenix is a classic vertical shoot-em-up in the mould of Taito's "Space Invaders" and Namco's "Galaxian", but takes the concept further with the introduction of progressive stages of play (instead of simply repeating a single playfield over and over with an increasing difficulty level). 

The player pilots a lone ship that can only move left and right along the botton of the playfield and fire upwards. The ship can also utilize a temporary 'Force Field' to protect it from missiles and birds. Any birds that that collide with the Force Field are destroyed. The Force Field only lasts for two seconds, but then cannot be used again for another five seconds. 

There are five attack waves to each round of play. 

The first wave begins with a formation of sixteen birds attacking the player's ship. They drop missiles and dive at the ship in an effort to destroy it. 

The second wave is a variation of the first, only with a different enemy attack pattern. 

The third wave begins with pattern of eight eggs that hatch into blue Phoenix birds that then attack the player's ship. These birds can be destroyed by rocket fire from the ship. If the rocket hits the bird on center, the bird is destroyed. If the rocket hits the bird to the left or right of center, only that wing of the bird is destroyed. The wing will regenerate itself if the bird is not quickly destroyed. 

The fourth wave is similar to the third, only with two banks of eggs instead of one. 

The fifth and final wave is the attack of the Space fortress mothership; a huge mothership piloted by a purple-coloured Alien Queen who sends down waves of small birds to attack the player's ship, as well as launching missiles from the mothership itself. The Alien Queen is protected by a barrier that must be shot several times before both the Queen and the mothership are destroyed.

Once the mothership has been destroyed, the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.

The additional gameplay elements seem to be at the expense of hardware performance. Despite having more basic graphics than "Galaxian", Phoenix's ships move in a very mechanical fashion compared to the smooth, nicely animated movements of Namco's classic.

Most Phoenix games will be in a standard Centuri woodgrain cabinet, but several other cabinets exist, due to this game being sold by multiple companies at the same time. These use sticker sideart (which covers the upper half of the machine), and glass marquees. The control panel is made up entirely of buttons, no joysticks are present (on the upright and 'maxi' cabs, that is; the cocktail cab has a 2-way joystick and 2 buttons). The monitor in this machine is mounted vertically, and the monitor bezel is relatively unadorned. Phoenix uses a unique wiring harness, which isn't know to be compatible with any other games.

Titlescreen's copyright notice:
PHOENIX COPYRIGHT 1980
AMSTAR ELECTRONICS CORP.
PHOENIX AZ. U.S.A.

Phoenix was released in December 1980.

Phoenix was the first multi-level space shooter and also the first shooter to include bosses. Despite its hardware issues, Phoenix's many gameplay innovations ensured that it now is rightly regarded as a classic and, along with Taito's "Space Invaders" and Namco's "Pac-Man" shares the dubious honour of being one of the most cloned games of the 1980s; with numerous console and home computer 'tributes' appearing.

The song that is played at the start of the game is 'Romance de Amor', also known as 'Spanish Romance', whose true author is currently unknown.

The song that is played when you start over after the mothership is destroyed is Ludwig van Beethoven's 'Für Elise'.

Mark Gotfraind holds the official record for this game with 987,620 points.

- SCORING -

Scoring is a little complicated in this game due to the fact it depends on hits made and how close the Phoenix's are to your fighter.

Phoenix fighters: 20, 40, or 80 points; 200 points if flying as a bird.
Phoenix birds: 50 or 100 points/egg, 100 - 800 points/bird (depends on how many wings shot off and distance from fighter).
Mothership: 1,000 - 9,000 points (may depend on how close the mothership is to you fighter when you kill the Alien Queen; may also depend on the amount of damage to the mothership, speed of destruction, as well as the number of spaceships destroyed). Usually, first 9 spaceships would increase by a thousand, then will be followed by nine 9000 point spaceships, then back to the first nine set, etc...

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle at the bottom of the screen. You will see a formation of enemy fighters at the top of the screen. This is the beginning of Wave 1. A quick note about the Force Field: it lasts a couple of seconds and takes about five seconds to regenerate again.

WAVES 1 AND 2:
1) You will usually be attacked by multiple fighters at any one time. The movements of these fighters is pretty random.
2) In addition to dropping bombs on your fighter, Phoenix fighters also tend to try to ram your fighter.
3) After you clear out a few fighters, they will reassemble at the top of the screen. They will then move in synch with each other as they creep to the bottom of the screen.
4) Sometimes a Phoenix fighter will hover right above your ship. If you're quick, you can get off a quick shot and move away before a bomb can be dropped on you.
5) If multiple Phoenix fighters are at your level, use the Force Field to clear a path through them.

WAVE 3 AND 4:
1) The Phoenixes in Wave 3 enter the screen in a zig-zag pattern while the Phoenixes in Wave 4 arrive in a cross-over pattern of four Phoenixes per side.
2) Once they get large, they start to do erratic zig-zag patterns across the screen. At the same time, they are dropping bombs toward your fighter. Your goal is to shoot off their wings. If you do this, it forces them to go straight down until the wing regenerates. They will still be dropping bombs, but at least they will be going straight down.
3) If at all possible, try to hit the Phoenixes when they are close to your ship. Doing this gets you more points.
4) In addition, try to shoot off both wings before destroying a Phoenix for more points.

WAVE 5:
1) Your goal on this wave is to cut through the mothership's hull and shield and take out the Alien Queen inside.
2) Start firing as rapidly as you can to quickly cut through the hull. It will take quite a few shots to get to the shield.
3) The shield rotates so you will have to hit it a lot of times in order to get a wide enough hole in it to hit the Alien Queen.
4) As all of this is going on, the mothership is continually descending upon your ship. In addition, the escorts are constantly harassing you.
5) A good strategy is that once you have cut a path through the hull and shield, wait for the mothership to be almost on top of your ship. When you take out the alien, you will get a lot more points.
6) Destroying the escorts does not end this wave. Once you complete Wave 5, the cycle begins anew.

* During the game three birds will attack all in a line. Let those birds fly all the way to the bottom and start to fly back up. As they are flying up, shoot all three in a row real quick (2 or 3 seconds) and you will elevate your score to 204,000 regardless of what your current score is - The best way to get this bonus for shooting the three birds in a line is on the second stage of level 2. The blue and pink birds in an oval shape. Just wait, not firing at the bottom of the screen. A single bird will come down, fanny around and then fly back up, then four birds will fly down together in a line. When they start to fly back up - blast three of them for the bonus. It works best here because of the rapid fire allowed on this and every other 2nd stage. In addition, accomplishing the trick a second time again puts your score at 204,000, even if your score was higher.

Pipi &amp; Bibis (c) 1991 Toaplan.

Pipi &amp; Bibis is a platform game for one or two players, in which the aim is to infiltrate buildings and plant time bombs at the computer terminals that litter the levels. The planting of the final bomb starts the detonation sequence, players must then quickly reach the level's exit before the bombs explode.

Each level is populated with enemy scientists and agents, and any contact with these will result in the loss of a life. To help combat this, players are armed with a 'stun gun' which will knock the enemy to the floor, allowing the player to pass. If an enemy is held in the stun gun's beam for several seconds, the enemy will fall to the platform below.

At the completion of each level, part of a cartoon picture of woman in a state of undress is shown. The entire picture is revealed once every four levels.

Licensed to Nova Apparate GMBH &amp; Co. for Europe.
Licensed to Romstar for USA.

This game is known in Japan as "Whoopee!!".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

As players have such little time to escape once the detonation sequence has started, the final bomb planted should always be the one closest to the exit.

If an enemy is held in the stun gun's beam on either the bottom level or in an elevator, the enemy will fall out of the level and be killed.

* Hidden Functions: If the 'Invulnerability dip switch' is enabled, you are invulnerable but you may also 'Pause' the game with P2 Start and restart with P1 Start.

- SCORING -

Shooting a yellow ship on stage 1: 80 points.
Shooting a blue ship on stage 1: 80 points.
Shooting a falling blue ship on stage 1: 100 - 800 points.
Shooting a bird dead center on stage 2:  100 points.
Shooting a bird's wing on stage 2: 20 points.
Docking the ship on stage 3: points awarded for remaining fuel.
Shooting the falling ships on stage 4: 100 points.
Destroying the mother-ship: 800 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* On stage 1, you can ignore as many yellow ships as possible, and only aim for the blue ones. When the yellow ones move off screen there is often a chance that the next wave will include a blue ship. Since the blue ships are worth more points they are worth waiting for.

* On stage 2 the birds do not fire until they are fully developed. You can usually take out 3 or 4 of them before they start firing.

* On stage 2 you can concentrate on continual fire on birds wings when there are only 2 or 3 remaining, as this awards 20 points per hit and does not destroy the bird. You can rack up a good score by doing this, but watch out for the falling bullets.

* The asteroids positioning on the docking stage is totally random, so this stage is often down to chance. Do not use your thrusters to maximize your bonus points.

* On stage 4, the ships which come down from the cloud move across you from left to right and back again. You can time your firing so that they are hit when directly above you. Note that only the mother-ship fires at you so you can take out the ships when not directly below the cloud, and be safe in the knowledge that you have no bullets to avoid.

Pochi to Nyaa (c) 2003 Aiky.

Pochi to Nyaa is a cutesy puzzle game where the objective is to match the colored invaders in chains much in the vein of the Sega game "Puyo Puyo Fever". Pochi to Nyaa features three different modes of play: story mode, vs. computer mode, and two player vs. mode.

Story mode is a bare bones, single player game with three difficulty settings. The player works to build up chains in order to gain more time to play in one endless level. Once the timer runs out the game is over.

Vs. Computer mode is more of a real story mode where the player takes on the role of the novice wizard Prim, who has foolishly been lured into the "Pochi and Nyaa Tournament" by the promises of pudding. Before each battle Prim engages her opponent in a brief dialogue in order to advance the storyline. The player advances to the next opponent after winning one round. If the player loses the round then it is game over.

Vs. Player mode is a standard two player battle mode and begins with a character select screen.  After the characters are selected there is a short dialogue to introduce the players' characters and then the battle begins. Whoever wins two round of gameplay is the victor. Unlike many other two player games, Pochi to Nyaa vs. mode is played on one credit and so once the winner is announced the game is over.

Released in December 2003.

The game is known outside Japan as "Pochi and Nyaa".

'Pochi' is a common name for a 'dog', and 'Nyaa' is the typical sound for a 'cat', so the title translates as 'Puppy and miaw'. The title is a pun: there is an extra char, so it can be read as 'Pochitto Nyaa', and Pochitto is the sound for a button quickly pressed.

This game was out first out on the Sega Naomi hardware in 2002, and was ported to the SNK Neo-Geo MVS at the end of 2003 (but was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console).

		<name>Pole Position</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Pole Position (c) 1982 Namco.

Pole Position is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. Game action takes place at the Fuji Speedway in Japan. The scenery around the speedway consists of green meadows, hills, and snow-capped Mt. Fuji. 

The player drives a Formula-1 race car on the track. The first objective of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the player beats the clock, he or she qualifies for the race. If not, he or she drives out the remainder of the time along the qualifying course. 

As a qualifier, the player is ranked according to his or her qualifying lap time, from the 1st (pole) position to the 8th. The second objective of the game is to race against the clock and other cars to finish the specified number of laps ('Nr. of Laps' dip switch setting; 3 laps is the default) of the race as fast as possible and to achieve the highest score possible. The player earns points for passing cars, driving on the track, and finishing the race with time remaining. He or she is rewarded with an extended-play lap for completing the first lap within a certain amount of time (depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting). 

The game starts with the player's car behind the starting line and a certain amount of time, in seconds ('Game Time' dip switch setting; the default is 90 seconds), will be on the clock. The player's car must finish the qualifying lap within a certain amount of time (which varies depending on the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting) to be in the race. If the player does not qualify, his or her car continues on the track until the 'Game Time' elapses.

If the player has qualified, just before the race begins, the player's car (flashing on the screen) is placed at the starting line with seven other cars. The position of the car depends on the position earned during the qualifying lap. (The player's car is always placed at the 8th position in the attract mode.)

The starting lights flash from red to green, and the race begins. Racing hazards are other racing cars, sharp turns, road signs, and water puddles. (All of these hazards except for water puddles are also present on the qualifying lap.) As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the player's car hits another car or a road sign, it is destroyed in an explosion. The player's car reappears in a few seconds and the race continues. Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the player's car. 

Racing into the first turn, the player must let up on the accelerator slightly to make the corner. Road signs flash along the side of the track. Depending on how well the player manipulates the controls, he or she can either roar through the hairpin turns like a champion or spin out in a flaming crash. He or she jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his or her eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When time runs out, the race is over. If the player has beaten the racing lap time and has seconds remaining, the remaining seconds are added to the extended lap time, which varies depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting. 

The top score achieved by a player appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appears last.

- TRIVIA -

Pole Position was released in September 1982 in Japan.

When Pole Position was introduced, players lined up in arcades around the world to grip the steering wheel and stomp on the gas pedal of a driving game so realistic that the players -- just like their cars -- were swerving around the corners. Pole Position was a 14-carat contribution to the golden age of video games. It started the trend for photo-realism in video game graphics. In addition to great graphics, it had great game play and was a huge success, dominating game charts for almost about two years. 

Pole Position was the first driving game to be based on a real circuit. The action takes place at Fuji Speedway in Japan. The snow-capped Mt. Fuji appears in the background.

* A place in video game history: "Pole Position stands out as the racing game that really appealed to the general public," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "It went into arcades across the nation, where it can still be found. Pole Position machines were placed everywhere -- even in gas stations!". The popularity of Pole Position was based on its realism. Players felt as if they were actually in the driver's seat. "Racing games before Pole Position tended to have a top-down perspective in which you floated over the course, which wasn't terribly realistic," Lindsey said. "Pole Position's eye-level point of view gave it a great deal of realism, and this point of view became a standard for racing games that followed. In addition, it provided a lot of peripheral cues. You saw lots of things zipping by on the side of the screen and this really added to the excitement of the game. Pole Position also had great sound. You could hear the gears winding out in the stretches. As you zipped by another car, you could hear that car's engine. All of these details added to the overall effect. Pole Position was, and still is, an awfully nice game."

 * The great 25-cent escape: Chris Lindsey believes that a big reason why Pole Position has remained such a timeless classic is that it has always appealed to women, in addition to men. "I think there are quite a few game developers who would like to figure out why some games appeal to females," Lindsey said. "Perhaps this is just pop psychology, but I've seen two types of games women will take to: racing games, and games in which the character, or your representation on screen, is doing something besides destroying bad guys. I don't know if that's the correct way to describe it, but that is what I've seen. I've had occasion to work in different types of entertainment facilities, large and small, very modern and, of course, the museum. Without fail I see women take to 'Pac-Man', and I see them take to racing games, almost regardless of what the racing game is." 

* Lindsey said the comparative lack of violence in Pole Position and other racing games might explain their popularity with women -- as well as with men. "I think violence in games is fairly thoughtless for men, and for some women, the violence in a video game may stick out," Lindsey said. "Violence in gaming is not an experience that most people seek even though they like video games. When those people find games that are engaging, and that offer outstanding game play, there is a desire on their part to dive into it. These racing games really offer that." 

* Namco notes: The engineers who created Pole Position knew they had created something special when a steering wheel was first connected to the prototype game in their lab. Later, when Pole Position was released, engineers visiting the arcades found that the waiting lines were so long that they curled back and forth within the arcade and then extended out the door.

Pole Position is widely cursed by collectors as having the worst hardware design of any arcade game released in the 1980s. Internal documents that have recently surfaced bear this fact out. The circuit board underwent a large number of modifications and design changes that, while finally allowing the game to function, made the boards fragile. Proof can be found by the piles of Pole Position video PCBs with burnt edge connectors sitting on collectors' workbenches. Working replacement Pole Position PCBs are very hard to find these days, and almost all of the known repair shops won't even look at them, much less attempt to fix them.

Les Lagier holds the official record for this game with 67,310 points.

A Pole Position cockpit model appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

A Pole Position upright model appears in the Judas Priest music video 'Freewheel Burning'. The gameplay shows the head of Rob Halford (lead singer) in the player's car.

- SCORING -

Points are scored for every foot of track driven. 

At the end of the game, 50 points are scored for each car the driver passed. 
Finishing the game awards 200 points for each second left on the timer. 

Qualifying Lap Placement Bonus: 
(Qualifying times vary depending on the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting)
Pole Position (1st place): 4,000 points 
2nd place: 2,000 points 
3rd place: 1,400 points 
4th place: 1,000 points 
5th place: 800 points 
6th place: 600 points 
7th place: 400 points 
8th place: 200 points

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Hints for Game Play: 
1) Avoid puddles and the sides of the track because these slow you down. 
2) Accelerate before the green light appears, and stay ahead of other racers. 
3) Drive to the inside of the track to make the corners. 
4) Successful completion of a turn depends on braking skill. 
5) Engine sound will cue the driver when to shift to high gear.
6) When sliding, steer into the skid. 

* Instead of pressing down on the gas pedal for acceleration, placing your foot underneath the gas pedal and lifting the pedal up with your instep caused the car to go even faster.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Pooyan (c) 1982 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

The player takes on the role of a bow-and-arrow welding pig who must protect her piglets from the pack of hungry wolves ballooning up or down the cliff face. The pig is suspended in a winch-controlled cage and must move vertically up and down, shooting the balloons and sending the wolves plummeting to the ground. Any wolves she misses will, having safely reached the ground, climb a ladder to try and bite her. Also, if any of the wolves reach the ground, more piglets will be captured by them. Mother Pig must try to kill as many wolves as possible without letting them reach the ground.

On the second level, the wolves use balloons to float upwards to the top of a high cliff. If enough of them reach the cliff, they will push a huge boulder down onto Mother Pig's cage. After this level has been completed, the piglets who have been captured are rescued and the game starts over with increased difficulty.

There is also a bonus round where Mother Pig will attempt to eliminate as many wolves on ascending balloons as possible by throwing as few slabs of meat as possible for a maximum bonus score.

- TRIVIA -

Pooyan was released in October 1982 in Japan.

The title is Japanese for 'little pigs'. It is also very rarely used as an adjective meaning 'extremely stupid'. For example, 'Intentionally puncturing your spacesuit is pooyan'. 

The intro tune is a rendition of "The Other Day I Met a Bear" which is a traditional American camp song. The music was composed in 1919 by Carey Morgan and Lee David.

The Round 1 in-game tune is a rendition of 'Humoresque (Op. 101, No. 7 in G flat major)' by Antonin Dvorak. 

Mark Kinter holds the official record for this game with 1609250 points. 

A bootleg of this game is known as "Pootan". 

A Pooyan unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Learn how a meat piece falls: unlike arrows, meat pieces fly not straight but in an arc.

* Throw meat pieces at enemy formations: When arrows are not enough to take out a formation, use meat pieces to wipe them all out. Knowing how a meat piece falls will work in your advantage.

* When to use meat pieces ?: At the end of a level appears a wolf with a balloon hard to pop. Keep the meat piece until the very end and use it against that particular wolf.

* Do not underestimate the power of the balloon: As the game proceeds, there will be balloons with no wolves holding onto them. While it will not count as a miss even if you don't take out these balloons, they bounce off meat pieces. be careful!

* Shoot down rocks with arrows: Rocks thrown by wolves can be reflected with the roof of MAM's gondola and by shooting arrows. Stay calm even if you see a bunch of rocks coming at you.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Challenge star: Successfully complete a stage without losing any lives.

* Bonus Time: Build your weapon to maximum level, then select the same color again. Kill your enemies while in bonus time to increase the score multiplier up to x16.

* Extra Bonus score: Near the end of stage, always are a TOUCH ME helicopter to rescue the civilians you pick un in the stage (not in stage 3 and 6). Instead of droping them there, avoid that helicopter and carry them to the end of the stage and beat the boss, obviously without dying.

- TRIVIA -

By 1995, Atari had begun production of Primal Rage's sequel, simply titled Primal Rage II. The game, however, was never released even though a test arcade cabinet briefly appeared playable at the Golf Land arcade in Sunnyvale, California. A dragon-like boss, which was rumored to be implemented in a future release of the original Primal Rage, was the main antagonist. Though the game never came to be, the story was later adapted into a novel called Primal Rage The Avatars.

The game was to feature new characters that took on the form of humans and were called the Avatars. Another prehistoric fighter which took the form of a Smilodon named Slash Fang (originally called Saber Tooth; he has been around as long as the other gods have, but he never fought for any land) was also planned to appear in the game as well. A boss monster known as Necrosan (what appears to be a living dragon skeleton) which was originally planned for the original game was promised to appear. The original characters were going to remain as well.

Much anticipation centered around the upcoming game. Unfortunately, it wasn't the same for the production. The game didn't get very far in production and Atari felt that the game wouldn't generate enough sales. They later announced the cancellation though not many people knew about it. After that, Primal Rage's popularity died down. A supposedly finished machine of this was shown at the California Extreme 2001 show. The machine had the original board and most of the original art.

		<name>Puck Man</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 42 years ago:

Puckman (c) 1980 Namco.

Puckman is the seminal and hugely influential arcade game in which the player guides the legendary Puckman around a single-screen maze eating dots. Puckman is constantly pursued in his task by four colored ghosts. Each ghost has its own unique personality and behavioural patterns and a single touch from any of the ghosts results in Puckman losing a life. When all of Puckman's lives are lost, the game is over.

Power pills are situated in each corner of the rectangular maze and eating one of these makes Puckman temporarily invincible; the four ghosts also change to dark blue in color and can now be eaten by Puckman. But watch out...a flashing blue ghost indicates that the power pill is about to wear off and the ghosts are about to transform back to their former selves again. Once Puckman eats a blue ghost, this 'skinned' ghost then becomes visible as a pair of eyes only, will return to the ghost pen in the middle of the maze, regenerate into its former self, and return to the maze to continue its pursuit of Puckman. 

Each maze contains 240 dots and 4 power pills, and all must be eaten to complete the level; whereupon the entire sequence begins again with an increased level of difficulty (the action increases in speed and power pills decrease in effectiveness). 

Twice in every level, a bonus fruit or prize item will temporarily appear in the middle of the maze below the ghost pen. Puckman can eat these bonus items to receive extra points. Also, there is an escape tunnel on each side of the maze that Puckman can use to escape any ghosts that are currently closing in on him. The ghosts can also use the tunnel, but take longer to pass through it than Puckman, making escape a little easier. 

Between certain rounds, funny intermissions will be played featuring Puckman and the ghosts in funny situations. Three intermissions are present: 
1) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen and off the side. Then he re-appears running in the opposite direction, having turned blue, followed by a giant Puckman! This intermission is played after Round 2. 
2) The red ghost is again chasing Puckman, but this time he rips his red sheet on a nail on the ground, and we can see his pink body under the sheet! This intermission is played after Round 5. 
3) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen once more, this time with his sheet sewn. They disappear at the left side and then the ghost reappears coming back the opposite direction. This time he is bare and drags his sheet behind him. This intermission is played after Rounds 9, 13 and 17. 

No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.

The original Namco Puckman Upright model came in a white cabinet that may look familiar to most gamers. This cabinet is the same 'swoopy' design used for Pac-Man and Galaxian. The only actual design difference was the coin door. The Japanese version had a tall coin door with a single coin mech, while the U.S. version, Pac-Man, had a fat coin door with two coin mechs installed. However, the graphics on the Japanese machine were completely different from those of the U.S. machine. The marquee had the 'Puckman' logo off to the right-hand side at an angle, and showed a scene with half a dozen cartoon Puckmen eating power pellets, with a few ghosts lingering off to the side. The monitor bezel was largely red and was of a circular design and had many Puckmen lounging around the perimeter of the circle. The control panel continued the reddish graphics and had instructions in Japanese, along with a yellow ball-top 4-Way joystick and Start buttons for each player. The sideart was a large circular sticker that advertised the game's name, and had many cartoon Puckmen in action around the edges of the circle, with the word Namco displayed prominently at the bottom. The cabinet was finished off with yellow t-molding on the edges.

- TRIVIA -

The game was first introduced to the Japanese arcade market on May 22, 1980 and caught the hearts and imaginations of the public like no other game before it, and few since. It is still regarded as the hallmark of the 'golden age' of video games and an icon of 1980's popular culture.

The game was originally known in Japan as Puckman, but due to the West's predilection with changing words to vulgarities by scratching part of the word off (in this case, changing the word 'Puck' to something rather less socially acceptable by scratching off part of the letter 'P'), the name was changed to Pac-Man for its release to the American arcade market in October 1980. The name 'Pac-Man' comes from the Japanese slang term 'paku-paku', which describes the motion of the mouth opening and closing during eating and translates to English as 'to eat'.

Export releases:
[US] "Pac-Man [Model 932]"

Toru Iwatani, author and designer of Puckman: "Puckman's character is difficult to explain even to the Japanese -- he is an innocent character. He hasn't been educated to discern between good and evil. He acts more like a small child than a grown-up person. Think of him as a child learning in the course of his daily activities. If someone tells him guns are evil, he would be the type to rush out and eat guns. But he would most probably eat any gun, even the pistols of policemen who need them." 

Puckman was, quite literally, conceived at lunchtime. Iwatani, then in his mid 20s, was very hungry and ordered himself a pizza for lunch. He took one slice, and, looking at the rest of the pizza, Puckman was born. However, in later years, Iwatini has suggested the shape was based on the Japanese character 'kuchi', meaning mouth. He rounded off this shape, and created the classic shape. The game took 1 1/2 years to complete and had five people on its team. Puckman is the greatest selling arcade game of all time and is arguably also the world's most recognized video-game character of all time. It had its own cartoon, lunch box, board game, stickers and hundreds of other products. This was largely due to Puckman being the first truly distinctive video-game 'character', and it changed the face of video games forever. Puckman was the first video game to be as equally popular to women as it was with men. 

* A place in video game history: "Pac-Man is the most universally known arcade game," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "Everybody knows about Pac-Man. And, I've noticed, almost everybody can play Pac-Man pretty well. Pac-Man makes just about the best use of the joystick one can imagine. It's so intuitive that it puts other games to shame in terms of how easy it is for a person to walk up, stick a quarter in the machine, and start doing something meaningful. At the time, Pac-Man introduced a completely unique style of game play and was also highly identifiable in terms of its music. With Pac-Man, everything was there. The video game industry needs another game that captures the public's heart like Pac-Man, and so far, no one has been able to come up with it." 

* The great 25-cent escape: "People expect to see Pac-Man when they come into the museum, and without fail, when they see it, they want to play it," Lindsey said. "People remember spending hours and hours at Pac-Man. They like to see how good they are now when they play it. And I would say that, perhaps more than any other game, the same playing skills still apply. Perhaps it's because of the intuitive game play. You don't have to memorize the behavior of a wide array of enemies as you do with some other games. You just have to remember that when the ghosts turn blue, you only have seconds, until they start seriously blinking, to go and get them. And Pac-Man is a little looser in its style of game play - more open. For instance, you can kill time in the lower left hand corner until you see an opening between the ghosts, and you can strategize a bit more: You can play with the tunnels, you can play with the position of the ghosts in relation to the energizers. Even people who haven't played in years remember those strategies."

After all these years, the challenge of Pac-Man still remains. 

"You can also get into some really fun jams, when you've got a ghost on your tail and you have to make a decision about whether you're going to go left, or right, or straight at the next junction, which is in .03 seconds," Lindsey said. "It gets to be pretty tense, especially when those ghosts start moving really fast and the energizers aren't lasting as long. Pac-Man can be a real heart-thumping game." 

After the 255th level, Puckman/Pac-Man presents the player with the infamous 'split-screen' level, where the left-half of the screen is normal, but the right-half of the screen is garbled with a mess of letters, numbers, symbols and other graphics. This level cannot be completed because there are not enough dots on screen to be eaten! This is the result of a bug in the routine drawing the fruits at the bottom of the screen, according to the round number. Indeed, the code works as follows: 
1) it increases the last round number by one; 
2) it checks if the result is smaller than 8 (in this case, you still would not have enough fruits to fill the line and some blank space must be drawn); 
3) it checks if the result is larger than 19 (in this case, it has only to draw keys); 
4) finally, it fills the bottom bar with the correct fruits. 

In particular, if the round number is smaller than 8, the game draws as many fruits as the previous round number. This produces an undesirable effect right after the 255th level. 

Indeed, 256 = 255+1 becomes 00 for the CPU (which expects to use the last 2 hexadecimal digits only, and 256 = 100 in hex)! 

Therefore, the game thinks to be in one of the first 7 levels (because 0 is smaller than 7), but it tries to draw 255 fruits (because the last round number was 255). Of course, there is no space for that many fruits to be displayed and the game starts to draw garbage on the main screen. 
Fixing the original code (either through a cheat in emulation, or hacking the roms on the PCB) would results in a 256th level identical to the first one (cherries will appear) but harder, since ghosts will behave as they do in levels beyond the 19th. 

The alien spaceship 'Galaxian' makes an appearance as the prize in the 9th and 10th boards. 

Note: Excluding bootlegs, there are 23 different name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in Puckman/Pac-Man (29 including 'Sue' from 'Ms. Pac-Man', 'Tim' from 'Jr. Pac-Man', 'Common' and 'Grey Common' from the Japanese version of 'Pac-Mania', and 'Funky' and 'Spunky' from the American version of 'Pac-Mania'). 

'Galaxian' boards will run in Pac-Man machines, but the sound pinout is different, so the pinout at the connector would have to be modified. To fire, one would have to press UP on the joystick. 

Billy Mitchell, Rick Fothergill, Chris Ayra, Tim Balderramos and Donald Hayes all hold the official record for this game on 'Regular (TGTS)' settings with a perfect score of 3,333,360 points on July 3, 1999, July 31, 1999, February 16, 2000, December 4, 2004 and July 21, 2005, respectively. 

Chris Ayra holds the official record for the fastest time to get a perfect game on 'Regular' settings with 3:42:05 on April 2, 2002. 

Ron Corcoran holds the official record for this game on 'Speedup' settings with 1,321,020 points on May 13, 2001.

- UPDATES -

The attract mode's title sequence introduces the ghosts with name/nickname combinations displayed on the upper half of the screen. 

The default name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in the original Japanese version are: 
Oikake - "Akabei" (translation: Chaser - "Red Guy") (red ghost)
Machibuse - "Pinky" (translation: Ambusher - "Pink Guy") (pink ghost)  
Kimagure - "Aosuke" (translation: Fickle - "Blue Guy") (cyan ghost) 
Otoboke - "Guzuta" (translation: Stupid - "Slow Guy") (orange ghost)  

The Japanese version also has a DIP switch for alternate name/nickname combinations for the ghosts. These alternate names are: 
Urchin - "Macky" (red ghost) 
Romp - "Micky" (pink ghost) 
Stylist - "Mucky" (cyan ghost) 
Crybaby - "Mocky" (orange ghost) 

The name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in the North American version are: 
Shadow - "Blinky" (red ghost)
Speedy - "Pinky" (pink ghost)
Bashful - "Inky" (cyan ghost)
Pokey - "Clyde" (orange ghost)

Unlike the Japanese version, the American version has no DIP switch for alternate ghost names.

ADDITIONAL NOTES: 

In a later revision ("Japan Set 2" in Mame): 
* At the top of the title screen, instead of 'Nickname', it says 'Ghost'. 
* The 'Press Start' screen displays 1981 as the year of release, instead of 1980.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The number of lives Puckman starts with depends on the 'Lives' dip switch setting (1, 2, 3, or 5; the default is 3).

* An extra life is awarded based on the 'Extra Lives' dip switch setting (10,000, 15,000, 20,000, or None; the default is 10,000). 

* Fruits appear twice on each board. The first fruit appears after Puckman has eaten 70 dots; the second fruit appears once there are only 70 dots remaining in the maze. 

* At the beginning of a round, the ghosts won't immediately pursue Puckman. Use this time the best as you can. 

* Puckman can turn corners faster than the ghosts can, so turning many corners can help you escape ghosts. 

* The tunnel allows Puckman and the ghosts to instantly travel from one side of the maze to the other. While traveling through the tunnel, Puckman moves at normal speed, but the ghosts' speed is reduced in half. This provides Puckman with a good opportunity to put some distance between him and the ghosts, but be careful not to get trapped by another ghost entering the opposite side. 

* Stall Puckman from entering the tunnel and then, just before the ghosts reach him, send him through the tunnel. By attracting the ghosts to one side of the screen, you reduce Puckman's chances of meeting them when he emerges on the other side of the screen.

* If you hold the joystick in a direction that is blocked by a wall, Puckman will turn in that direction as soon as he reaches a passage leading in that direction. Remember this to turn corners as fast as you can. 

* Remember that eating dots will slow Puckman down a little bit: avoid parts of the maze in which you've not been yet if you are trying to escape ghosts! 

* Try not to eat power pills until the ghosts are near. The longer Puckman waits, the closer the ghosts get, and the easier it is for Puckman to eat them once they have turned blue. 

* Mind that, as the levels increases, the ghost speed increases as well! 

* In later rounds, you're not going to be able to eat ghosts after eating a power pill, because the vulnerability time decreases to zero. This is when you need to learn how to avoid the ghosts understanding their movement and their moving patterns! 

* Right above the ghost pen, there are two paths leading upward to the upper part of the maze. The ghosts never travel upward through these holes while they're in their normal forms; they only do while they're blue after Puckman has eaten a power pill. Indeed, they only exit the area around the ghost pen from the sides or the bottom. These are not completely safe corners, since ghosts can travel downward through them, anyway they often represents a safe passage to flee from ghosts pursuing you around the ghost pen. 

* Ghosts' Movements: First of all, remember that ghosts are not always following you! Their movements follow two distinct phases: one in which they avoid Puckman and one in which they hunt him down. In the former phase, each ghost patrols his personal corner of the maze. In the latter one, they will try to find Puckman, following their personal 'behavior': 
1) The red ghost tends to patrol the top-right corner of the maze and he follows Puckman always trying to minimize their respective distance. 
2) The pink ghost tends to patrol the top-left corner of the maze and he follows Puckman trying to reach a position slightly in front of Puckman, in the direction he's moving. 
3) The cyan ghost tends to patrol the bottom-right corner of the maze and he has the most complicated AI since he moves towards a point determined by both Puckman's position and the red ghost's position. 
4) The orange ghost tends to patrol the bottom-left corner of the maze and he only tries to be close to Puckman, without hunting him directly. 

Ghosts alternate these two different behaviors (hiding and hunting) a few times in each round, then they start to pursue Puckman restlessly until all the dots are eaten, or they manage to catch him. 

Additionally, as soon as a certain number of dots has been cleared from the maze (this number decreases as the levels pass), the red ghost's speed will increase and he won't stop to search for Puckman anymore.

Pulstar (c) 1995 Aicom.

Pulstar is a sideways scrolling shoot-em-up set in the year 2248, in which the first recorded sign of alien life is discovered on Mars. A signal emanates from the red planet and from it an object is observed travelling at light-speed out of the Solar System. Earth scientists are wary of what this could mean and warn the world's defenses to prepare for a possible attack.

Eight years later, an alien fleet follows the signal and begins attacking the human space craft awaiting them in Neptune's orbit. The battle spreads throughout the Solar System and within two years Neptune is destroyed, Jupiter is turned into a star and more than half of Earth's continents disappear from rising ocean levels and the planet's changing axis as a result. Kaoru Yamazaki, lone fighter pilot of the Dino246, is one of the few survivors of the Pulstar attack force, founded to save the Solar System from the alien invaders.

Pulstar borrows many of its visual and gameplay elements from all three games in Irem's legendary "R-Type" series, including the Beam weapon and R-type's infamous pod attachment. Unlike "R-Type", however, Pulstar's pod cannot be detached from the front of the ship and merely acts as a shield to protect the player's ship.

The game includes a weapon power bar which consists of two halves. The right-hand side of the bar turns blue when the fire button is held down and when released, it delivers a devastating beam of energy. The left-hand side turns red when the fire button is pressed repeatedly in quick succession, shooting out a barrage of smaller, rapid blasts.

Pulstar consists of eight challenging levels, with the player able to start the game on any one of the first four.

		<name>Q*bert</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Q*bert (c) 1982 Gottlieb.

The object of the Q*bert game is to change the color of the top of the cubes to the Destination Color indicated at the upper-left corner of the screen (below Player 1's score) by hopping onto them. When all the cubes in the pyramid have been changed to the Destination Color, the screen will advance to the next round, with the player-controlled Q*bert character starting back on the top cube. At the beginning of each level, there will be a short demonstration cycle with Q*bert hopping around four cubes to explain to the player the play action of each level. Each level consists of four rounds. The current level number and round number is displayed at the upper-right corner of the screen (below Player 2's score in a 2-player game).

Gameplay starts with Q*bert appearing at the top of the pyramid. The joystick will move Q*bert from cube to cube by hopping in any of four diagonal directions. Q*bert can move anywhere on the pyramid, but jumping off will kill him. Hopping onto a rotating disk will take Q*bert back to the top of the pyramid. In the first two rounds of play, Q*bert will have to avoid touching the red and purple balls. These deadly objects drop randomly onto the second-from-the-top row of the pyramid and bounce downwards. The red balls will fall off the bottom, but the purple ball will stop at the bottom and hatch into Coily, the snake which chases Q*bert. To get rid of Coily, lure him to the edge, then jump unto a disk. The disk will take Q*bert back to the top and Coily will fall off, awarding 500 points and clearing the board of all other 'nasty' characters.

Starting at the third round of play, other 'nasty' characters come into play. The green characters or objects are safe to hop onto and will award points. All other 'nasty' characters are deadly to touch. In the third round the red balls will stop falling, but two purple characters named Ugg and Wrong Way will appear at the lower portion of the pyramid and travel sideways and upwards (Ugg is the one with the snout moving from right to left on the right face of the cubes, and Wrong Way is the one with the big eyes moving from left to right on the left face of the cubes). They will not chase Q*bert, but will move randomly to get in Q*bert's way. In the third round and every round after, based on an internal timer, a green ball will appear and bounce down from the top of the pyramid. Hopping Q*bert onto the green ball will award 100 points, and freeze all the 'nasty' characters on the screen for a few seconds, but 'Q*bert' will still be able to move to complete the color changes.

During the fourth round of play, two green characters named Slick and Sam will appear, based on the internal timer (Slick is the one wearing shades; Sam does not wear shades, otherwise their function is identical). They will drop onto the second-from-the-top row of the pyramid and hop randomly downwards. If they hop onto a cube that Q*bert has already changed the color of, the cube will change to a different color to thwart Q*bert. Hopping Q*bert onto Slick or Sam will stop them and award 300 points.

Throughout the remaining rounds, all the characters and objects will appear in random combinations with increasing speed.

To add variety to the game, the disks will change positions every round, and in the higher levels the number of disks will change.

During Level 2, the play action will increase in difficulty from changing the cubes to one color, to changing the color of the cubes twice. This means that each cube would have to be hopped on twice to change the pyramid to the Destination Color, completing the Round.

Starting at Level 3 and for all remaining rounds, and levels, the play action will become more difficult. The object remains to change the cubes to the Destination Color, but if Q*bert hops on any cube, that cube will change color. So even if the cube has already been changed to the Destination Color, it will change again.

Here is a rundown of how all the colors change:

Legend:
S - Starting Color
I - Intermediate Color
D - Destination Color

LEVEL 1: When Q*bert jumps on S or I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D (NOTE: During the fourth round, when Slick/Sam jumps on D, it changes to I).

LEVEL 2: When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D.

LEVEL 3: When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.

LEVEL 4: When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to I. Q*bert must start again.

LEVEL 5: When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.

LEVELS 6-9: Same color pattern as Level 5. The difference is the increased speed of Q*bert and the 'nasty' characters.

There are also bonus points awarded at the end of each round for successfully completing the round. The bonus for the completion of the 1st round is 1,000 points. This Bonus will progressively increase each Round by 250 points to a maximum of 5,000 points at Level 5.

- TRIVIA -

Q*bert was released in October 1982 in the USA.

Licensed to Konami for Japanese distribution (February 1983).

Inspired by artwork by M.C. Escher who was an artist that Jeff admired. Ron Waxman came up with the idea of Q*bert changing the color of the cubes. Q*bert's name originated by the combination of 'Cube' and 'Hubert', but the 'Cube-Bert' was changed to 'Q-bert' to make it more unique. The concept game was called 'Snots and Boogers' and then '@!#?@!' (which many of the programmers and Gottlieb VPs said would be impossible to get anyone to say) before the final version was called just 'Q*bert'. Slick and Sam were a play on the phrase 'spick and span' with Sam being named after co-worker Sam Russo. Rick Tighe came up with the idea of adding the pinball hardware which generated the very mechanical KA-CHUNK when Q*bert falls off the pyramid.

A Votrax SC-01 speech synthesis chip is used to generate the incoherent speech of Q*bert swearing, Slick and Sam (high pitch), and Ugg and Wrong Way (low pitch). The only true speech ever generated is Q*bert saying 'Hello, I'm turned on' when the game is first powered up and 'Bye Bye' after the player enters his or her initials at the end of a game.

Approximately 30,000 units were produced by Gottlieb.

Several early cabinets were produced with '@!#?@!' on the marquee.

Bob Gerhardt holds the official records for this game in 'Marathon' setting with 33,273,520 points on November 28, 1983.

Tom Gault holds the official records for this game in 'Tournament' setting with 1,895,565 points.

A slightly different version known as 'Mello Yello' was programmed for promotion of the Mellow-Yellow soft drink, but it was never released to the market.

As well as being a huge commercial success as a game, Q*bert also provided revenue from its many tie-in products. Toys, games, and other products bearing the hero’s likeness all sold well. There was even a Q*bert cartoon; Saturday Supercade was a CBS cartoon series which featured a number of different segments starring various video game characters. In addition to the characters from the game, the Q*Bert segment featured Q*tee (Q*bert's girlfriend), Q*bit (his little brother), and others.

Such was the character's popularity at this time that Gottlieb assigned pinball designer, John Trudeau ("Creature From the Black Lagoon", "Congo"), to devise a Q*bert pinball. It was called "Q*bert's Quest" and Trudeau created an innovative design pattern that should have sparked arcade goers to try it. Remarkably, the table was a commercial flop. Released in March 1983, a paltry 884 machines dribbled out of the plant and further convinced management that pinball was indeed experiencing desperate times.

A Q*bert unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'.

Parker Brothers released a board game based on this videogame (same name) in 1983. The object of the game is to be one of the 'noser elite' by removing more pegs from the pyramid than your opponent. A peg plugged into a cube simulates the Starting Color; a peg removed from a cube simulates the Destination Color. One player takes on the role of the hero, Q*bert, who must make his way around the pyramid trying to remove as many pegs as he can. A second player controls the 'nasty' characters out to thwart Q*bert. This board game has Ugg and Wrong Way reversing their positions; Ugg moves from left to right on the left face of the cubes, and Wrong Way moves from right to left on the right face of the cubes. Also, Slick is featured in the board game, but not Sam.

The main characters make an appearance on the 2012 animation movie "Wreck-It Ralph" from Walt Disney Animation Studios.

- SCORING -

Q*bert changes a cube from the Starting Color to the Intermediate Color: 15 points (NOTE: In Level 4, you get no points when Q*bert changes a cube from the Destination Color back to the Intermediate Color.)
Q*bert changes a cube to the Destination color: 25 points.
Q*bert catches the Green Ball: 100 points
Q*bert catches Slick/Sam: 300 points.
Q*bert lures Coily off the pyramid: 500 points bonus.
Bonus points for every round you complete: 750 points + 250 points x round number + 50 points per remaining disk.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Control Panel Instructions:
Goal: Change the tops of all cubes to a new color by hopping onto them.
Joystick moves 'Q*bert' from cube to cube. Hopping onto a disk will take you back to the top.
All green objects are safe to hit. All other objects are deadly.
Destroy the snake by leading him to the edge, then jumping on a disk.
Stay on pyramid! Only jump off to use a disk.

* A big part of the game is waiting to see where 'nasty' characters are going to jump. You need to make sure you always time a jump at the same time the 'nasty' characters jump, so you can always have a clear path to a new square.

* Since the game only has nine levels, if you can master Level 9 then you should be able to play indefinitely since Level 9 repeats once you reach it and the game doesn't get any harder.

		<name>Rally X</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 42 years ago:

Rally-X (c) 1980 Namco, Limited.

In Rally-X, the player drives a car around a maze picking up all of the yellow flags, of which there are ten, before the car's fuel runs out. The game-play has a similar feel to another Namco legend, "Pac-Man"; although in Rally-X, the mazes are much larger and, with each maze having only ten flags to collect, is more sparsely populated than Namco's pill-eating legend.

In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the player's car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than the player's. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player's car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash. Each maze also has rock formations which, if crashed into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right hand side of the playing area shows the positions of both the flags, and the enemy vehicles.

- TECHNICAL -

Main CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)
Sound Chips: Namco 3-channel WSG and discrete circuitry for the crash sound.

Players: 2
Control: 4-way joystick
Buttons: 1 (SMOKE SCREEN)

- TRIVIA -

Rally-X was released in Japan on November 22, 1980.

- UPDATES -

In the introduction to the bonus stages, the Namco version misspells 'Challenging' as 'Charanging'. This was corrected in the Midway version.

- SCORING -

Collecting a flag: 100 points x the flag collected up to a maximum of 1,000 points. If you lose a life, the points awarded will reset to 100 when you restart.

Collecting the Special Flag: Doubles points for the Special Flag and all flags collected thereafter until you clear the round or lose a life. If you clear the entire round without losing a single life, the tenth flag is always worth 2,000 points because it is guaranteed that at some point, you will have collected the Special Flag. However, losing a life will cancel out the Special Flag's scoring effect when you restart.

End of stage bonus: Points for remaining fuel

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Your only goal is to collect all ten flags as quickly as possible. You need to pay constant attention to two things: the zoomed in view of the world that occupies most of the screen, and the radar view of the world to the right.

* The radar view provides you with two key pieces of information: the relative position of the flags in the world, and the proximity of the enemy cars to yours. Yellow dots in the radar view denote the flags' locations, red dots represent the enemy cars, and the dot flashing black and gray represents you.

* The method you use for collecting the flags is of utmost importance. It is usually best to try to hop from one flag to whichever flag is closest, but the enemies will make that quite difficult to do. As a general rule, do not reverse your direction unless it is absolutely necessary and completely safe to do. If you have to choose between getting close to an enemy to pick up a nearby flag, and abandoning that flag for a farther flag, go for the farther flag. The more distance you put between you and the other cars, the safer you will remain.

* In general, you will be safe off if you choose a direction to collect flags, clockwise or counter-clockwise, and stick to it throughout the duration of the stage. The smokescreen is an invaluable and incredibly tempting tool to use. But if you use it excessively, you will deplete your fuel supply very rapidly, making it more likely that you will run out of fuel before you collect all ten flags, which will almost ensure your demise.

* Challenging stages occur before each maze change, which occurs each time the round number is one less than a multiple of four (the challenging stages occur on the third, seventh, and every fourth round thereafter. In these stages, you are free to collect all of the flags without being harassed by enemy cars until your fuel runs out. However, you can still crash into parked cars and rocks, so be careful.

* Easter Egg: 
1) Enter service mode.
2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence: UP(x2), DOWN(x7), RIGHT, LEFT(x6)
3) '(c) Namco LTD. 1980' will be added at the bottom of the screen.

- TRIVIA -

Rastan was released in March 1987. It was originally known in Japan as "Rastan Saga".

This export version has some differences from the original Japanese version:
- In the attract mode, a description of the objects appears instead of the original opening sequence.
- The game is hardest at some points. If you waste too many time without advancing in the stage, 8 bats will attack you (instead of 2 in the original version).
- Also in the original Japanese version, when the player complete a Round, the victory screen has text pertaining to the storyline. In the overseas versions, there is a generic victory screen with generic text (You are a brave warrior for having cleared such a stage).

- TRIVIA -

This game was shown at the 1998 AOU Amusement Expo show, in Japan. it was then released in March 1998.

The title of the game translates from Japanese as 'Real Bout Hungry Wolf Legend 2'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 - The Newcomers'.

Things that changed in this particular game:
* The game now features 'single plane' stages (like the ones seen in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", "Fatal Fury 2" &amp; "Fatal Fury Special") in which you can slam enemies against background objects!
* The breakable objects system seen in Real Bout Special is gone. Also the "evil character" versions of some characters are gone as well.
* Newcomers in this game are: Li Xiangfei, Rick Strowd &amp; Alfred.

A serious bug: Using a USA bios ROM if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tile-set rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the main-board z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after game-over, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Real Bout Garou Densetsu 2 The Newcomers / PCCB-00310) on April 17, 1998.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Fight against Alfred: Begin game play in single player mode, finish off the first 10 fights with no losses, score over 750000 by the time the 10th fight is won, land 5 P.POWER moves or 7 S.POWER moves. You will fight Alfred in a desert type stage.

* You may scope out each character's best records by tapping A button to move forward or B button to move back at the score ranking screen:).

- UPDATES -

MVS (Arcade) vs. AES (Neo-Geo) differences:
On the AES (Neo-Geo) Geese is a playable character by imputing a code. On the MVS (Arcade) version he was removed as a playable character for being too strong.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Shadow/EX Fighter: Shadow/EX fighter is an evil version of the selected character with a different move-list set as well as a different ending than his/her original counterpart. This code only works with the following characters: Andy Bogard, Billy Kane, Blue Mary, Tung Fu Rue.
1) At the character selection screen, highlight the character of your choice, hold Start and press B(x2), C(x2).
2) While continuing to hold Start, hold B, pause one second and hold C.
3) While continuing to hold Start+B+C, press A or D to select the Shadow version of the character.
4) Pressing A or D will select a different color.

* Fight against Geese Howard: Begin game play in single player mode, win all rounds, do not score less than a 'B' rank in any battle and get more than 750,000 points befire fighting Wolfgang Krauser. You will fight Geese Howard in a special 'Nightmare' match.

* You can see different sets of funny outtakes during the credits if you consecutively beat the game 5 or 6 times before they start to repeat themselves.

- TRIVIA -

Return of the Invaders was released in September 1985.

Some outsourcing works for this game were done by UPL and Comix (trigger by little codebase change, their Japanese firm members are show via the screen).

The development name of the game was "Space Invaders Part 3". Return of The Invaders was developed by UPL for Taito. For a small softco like UPL, working on the Space Invaders franchise was a great opportunity to gain notoriety within the videogame industry. Unfortunately, Taito neglected to mention UPL in the finished game.

Rezon (c) 1991 Allumer, Limited.

A reasonably playable, if wholly unremarkable sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up that unashamedly rips off Irem's legendary "R*Type". Unfortunately, Rezon lacks any of R*Type's innovations in either level design or the weapons available to the player. One attribute it does share with the Irem classic, however, is that it is extremely difficult.

Robo Army (c) 1991 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku]. 

Robo Army is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players who take on the roles of two cybernetically-enhanced soldiers called Rocky and Maxima and must attempt to stop am invading cyber army called 'Hell Jeed' from enslaving the human race.

The game uses three buttons: 
A - Attack
B - Jump
C - Energy blast

Hitting the jump and attack button simultaneously lets Rocky and Maxima attack behind them. Collecting energy balls makes the energy blast more powerful, similar to the magic potions in Sega's "Golden Axe". One major difference, however, is that the special attack here can be used several times to diminishing effect before it finally runs out.

Players can often pick up a fallen robot's limb to club other robots to death with. Also, if players approach a weakened enemy and press forward and the A button at the right time, Maxima or Rocky will rip the enemy in half.

Finally, a defeated enemy will occasionally drop a glowing icon of a human fist. Picking this up causes Rocky or Maxima to bend over and transform into a futuristic buggy-like vehicle. Any enemies Maxima and Rocky touch while in buggy form instantly explode while hitting the attack button allows them to speed across the screen to quickly run enemies down. The buggy only lasts for a limited time, however.

		<name>Robocop</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 34 years ago:

RoboCop - The Future of Law Enforcement (c) 1988 Data East.

RoboCop is a single player horizontally-scrolling platform shoot-em-up based on the 1987 movie of the same name. The game's story mirrors that of the film, with former city cop Murphy, now a half-human cyborg called 'RoboCop', on a mission to bring down the evil OCP corporation that created him.

The game features nine levels of action. Seven of these are platform-based stages that comprise the main game, with the additional two stages being into-the-screen target ranges. The ranges are effectively bonus stages, in which players accrue points by shooting as many targets as possible within a time limit. Additional player health is then awarded depending on the amount of points earned.

In the platform-based stages, wooden crates and barrels occasionally bar RoboCop's progress, these can be punched to remove them. Robocop is armed with an infinite-ammo machine pistol, but one of three weapon upgrades can be found hidden inside marked wooden crates (or occasionally dropped by defeated enemies). The three possible upgrades are; Three-way Gun, Dual Laser or the incredibly powerful Cobra Gun. The power-ups have only a limited number of shots, however, with remaining shots displayed in the upper-right corner of the screen.

As well as weapons, small jars of baby food can also be found (again, mirroring the movie) that when picked up, will restore some of Robocop's health.

During the game, Robocop will occasionally come across a criminal holding a girl hostage. He must kill the criminal without killing the hostage, otherwise some of Robocop's health is lost. The criminal will periodically duck while firing, Robocop must also duck but to avoid killing the hostage, must only shoot while the criminal is ducking. 

The film's incidental music plays throughout the game and RoboCop's speech is sampled directly from the original film.

- TRIVIA -

RoboCop was released in November 1988. 

After Ocean Software secured the RoboCop license, they sub-licensed it to Data East who created the coin-up game. Ocean then ported the game to various home computers. 

Most of RoboCop's sounds were borrowed from "Heavy Barrel". 

A Robocop Cabinet can be seen in the Nickelodeon shows All That (from 1994 to 1997) and Kenan and Kel. However both shows shared the same cabinet, but with different fictional marquees. 

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (G.S.M. Data East 1 - D25B1002) on June 21, 1989.

The bootleg version does not use the HuC6280 @ 1.342325 Mhz:-)

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

The following cheat for RoboCop can earn (theoretically) infinite scores: There exists a level in the game (the Junkyard), where there is an elevator. It's just after you get the Cobra gun. Anyway, you get on the elevator and ride to the top. When the elevator reaches the top, DON'T MOVE! Your score will suddenly start to increase, and will continue to do so until you step off the elevator.

Bad guys come onto the screen when you pass a certain pixel. Move back and kill them off; don't charge through the game. Learn the enemy movement patterns as they are the same in every play.

Here are some strategies for each level: 

* LEVEL ONE: The motorbike which damages you before you draw your gun can be beaten by jumping just before it comes on the screen. A shop window has a small menu type poster in it; jump around about there. When you land, punch the bike (it flashes green and doesn't damage you). Punch it when it returns to kill it.

When fighting the ED209, time your jumps until just AFTER it has fired at you, allowing you to jump over its shots. When it moves to the left third of the screen, stand close to it. RoboCop's weapons arm will now point at a steeper angle (more into the ground). Now move away slightly and jump away when ED209 fires. Its shots will go into the ground and not trap you at the left edge of the screen.

Another approach allows you to defeat the ED-209 almost instantaneously: First, make sure you still have the Three-Way Gun (not essential but makes things a little quicker and easier), then as soon as you clear the area of enemies the music will change and the ED-209 will growl. Simply walk to the right side of the screen (Before ED-209 enters) and fire repeatedly diagonally up and right. If done correctly, the ED-209 will come out already defeated and run away without so much as scratching you.

* LEVEL TWO ; To get extra health, shoot the fat guy using a girl as a shield. He moves forward to shoot at you - shoot him then.

Target practice: Getting all of the targets (100% hit) gives *extra* capacity for your energy bar.

Bug: Missing one target sometimes still gives 100% (but don't rely on it.).

* LEVEL THREE: Go over the top of the car crushers, and pick up the baby food. Try and save the Cobra assault cannon for the end of the level - this makes thing much easier. If you shoot just under the cab of the final enemy, you can kill the guy throwing grenades at you.

Alternate way: Get the cobra cannon, clean all the enemies at the elevator, the raise the elevator until the cobra cannon is slightly higher than ground level (about 1/4 inch or less), fire ONCE to the right and watch your score soar. Don't move or your score will stop. Also, this only works on the bootleg board - the original did not do this, probably due to a bug (At the far right, just outside of the screen, are some boxes and the machine thinks you hit them but doesn't destroy them).

* LEVEL FOUR: Shoot the metal crushers with the Cobra Cannon, or PUNCH repeatedly if you get trapped. The final enemy is a crane which swings a steel ball suspended from an extensible chain. Don't shoot the wooden box, stand on it and shoot the cab of the crane. Also, try to save the Cobra Cannon (by punching bad guys instead of shooting them) and use it on the crane.

* LEVEL FIVE: Don't charge through this level, especially on the conveyor belt. Be wary of the first guy armed with a flame thrower; if you're quick enough, you can shoot him before he gets a chance to shoot at you.

The military ED209 at the end of the level can be beaten by crouching under the OCP logo when it charges. Jump and shoot the weapon arm when it retreats.

* LEVEL SIX: You need to move through this level fairly quickly as time is a little tight. The ground-based moving gun turrets can be shot from the platform below, and careful diagonal shooting can destroy laser emplacements situated on any platforms above you. Concentrate on laser turrets which are diagonally away from you, as their fire is the hardest to dodge.

The last baby food on the level replenishes all of RoboCop's energy. Try and keep the laser shots until the end of the level. When you reach the top platform, move as far to the right as possible and shoot the military ED209 as much as possible before it activates. There is a comparatively safe position just at the end of the military ED209's forward walk (like the end of level five, but with no OCP marker). Kill the military ED209 first. Tactics for the other ED209 are similar to those of level 1.

* LEVEL SEVEN: Use diagonal shooting to destroy laser turrets on the platform above you (see also Level Six comment).

The baby food stored in the box gives all your energy back. When you reach the single lift which goes up multiple floors, the best way to avoid being trapped on it by laser fire is to JUMP onto the next level just before the lift reaches it. Timing between the laser shots is critical.

When this lift reaches the top, stop just short of the floor (you should be able to see/hear the light curtains and laser turrets) and then go back down as far as you can. The laser turrets and curtains sometimes disappear.

The final ED209 can be destroyed by standing at the far left of the screen and jumping up and down. Missiles launched at you can be destroyed by shooting or punching. When the ED209 gets too close, use the tactic of level one.

When ED209 is destroyed, kill Dick Jones (in the same way as a gunman holding a hostage is killed). The president is not harmed by your gun shots and must be punched from close range.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Robotron: 2084 (c) 1982 Williams.

Robotron: 2084 is a single-screen shoot-em-up set in a near future in which mankind has developed super-intelligent, self-aware robots called Robotrons, in order to aid mankind and to build a better world. The robots quickly realised that they don't need the Human Race and have revolted against their creators, vowing to either genetically reprogram the remaining humans to side with the Robotrons, or to wipe them out entirely. 

The player takes on the role of the single human who due to a malfunction in his genetic engineering, cannot be re-programmed by the Robotrons. The free-minded human must destroy the enemy Robotrons and rescue as many of the Earth's remaining human families as possible. 

Robotron: 2084 utilizes a dual joystick control system, with the left stick controlling player movement and the right controlling the direction of fire. The player's only weapon is an Anti-Robot Laser Gun. Each single-screen wave is populated with enemy robots and obstacles, as well as human family members who can be rescued to earn additional points. 

There are three types of trapped humans; Man, Woman and Child and they will wander aimlessly until the player makes contact with them. If a Robotron touches them first, they are either killed or, if touched by the brain-like Robotron, converted into enemy 'progs. 

In addition to the Robotrons, each wave also features static obstacles called Electrodes. These pulsating objects can block the player's path and a collision with one results in instant death. Electrodes come in a number of different shapes and must be avoided or destroyed with the Laser Gun.

ENEMY ROBOTRON UNITS:

* GRUNT: The least sophisticated species of Robot is the Grunt. It has no weapon and possesses only minimal intelligence. Grunts appear in large numbers and will relentlessly pursue players to overrun and destroy them. Each Grunt killed is worth 100 points.

* TANK: Its goal is to kill the player using rebounding Shells. Annihilate the Tank for 300 points; the Shell for 50 points.

* SPHEROID: This pulsating sphere may initially look harmless, but it is the mother-ship that spawns deadly 'Enforcer Embryos'. Players must try to destroy the Spheroid before it ejects the Embryos to earn 1,000 points.

* ENFORCER: The Embryos grow into evil Enforcers. Kill them for 200 points. Let them live and they will lessen the player's chance for survival by launching Enforcer Sparks. Destroy the Sparks for 25 points.

* HULK: In all attack waves except every 5th, the Hulk will stalk his prey. Hulk units are invincible but the player's Gun can only slow it down or divert it from its objective. 

* BRAIN: The Brain is the most clever and dangerous of the Robotrons. Its two-pronged attack will be launched every 5th wave. If it touches the player, it will electrocute them where they stand. It can also fire Cruise Missiles that will relentlessly follow the player until either contact is made or they are shot and destroyed. Kill the Brain for 500 points; destroy the Cruise Missile for 75 points.

The victims of the 2nd prong of the Brain's attack are the defenseless humans. If captured, a human will be irreversibly transformed - literally re-programmed by the Brain's incredible mind powers - into a Prog: a Robot that will viciously turn against its own protector, the player. Annihilate the Progs for 100 points or meet a violent death at their hands.

- TECHNICAL -

Robotron was available in both upright and cocktail format, with the cocktail cabinet being fairly rare. The alternate cabinets also had different graphics (at least the color scheme was different), and are much more difficult to find replacement graphics for. The standard Robotron upright was 6'2" tall and featured white sides and a black front. It had painted side-art in the form of a '2084' logo and a few stripes (this is a very simple design, and is easy to repaint if your cabinet happens to be scratched up). The control panel is covered with a geometric shape design, and has two 8-Way joysticks and two start buttons. These joysticks are of a peculiar design, but can easily be replaced with a pair of modern joysticks (purchase red ball tops ones, because that is what the originals had). The games marquee has the 'Robotron' logo in a font reminiscent of an early 80s computer. This is superimposed over a triangular design made from shapes and lines. The Robotron cocktail cabinet was finished completely with woodgrain laminate. The only graphics were on the control panels, and the small instruction cards that were placed under the top glass. The players would sit across from each other, and the screen image would flip for each player.

- TRIVIA -

Robotron: 2084 was released in March 1982 in the USA.

Total production is estimated at 18,000 units. The upright cabinet style is common. Both the cabaret (or mini) and cocktail styles were produced in much lower numbers, one estimate citing only 500 cocktails produced. 

The basic play of Robotron was programmed in three days. The design of Robotron was influenced by "Berzerk" and the Commodore PET game 'Chase'. The concept name was 'Robot Wars - 1984'. 

The original name for the production was '2084 - Robotron', but the name Robotron was more commonly used by virtually everyone involved, and the game was renamed shortly before production. This is why the cabinet side artwork simply has the number 2084 vertically. 

Robotron was unique at the time in that the controls were two 8-way joysticks (one for running, one for shooting) rather than the more typical single joystick and fire button. This unique dual-joystick control was created because of two occurrences: Jarvis liked the game Berzerk, but hated the joystick-and-button run-and-shoot configuration; and the fact that Jarvis's right hand had been broken in a car accident shortly after he finished creating Stargate. 

This game shares some sounds from "Defender" and "Stargate". 

The human characters in this game are named Mommy, Daddy and Mikey. The idea and the inspiration for the character Mikey was from the 1970's commercial for 'Life' cereal. 

Williams were sued by Walt Disney Productions for copyright and patent infringement regarding Williams use of 'Tron' in Robotron. Williams won the suit and Walt Disney releases Tron on time. 

A Robotron machine appears in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance' and on the 1986 movie 'Better Off Dead'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your man will be in the middle of the playing field surrounded by various robots. Depending on the wave that you are on will determine exactly what robots are ready to terminate your existence. The game is straight-forward, take out all the robots (except HULKS) to advance to the next wave. It is vital for your survival that you learn how to 'scoot and shoot'. If you don't learn how operate the controls independently and run in one direction while shooting in other directions, you won't survive very long in this game.

* Equally important to 'scoot and shoot' is your ability to be able to fire on the diagonal. It's easy firing up, down, left, and right, but it takes a little more mastery to fire in the diagonal directions.

* Learn the different things the enemy robots do. For example, the SPEROIDS have a tendency to congregate in the corners. This works to your advantage since you can blast about three or four before they discharge their supply of ENFORCER robots.

* Your main objective is to blast a path through the robots and get to the edge of the screen. It doesn't matter what edge, just get to one. The reason is painfully simple: it give the robots one less direction to assault you from. Plus, you can lead them around in circles blasting them and also cleaning out the corners from the above-mentioned ENFORCERS.

* Enforcer Bug: The enforcer bug is when an enforcer is in the lower right corner and you shoot it diagonal there is a 1 in 3,000 chance the game will reset. The reason for the game resetting is there is a bug in the diagonal explosion code for enforcers. The memory below the screen holds the stack and an unclipped pixel can get 'drawn' into the stack causing the game to lock and the watchdog to kick in and reset the system.

* The only times where you won't want to seek the sides is during the BRAIN and TANK robot waves. The BRAINS fire a homing shot at your man so you need as much room to maneuver as possible so going against the wall would restrict that movement. The same goes for the TANK robots which fire bounce shots. They may miss you initially but you might get hit by the shot as it bounces up. You are safer in the middle area where you have room to maneuver. Just watch out for other enemies (which will be very low in number).

* Try to rescue the humans as long as it doesn't put your man in danger of dying. You can rack up some major points on the BRAIN waves since they are loaded with humans for the BRAIN robots to 're-program'. Again, make sure you have an avenue of escape. Doesn't make sense to save a human, get the extra man, then die. You, in essence, gained nothing from that level. You can also shoot the HULK robots to push them away from humans also. On the BRAIN waves, make sure you pick off the BRAIN robots as soon as possible. This prevents them from reprogramming the humans and leaves you more people to get major points with.

* The 'Mikey' bug - on the first Brain wave. There are a lot of Mommies and only one Mikey. The Brains all go for Mikey - if you can protect him (don't pick him up, though!), the Brains will ignore all other humans, making for a point-fest if you can grab them all. As soon as you die, however, the Brains will grab any human they find. This actually works on all Brain waves, but in the other waves the 'golden human' is a random Daddy or Mommy or Mikey, so you don't know who to protect. It's a bug, but a cool one. For this bug to work, the player must make sure that no humans are left alive in the level previous.

* Since you don't have a limit on your shots, you can put up a 'wall' of energy in whatever direction you move. This can have a very devastating effect if applied right.

* Make sure you take a quick look at the wave to assess where the main threats are. You will have from one to two seconds to get ready for action. If you can survive the initial few seconds as you blast your way toward the edge, your chances of survival will be that much greater. Also be sure to remember what each wave has in store for you, this also will give you a greater chance of getting through the wave.

* If you get tired, you can take a break. That's right, wait for a TANK wave. Eliminate all of the robots except for one. After firing a few shots, the TANK robot will run out. After that, it's just a matter of avoiding the TANK and any other pesky robots.

* During the tank wave, try to avoid shooting the tanks shots for as long as you can. If the tanks fire 20 shots that do not hit anything, the tanks will cease firing.

* ENFORCERS, like their SPHEROID transports, tend to congregate in corners. Use this to your advantage.  Every now and then one or two will zip very fast across the field. Their main threat, though, is volume of fire. When you are on the edges, watch out since their shots tend to roll toward your man.

* See all those pretty shapes on the playing field? They are there as a nuisance. They will kill your man if he hits them. They can, however, be shot out of the way but yield no points.

* Robotron Name Trick: The formula consists of three sequences of buttons, that all must be completed within a quarter of a second of each other, without the player dying on-screen. The moves are as follows...
1) Fire Up while moving Right and press Player 1 button.
2) Fire Down while moving Up and press Player 2 button.
3) Move Down while firing Up.
The designer's names will appear and stay on the screen until the joystick is released from the Up position. Your game is over(!) once you've done this trick.

Rage of the Dragons (c) 2002 Playmore Corp.

Rage of the Dragons is an original fighting game with 14 selectable fighters plus Abubo (sub-boss, hidden character) and Johann (final boss).

- TRIVIA -

Released in June 2002, Rage of the Dragons is the first fighting game developed by Evoga Entertainment. This game is a collaboration between Evoga (Mexico), Brezza Soft (Japan) and Noise Factory (Japan).

Evoga tried to make a new "Double Dragon" game and attempted to acquire the rights to "Double Dragon" from Technos Japan but they refused to sell. Without the proper rights to use the Double Dragon property, Evoga decided to do a game that pays homage to the Double Dragon series instead. For example, William 'Billy' Lewis, James 'Jimmy' Lewis and 'Abubo' are analogous to the characters Billy Lee, Jimmy Lee and Abobo from "Double Dragon". One funny thing about these Evoga characters is that they appear in Noise Factory's "Matrimeele", which is based on the Power Instinct series by Atlus.

Pupa Salgueiro &amp; Cassandra Murata are the only characters in the game that have two super moves instead of just one. These being the Ultimate Quexada (for Pupa) and a ground version of the White Wave (for Cassandra).

Linda, the famous lady with the whip in the Double Dragon games makes an appearance as one of Abubo's girlfriends in his intro pose as well as in the second Abubo cutscene.

Alice Carroll's name seems curiously inspired in the famous children's book "Alice in Wonderland" and by the name of its author Lewis Carroll. Odd...

Jones features many funny references to Bruce Lee such as his outfit (Bruce Lee's famous outfit in the 'Game of Death' movie), a few of his moves &amp; poses, and a suspicious quote in his ending!:)

The stage of Radel and Annie is a night club called 'Noise Factory' just as one of the 3 companies which worked on the game.

On the parking lot stage, there is a TV screen displaying credits for a movie. It contains Engrish text 'Special Sanks' instead of 'Special Thanks'.

Noise Factory released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Rage of the Dragons Original Arrange Album) on 13/09/2002.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Abubo: at the character select screen, press quickly Up(x4), Down(x3), Left(x2), Right. A little melody indicates that the cheat worked and Abubo should appear on center.

* The game encourages the use of team up attacks. In fact, by finishing each opponent with a team up attack will get you some nice grades &amp; a respectable score! (perfect lifebars with this tip will get you a handsome SSS grade every time!!!):)

* Jones' air version of his First Impact combo is broken against Alice since the last hit will always miss! Beware!:/

* Johann, the last boss in the game cannot be dizzied since he lacks a dizzy animation, this can be seen by performing a team up attack on him. This makes this already cheap boss even harder to defeat!:/

* After each battle, a rank is determined based on your fighting level. Here are the different levels and the bonus points awarded to the player if he reaches them:
SSS: 100,000 points
SS: 75,000 points
S: 50,000 points
A: 25,000 points
B: 10,000 points

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 36 years ago:

Rygar - Legendary Warrior (c) 1986 Tecmo.

Export release. Game developed in Japan. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese release entry; "Argos no Senshi - Legendary Warrior".

- TRIVIA -

Rygar was released in May 1986.

The differences between the US and Japanese (Argus no Senshi) are:
* The demo sequences are different.
* The Japanese version seems to have more hidden powers, stars and an extra free life.
* The US version is more biased towards stars and explosions.

- UPDATES -

The differences between the US (set 1) and US (set 2) are:
* 'Set 2' has a bug in the code which lets p2 start a game when p1 is already playing. You need to set a dip-switch to enable this behavior (it is usually on by default). If you press '2' while p1 is playing a single player game, 'Set 2' will check that you have 1 or more credit before it registers that you're now in a 2 player game, but it won't deduct the credit. That's a bad bug and probably accounts for why a bug-fix version was released.
* In 'Set 2', if p2 starts while p1 is already playing, it says 'playre2' instead of 'player2' at the top right.
* The first screen of 'Set 2' says 'ALL RIGHT RESERVED' - missing an 'S' - that's fixed in 'Set 1'

Strikers 1999 (c) 1999 Psikyo.

Year 1999, fall. The countless super minimum machine group 'nano-machine', which came flying, invaded the principal weapon and military terminals of each country from outer space and began multiplication. This weapon group which is automated with the 'nano-machines' repeated  attack with non discrimination and the metropoles of each country were in a devastating state. A fear of the extensive nuclear warfare with the strategy nuclear missile error morphism hit the world!!! Barely the unit of each country which prevents the invasion of the 'nano- machine' is summoned because of the unmanned weapon eradication  maneuvers. So, fighting with the weapons of the entire world was not enough. The Strikers start the attack on the enemy center! By the way of the time of half a century, new legend of special force STRIKERS now starts!

Strikers 1999 was released in October 1999 in Japan.

Export releases: This game is known outside Japan as Strikers 1945 III.

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to three smileys.

The Chaos Queen is the only boss in the game that is pure organic, unlike the others, which are robotics.

Scitron &amp; Art released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Strikers 1999 - SCDC-00004) on 21/01/2000.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Maintenance Code: in test mode, enter this code...
8-1-6-5-0 Maintenance Mode
0-1-9-9-9 Secret Command Enabled (X-36 is available by pressing 'Up' on random box).
8-1-6-3-0 Secret Random Enabled (X-36 is available on Random Box with luck).
8-1-6-2-0 Secret All Disabled (X-36 is not available).
8-1-6-1-0 All Data Erased.
1-2-3-4-5 Reset Scores.

* Technical Bonus: each boss, excluding the last one, has a weak point called 'the core' that is exposed outside for some few seconds. When the player airplane gets close to it at a fixed distance, it turns red. It is possible to defeat the boss quickly by attacking intensively the core at that point in time. The Technical Bonus is added if you destroy the core.

* Super Shot: when an enemy plane is shot the energy accumulates in the level gauge. When there's enough energy accumulated in the level gauge the super shot can be discharged by pressing continously the shot button. While the super shot is discharging the energy of the level gauge keeps decreasing. When energy becomes 0 the super shot stops being able to shoot. In Strikers 1945 III a cancellation function was attached to the super shot so the energy at the level gauge can be preserved.

Strikers 1945 Plus (c) 1999 Psikyo.

After inserting quarters and hitting the Start button, the player chooses one of 6 planes (plus 1 hidden plane) or can opt for a random choice.

The available fighters are:
* P-38 Lightning
* Vought XF5U 'Flying Pancake'
* Spitfire Mk. VI
* Zero Type 52
* Focke Wulf Ta 152
* Fiat G.56
* XP-55 Ascender (Hidden) 

The first 4 stages are in random order, while the last 4 are sequential. Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique 'supershot' which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a Bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds.

After the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level. All level are similar to the ones in Strikers 1945 II. Only one of the 4 bosses that are randomly chosen and the 6th boss is changed.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 27 years ago:

Pretty Soldier Sailormoon (c) 1995 Banpresto.

A 1 or 2-player sideways scrolling beat-em-up sees the Sailor Senshi fighting their way through five levels of anime-based combat. Each Sailor Soldier - chosen from a selection of 5, stiletto and mini skirt-wearing combatants - can punch, kick, jump, and throw their enemies; before finally reaching the traditional end-of-level boss.

As with Capcom's "Final Fight", and indeed many other games of the genre, items that aid the player are either dropped by beaten enemies or revealed after hitting certain obstacles and containers. Food can be used to replenish lost health and various trinkets can be picked up for bonus points. Finally, magic crystals can be found and are needed to activate the 'special attack' move. This works in a similar way to Sega's "Shinobi", with every enemy on the screen taking a hit.

Players must have at least one crystal to use the Special attack and up to 5 crystals can be carried at once. The more crystals the player holds when the special attack is utilized, the more effective it is against the game's enemies. Each level features its own unique, anime style animation. On level five, Sailor Soldier's signature attack move, from the original Japanese anime upon which the game is based, makes an appearance.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 36 years ago:

Salamander (c) 1986 Konami.

Salamander is a 1 or 2 player sequel to 1985's superb shoot-em-up, "Nemesis". While it retained the same basic gameplay and feel of its predecessor (particularly the superb and innovative weapons system), Salamander featured both superior graphics and a more imaginative approach to level design. The earliest example of the latter appears towards the end of the very first level, in which imposing, organic obstructions grow before the players' eyes. The game's third level - the infamous 'lava' level - is another good example of Salamander's superb design; with huge solar flares constantly erupting both above and below the player's ship that must be carefully navigated to avoid instant loss of life. Salamander introduced further variety to the action with the introduction vertically-scrolling levels, which alternated with the standard side-scrolling levels.

Salamander's weapon power-up system is as follows:
* SPEED UP: Five speed levels.
* MISSILE: Press missile button to launch.
* LASER: Your forward rockets turn into deadly lasers.
* RIPPLE LASER: Use shoot button to fire.
* FORCE FIELD: Protect your ship with barriers.
* MULTIPLE: Increase your fire power by up to four times.

Multiple special powers can be obtained, but the LASER cannot be used in conjunction with the RIPPLE Laser.

- TRIVIA -

Salamander was released in July 1986 in Japan. It is known in US as "Lifeforce", but it was re-released one year later in Japan as "Lifeforce [Model GX587]" (June 1987).

Salamander is the game that inspired Ikeda Tsunemoto (Toaplan&gt;Cave) to develop the 'Danmaku'; the shot patterns seen in "Donpachi" et al.

Note: The kanji on the Japanese version title screen actually reads 'Sa Ra Man Da', meaning 'Sand Gauze Wide Snake'. This is an example of 'ateji', where Japanese artists use the phonetic value of a character to fit the game's name allowing them to write the name in kanji as opposed to a kana.

The first boss in Salamander appears as BRAIN GOLEM in "Kyukyoku Sentai Dadandarn".

The story between the different versions of Salamander differs. While the story in the arcade original is not entirely clear, the Famicom version claims a large creature named Zelos (possibly the serpent often pictured on the game's cover art) is preparing to swallow your planet whole, and you must stop it from the inside out. The US arcade follows primarily the same story. the Japanese LifeForce may have a more surgery-related story, involving the removal of an unwanted virus or microbe from the body. The MSX version of Salamander differs the most from any of these. Basically, a prophecy from long ago comes true when an army attacks Latis and it's surrounding planets. They have created a barrier around Latis, and the only way to undo it is by activating a 'crush below' system created by ancient Latisians.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Bypass the mini-boss in stage 6: In stage 6 (Zelos's fortress if you're playing Salamander or the brain area if you're playing Life Force), there is a mini-boss section consisting of multiple boss ships that fire sets of 4 lasers. Move your ship all the way to the top of the screen and you will be safe until this section ends. This glitch does not work in the Japanese re-release version of the game (the one with a purple background in attract mode).

- TRIVIA -

Samurai Spirits Zero Special was released in April 2004 in Japan.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown V Special'.

The original version of the game contain some bugs and characters don't have fatalities. To correct that, SNK Playmore released corrected cartridges (without any problems) which can be recognized by a small NeoGeo sticker on the top right

On the game box, SNK put the following message: 'A final Farewell. To all of our customers, who have purchased NeoGeo rom cartridges up till now, thank you very much. We offer our most heartfelt gratitude for your loyal patronage over these 14 full years and hope for your continued support for our games on the many other platforms we will provide products for in the future. NeoGeo fans rule!'.

Some rumors says that SNK Playmore wanted to release an other upgrade of "Samurai Shodown V" on NeoGeo MVS called "Samurai Shodown V Special Final" including 2 new characters, some new stages and the correction of all the original game's bugs. A location test occurred in Tokyo in october 2004 but then SNK Playmore denied developing this game.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* I'm Not Afraid Of You!: think you are really good? Tap Start 3 times quickly to make your character drop his/her sword. Now show your opponents that the most fearsome weapons are the ones you were born with!

* The game has several last bosses: Amakusa,  Zankuro, Gao and Muzuki. In order to reach the latter bosses, you need to perform a fatality on the former ones. If you don't, you'll instead get a bad ending.

- TRIVIA -

Samurai Spirits was released in July 1993 in Japan.

The game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown'

Samurai Spirits is the first game that introduced weapon fighting into the fighting game genre. The game used an upgraded version of the scaling graphics engine that was originally featured in "Art of Fighting".

Samurai Spirits also started SNK's reputation for their unique style of Engrish, known as SNKgrish in their games.

Unlike "Mortal Kombat", the usage of blood in this game is generally accepted, and the decision to replace blood with 'white blood' remains a sore point among fans of this series.

Samurai Spirits is considered by some to portray Japanese culture and language effectively. Unlike most American versions of Japanese video games, the characters in this game (including the announcer) generally speak fluent Japanese with subtitles, and traditional Japanese music is often heard during gameplay. Samurai Shodown takes most of its characters from either historical sources or characters from the Ninja Scroll anime. In fact, a few designers that worked on Samurai Shodown also worked on the Ninja Scroll anime...

Haohmaru is based on the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645), whose fighting philosophy heavily influenced that of the Haohmaru character.

Ukyo Tachibana is Based on Sasaki Kojiro Genryu (1572-1612), Musashi's skilled rival.

Jubei Yagyu is based on the historical Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi (1606-1644), who was a sword instructor to the Tokugawa shogunate. The Yagyu clan was a famous clan of samurai.

Hattori Hanzo Masashige (1541-1596) was the most famous of the Iga Ninja clan. He was a genius at leading night raids on forts and fiefs and became a feared assassin. Under his leadership, Iga Ninja became so notorious that Nobunaga felt it necessary to obliterate the Iga Ninja clan.

Wan-Fu seems to be a combination of two famous Chinese warriors. The first is a famous Chinese swordsman who was a rebel during the Ch'ing Dynasty. His name was Wang Ts-bin Wu, but he became known as Da Dao Wang Wu ('Big Scimitar Wang Wu'). The second lead bases Wan Fu upon the ancient, almost legendary, founder of the Chou Dynasty, King Wu Wang.

Kyoshiro Senryo is based on Nemuri Kyoshiro, a fictional character created by Shibata Tosaburo. 'Kyoshiro' translates to something like 'deranged fellow'. Tosaburo's Kyoshiro had nothing to do with kabuki theater as does Samurai Shodown Kyoshiro. Kyoshiro's weapon is called a naginata.

Charlotte is based on a character in the manga 'The Rose of Versailles' by Riyoko Ikeda (1972).

Gen-an Shiranui looks much like Mushizo, the hunchback demon of Ninja Scroll. Gen-an's weapon is modeled after the weapon wielded by Shijima, the shadow demon, from Ninja Scroll. Although they share a surname, Gen-an is not a relative of Mai Shiranui of the Fatal Fury/King of Fighters series.

Amakusa Shiro Tokisada (1622-1638) led a Christian uprising against the Tokugawa shogunate in the Shimabara region of Japan.

Nakoruru is a homage to Sailor Moon.

A 'Kuroko' is a traditional Kabuki theater stagehand. They are traditionally dressed in black and took care of scenery and other behind-the-scenes needs during a Kabuki performance, just like modern theater stagehands. In the case of Samurai Shodown, Kuroko is the referee for each match in Samurai Shodown I and II. The black strip of fabric hanging over a Kuroko's face is to signify that they are not part of the Kabuki performance, just helping with the props. The red and white flags that Kuroko has are used in traditional martial arts matches, where each successful hit gets the corresponding fighter's flag raised.

Mai Shiranui (of Fatal Fury) appears in Haohmaru's and Gen-An's endings.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Samurai Spirits - PCCB-00135) on 17/09/1993.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Alternate Costume Colors: Highlight a fighter at the character selection screen and press D.

* Sleeping Mamahaha: This is just hilarious! To see this while playing as Nakoruru simply stand still, after a 8 secs or so Mamahaha will land on Nakoruru's shoulder, start yawning and then it will fall asleep!

* Poppy's Puppies: To see a truly cool &amp; funny secret pose with Galford, Get a PERFECT against an opponent while unarmed. You must finish the battle with anything except a throw though!

* Tam Tam's Broken Ending: If you use continues while beating the game with Tam Tam, you will miss a part of the whole ending (You can't see his real face). Beat the game with one credit in order to see his face.

* Wan-fu's Sword Explosion Bug: While playing as Wan-fu trap an enemy against the edge of the screen then perform the Explosive Sword Drop with the B button (HCB + B) to throw the sword and land next to the opponent. Since most players as well as the CPU are likely to block the move, crouch and hit them with the C button (a short kick). This will make the move unblockable and causes tons of damage!

* Cut-proof Characters?: Sometimes a finishing slash will cut most opponents in half, however some characters (these being Kyoshiro &amp; Amakusa) cannot be cut in half!

真 SAMURAI SPIRITS 覇王丸地獄変 (c) 1994 SNK Corporation.
(Shin Samurai Spirits - Haohmaru Jigoku Hen)

Shin Samurai Spirits is a one-on-one fighting game featuring 15 weapon-wielding combatants, fighting to earn the right to face the game's powerful and difficult end boss.

Building upon the success of the first game, SNK added several new characters and more moves. This is particularly evident in the addition of the POW meter, which acts as a super special-move meter. These moves not only cause severe damage to opponents but also break their weapons, forcing them to fight unarmed for a short time before a replacement weapon is issued.

Gameplay was further expanded to include several new movement options, including the ability to roll forwards and backwards, to duck to avoid high attacks, or to do small hops to avoid low strikes. This was also the first game to incorporate an offensive blocking technique, or 'parry'. Via a command issued at the last second, players can deflect an incoming attack and leave their adversary open to counter-attack. 

Shin Samurai Spirits featured cameo appearances from other SNK characters, as well as a hidden boss who would occasionally come out to challenge players.

Shin Samurai Spirits was released in October 1994.

The title of the game translates from Japanese as 'True Samurai Spirits - Haohmaru's Incident In Hell'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown II'.

Kafuin Nicotine (Anglicized as 'Caffiene') is based somewhat on the Ninja Scroll character Dakuan who shares outfit and is armed with similar weapons. The 'papers' that Nicotine throws are called 'o-fuda', which are talismans inscribed with a prayer to endow them with certain powers. Japanese occultism and lore at work.

Neinhalt Sieger's name translates from German as 'non-stop victory'.

Genjuro Kibagami is a huge reference to a Japanese hanafuda deck. Hanafuda is a Japanese card game in which all cards represent a certain flower and time of the year. The hanafuda cards can be seen when Genjuro hits his opponent with special moves. Among the cards seen are wistaria, maple and peony. All cards shown are from an actual hanafuda deck.

Ryuhaku Todo (of AOF) appears in Gen-An's ending.

If you wait a long time, Hikyaku will throw food and/or bombs to the screen. Every so often, Kim Kaphwan (of Fatal Fury) will come out instead.

Kuroko's moves are largely borrowed from other characters.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Shin Samurai Spirits - PCCB-00164) on 02/11/1994.

- TRIVIA -

Samurai Spirits - Zankurou Musouken was released in October 1995 in Japan. Literally 'Samurai Spirits - Zankuro's Matchless Sword'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown III' and in Korea as "Fighters Swords". The full US name for the game is "Samurai Shodown III - Blades of Blood".

Kafuin Gaira is a Buddhist monk whose weapons are giant 'mala', or Buddhist prayer beads. When Gaira wins the first round of a match, he throws a few punches and says 'Tenchu!', which means 'retribution!'. Gaira says a traditional Buddhist prayer for his fallen opponent when he wins the final round of the match. 'Namu amida butsu', Gaira's prayer, is basically 'go to heaven' or 'rest in peace'.

Shizumaru Hisame is a homage to Himura Kenshin (a character from the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin').

Zankuro Minazuki is a homage to Raijyuta Isurugi (another character from 'Rurouni Kenshin').

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 26 years ago:

Samurai Shodown IV - Amakusa's Revenge (c) 1996 SNK.

The 4th installment of the weapons-based one-on-one fighting series features seventeen selectable characters and two end bosses. Changes to the established formula include the removal of both aerial blocking and the switch-around move (the latter of which which allowed a player to move quickly behind their opponent's back). Dodges, which allowed players to evade/side-step attacks are also gone.

Players can no longer charge up their own POW gauge but a new move called the 'CD combo' was added; players can press the C and D buttons together, triggering a strike that can be followed up by a sequence of button taps.

SNK also added a "suicide" move, allowing a player to forfeit a round. The advantage to this is that the one committing suicide will start the next round with a full "POW" gauge. Certain finishes also enable a "fatality" move in the vein of "Mortal Kombat".

Some of the series' older characters were restored for the 4th game, including Charlotte, Tam Tam and Jubei Yagyu. The entire cast of the previous game also returns, although some have been redrawn to further enhance the cartoonish look.

Joining the cast are the two ninja brothers:

* Kazuki Kazama - member of the Kazama ninja clan specializing in fire jutsu, he deserts to rescue his younger sister, Hazuki, from Amakusa's clutches.
    
* Sogetsu Kazama - older brother to Kazuki and Hazuki who uses water jutsu; unlike Kazuki, he stays with the clan and is ordered to assassinate his brother for leaving.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown IV - Amakusa's Revenge'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Beat the entire game in the time limit to see a picture of Wan-Fu or Sieger after the end credits. Who appears is entirely at random though.

* In order to see a special win pose with the puppies, win with a double
perfect using Slash Galford. Galford will say, 'Arigato!' as the puppies
scamper across the screen.

* I'm Not Afraid Of You!: think you are really good? Tap START 3 times quickly to make your character drop his/her sword. Now show your opponents that the most fearsome weapons are the ones you were born with! Note: a few characters are really hampered by the loss of weapon (e.g. Haohmaru, Kazuki, Sogetsu) and a few are not really affected (Nakoruru, Rimururu, Hanzo).

* Sepukku (Suicide): press Back, then move your joystick a quarter circle from forwards to down and press START to make your character kill himself/herself and lose the current round (Useless trick? Not quite since you will start the next round with a full rage gauge!).

* Silly Name Trick: now this is weird! At the naming screen input 'AAA' as your name to make your character faint!

Samurai Spirits Zero (c) 2003 SNK Playmore.

A 5th episode of the Samurai Shodown saga on Neo-Geo with 24 selectable characters plus Poppy (secret character) plus 3 bosses (Sankuro the mid-boss, Yumeji the sub-boss and the general Gaoh as final boss).

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-270

Players: 2
Control: 8-way Joystick
Buttons: 4
=&gt; [A] Light attack, [B] Medium attack, [C] Kick/Break defence, [D] Lie down/Forward roll/Back roll/Small jump/Dodge

- TRIVIA -

Samurai Spirits Zero was released in October 2003 in Japan. Called ZERO because its story takes place before the first Samurai Spirits episode.

This game is known outside Japan as Samurai Shodown V.

Parts of Shiki's personality are homages to Rei Ayanami (a character from Evangelion) and Mugen no Jyuunin. As a matter of fact, one of her winquotes was taken word-for-word from a quote in Evangelion.

Rera first appeared in a Nakoruru OVA titled 'Nakoruru - Ano hito kara no okurimono'.

Sankuro's name and moves (which call out his henchmen), collectively, contain all the digits from one to nine.

Yumeji's attacks are all borrowed from other characters (for most of them, she morphs into the character she is borrowing the move from). Her Shin Musou Ittou-ryuu Kagerou and Shin Musou Ittou-ryuu Sasame Yuki - Sen are all borrowed from Ukyo's Bust moves in SS4 (Ukyo only has his Slash moves from SS4 in SS5). She also borrows: Charlotte's Bayonette Lunge, Genjuro's Sanren Satsu, Hanzo's Ninpou Mozu Otoshi, Haohmaru's Ougi - Kogetsu Zan, Jubei's Yagyu Shingan Tou - Souha, Kyoshiro's Choubi Jishi, Nakoruru's Annu Mutsube, Rimururu's Rupush Kamui Weison Pekoru, Ukyo's Hiken Tsubame Gaeshi, Yoshitora's Yon no Tachi - Tsubaki.

The creator of the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin', Nobuhiro Watsuki, helped to make 'Yoshitora Tokugawa'. Nobuhiro Watsuki has declared many times his love for the Samurai Spirits video-games. You can find some characters in his work strictly copied from these series.

Card game: In December 2006, Sabertooth Games released a Samurai Shodown V collectable card game set for it's Universal Fighting System (UFS) game.

- UPDATES -

If you put the game in 'Japan territory' via the MVS bios setting, the story mode will be completed by little scenes of dialogs between the different characters.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Costume Color Select: everyone has four outfit colors chosen by A, B, C or D. The (D) button ones seem to be the oddest ones.

* Play as Poppy: on the character select screen highlight 'Kazuki' and then move Left, Right, Left(x2), Right(x2), Left(x2), Right and then button A to select (use buttons B to D instead for different colors).

* I'm Not Afraid Of You!: think you are really good? Tap Start 3 times quickly to make your character drop his/her sword. Now show your opponents that the most fearsome weapons are the ones you were born with!

* Secret Win Pose: if you get a Perfect win in the second round with Galford, one of Poppy's puppies will show up and run forward, only to stumble and land on it's stomach.

* Pursuit Reset: pick Jubei and perform a Big Pursuit when unarmed (press Up+B+C when your opponent is down). The game will reset.

- TRIVIA -

Released in October 1985.

Considered by some to be the grandfather of all real-time video battle-games, Sarge was the first coin-op game to give players the ability to deploy multiple vehicles against common adversaries and, of course, each other.

Sarge is also probably the first real 'start-to-finish' design collaboration between artist/animator Brian Colin and programmer Jeff Nauman. 

From Brian Colin, Lead Artist on Sarge: "The realistically depicted female soldier featured in the game generated so much interest when it was first introduced that, part-way through it's production run, we slipped a hidden player incentive. With the machine's internal DIP switches set a certain way, players who achieved a rank of Colonel were greeted with a winking, sexy GI Jane wearing little more than a smile.
The DIP switches should be set as follows: 0011000100.
To see if the switches are set correctly, look at the girl at the start of the game. If she is wearing a low-cut T-shirt, then the 'hidden player incentive' is on.".

(Fu'un Mokushiroku - Kakutou Sousei)

10 fighters, each brandishing a weapon, fight to have a crack at the Real King Leo. There are 2 planes of action to switch from and in some cases the player can use elements of the background as weapons.

- TRIVIA -

Fu'un Mokushiroku was released on April 25, 1995 in Japan. The game was known outside Japan as Savage Reign (released one month later, on May 25, 1995).

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Wind and Cloud Apocalypse - Hand-to-Hand Fighting Genesis'). 'Mokushiroku' is Japanese for the Christian book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse. 'Sousei' is Japanese for 'creation of the world', or 'genesis'. 'Sousei' and 'Mokushiroku' are diametrically opposed, just like 'Genesis' and 'Apocalypse' - and used here as a metaphor for the conflict between Syo Hayate and Shishi-Oh (King Lion).

'Fu'un' in the series actually refers to the fighting style of the main character, Syo Hayate.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Fu'un Mokushiroku - Kakutou Sousei - PCCB-00181) on June 21, 1995.

- UPDATES -

In the Japanese version:
* King Lion is named Kage Shishioh.
* King Leo is named Shin Shishioh.

		<name>Space Chaser</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 43 years ago:

Space Chaser (c) 1979 Taito.

Space Chaser is a 2-Dimensional maze racing game. You control your rocket through the maze to pick up the dots while at the same time avoiding the rocket, or rockets, that are constantly trying to ram you. Successfully get through one maze and many more await you. This is good practice for freeway driving in the big city.

- TRIVIA -

Space Chaser was released in October 1979.

Also released as a cocktail model. In Japan, the cocktail version is known as "T.T Space Chaser".

This is probably the most manic of the "Head-on" type of games, as instead of a car (or 2) you're trying to avoid a head-on collision with, you have a missile trying to ram into you. This gives added pressure, since you must be able to outrace the missile at the end of the round.

Maybe also known as "Missile Chaser".

- SCORING -

Dots: 10 points X level number. 
Levels start at 1 and go up to 9. After that level 9 keeps repeating itself.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* How to finish off the first screen:
1) Let your rocket finish off the half of the bottom row you are on, but turn around before you turn the corner. Turn towards the center when you get back to where you were.
2) Finish off the ten sets of two dots in the middle. Watch out for the missile trying to strike you. Although you should have no problem with giving your rocket a moment's needed boost, try to do as much as possible without boosting through the center. You'll need it later.
3) Take the circle of dots that surrounds the inner area. 
4) Go to the bottom row. You should have the left half of the bottom line ready. Go around, finishing the dots.
5) On the last row, hit the boost. You'll need it to finish.

* Hold down 2P DOWN while it says INSERT COIN. Then insert a coin and play. You will have 2 extra ships.

* In the Hard difficulty setting, you normally start at level 4. Hold down the 1P START (the 1 key) while it says INSERT COIN. Then insert a coin and play. You will start at level 5.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 29 years ago:

Schmeiser Robo (c) 1993 Hot-B.

Schmeiser Robo plays similarly to other 2-D versus fighting games during its release, which the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. However, unlike most other fighting games released at the same time, the game uses an 8-way joystick and 3 buttons: one for punching, another for kicking, and the last one first introduced in the game during the modern era of fighting games, the guard button. Every character can do moving and attacking in spite of repeatedly pressing the guard button; however, they can't block their opponents' attacks by using it. Other unique features introduced in this game are quick (or small) jumping, air-guarding, counter-attacking, guard-canceling and rush-attacking.

		<name>Super Cobra</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 41 years ago:

Super Cobra (c) 1981 Konami.

The object of the game is to invade ten SUPER COBRA defense systems of increasing difficulty and safely pick up the BOOTY.

Use the joystick to move up, down, accelerate and decelerate. Use the Laser and Bombs to destroy defenders. Hitting tanks scores Mystery Value worth 100, 200, or 300 points. Rockets, Tanks, Missiles, and UFO's may all fire at invader. Hit fuel tanks for extra fuel for CHOPPER. The Chopper uses up fuel as it flies, except in between defense levels.

At 10000 points, the player is awarded a BONUS CHOPPER.

At the end of the game, the player can continue at the defense level he left off on by depositing extra coins and pressing the discharge button on the left-hand side of the panel.

If the Booty is destroyed on the BASE level, the player may try again. When the Booty is safely recovered, a Bonus Chopper is awarded and play resumes at defense level Number 1 where the fuel is used up faster and the defenders fire more often.

SUPER COBRA Defense Level Descriptions:
*  Fuel Tanks appear on every defense level.
*  Tanks appear and fire on all levels except level 8 where they do not fire.
Level 1 - Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.
Level 2 - Chopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain.
Level 3 - Smart Bombs flying in groups of four over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Level 4 - Single Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear but do not fire.
Level 5 - Chopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against Falling Mines.
Level 6 - Rapidly firing, Roving Tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Level 7 - Maneuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or three times with Laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of Chopper which explodes when hit five times with Laser. Rockets appear but do not fire.
Level 8 - Chopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFO's. Tanks and Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Level 9 - Chopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings.
Level 10 - Firing rockets in a Building Maze.
Base - Player must maneuver the Chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away.

- TRIVIA -

Super Cobra was released in March 1981 in Japan.

Super Cobra came out at the same time as "Scramble". While Scramble only went through five areas to the base, Super Cobra went through ten areas. Super Cobra also had more enemies to deal with besides the missiles such as gun batteries and sidewinder missiles. The premise, though, is the same. Penetrate the enemy defenses to make it to the base to pick up the booty. What do you have against all this defense, you have your Super Cobra of course. It will, though, require all of your skills as a pilot to be able to go the distance to get the booty. This game never gained the popularity of Scramble but it still remains a cult classic and actually seems to have had better staying power then Scramble. Perhaps the reason was because it was more of a challenge, who knows.

A Super Cobra unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* When you start the game, your helicopter will be at the left side of the screen. Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the right side and no slower then the left side. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick back and forth. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control. You will hit a clear area and a message will come up such as '1000 miles cleared', '2000 miles cleared', etc... until your reach the base.

1ST AREA:  This is a basic introductory area. It will allow you to get used to the controls while the threat level remains relatively low. The area is a mix of both mountainous and city.
a) Learn how to vary your speed and you can drop bombs with pinpoint precision. You can only have two bombs on the screen at any one time. You will have to go close to the surface to really make a difference. The biggest threat is the missiles that rise up to meet you.
b) Fuel is a very precious commodity in this game. Don't take a chance trying to bomb a fuel tank. It's better, if you have a flat section, to take out what's under your rocket, and strafe the rest of the way. This way, you ensure you can hit the fuel tank or tanks.
c) Watch the terrain. Sometimes you may be cruising when a mountain will appear suddenly requiring quick reflexes and space you may not have.
d) You also need to watch out for ground fire from the gun batteries. They tend to fire random shots and if you aren't careful, they will hit your helicopter.

2ND AREA: This area introduces you to the sidewinder missile. These missiles are unusual in the fact that they fire at an arc and come back down again. This means your helicopter can get hit two ways. Of course, if it misses your helicopter, it tends to sometimes be helpful by taking out other ground targets such as missiles and gun batteries. The terrain is mountainous.
a) Follow the same pattern as you did in the 1st Area. This time, you need to be wary of the sidewinder missiles.
b) As always, make sure you keep a high fuel level and watch out for those gun batteries.

3RD AREA: You get to deal with the red UFO's in this area. Also, the mountains will get steeper and create ''choke points'' at the top of the screen. Of course, you will have to contend with the UFO's coming through the other side. The terrain is mountainous.
a) The red UFO's aren't too difficult to deal with. They have a tendency to stop in pairs, then come at your helicopter. Again, it's easy to shoot them down.
b) The biggest threats are the 'choke points'. You usually will arrive at the same time as a UFO to see who's first over the mountain. This will require quick reflexes.
c) Even though no missiles come up at you, the gun batteries will still harass you.

4TH AREA: This is a continuation of the 3rd Area. Except this time the area you are flying in is significantly narrowed to a point where it seems like you are going through natural caverns. Use the same methods as the 3rd Area.

5TH AREA: You will have to deal with threats both from above and below in this area. There are missiles in the ceiling of the caverns that will drop down. Although missiles aren't firing from the ground, you still have to deal with gun batteries. The terrain is mountainous and caves.
a) You will have to be real careful in this area, the missiles in the ceiling are pretty concentrated. You will have to be able to speed up and slow down on a dime to avoid them or to shoot them.
b) Don't get too close to the ground since the terrain goes from mountains to canyons very quickly.
c) As already mentioned, get fuel and avoid ground fire.

6TH AREA: The main threat in this area is the fact the gun batteries now move. That's right, they track right along with your helicopter until they hit an obstacle. They travel equally well in the canyons as well as the mountains. This makes them especially dangerous since they are firing at the same time.
a) You will have to accelerate and decelerate frequently to 'fool' the moving gun batteries.
b) When you destroy ground targets, be selective in which ones you hit because if you hit targets in the path of the moving gun batteries, you just allow them to travel farther.

7TH AREA: This area is a little trickier since you now have fireballs coming at your helicopter. In addition, there is a green fireball that likes to track your helicopter and prevent your shots from gaining any distance. It takes seven shots to take out this fireball.  The terrain is mountainous.
a) You will be staying in the valleys most of the time in this area. This is a good time to shoot things up on the ground since again, the missiles won't fly up at your helicopter. Gun batteries, though, will continue to harass you.
b) Timing again is important in this area since there are hills in the valley you must cross over. Of course, the tops of these hills are exposed to the fireballs. Time it so that right after a fireball passes over a hill, accelerate and drop into the next valley. Then decelerate in preparation for the next hill.

8TH AREA: This is repeat of the 3rd area except this time you will be dealing with 'chains' of white UFO's.  Use the same tactics as the 3rd Area.

9TH AREA: This is a very short city area. Just watch out for sidewinder missiles.

10TH AREA: This is the area that will get most players. The movements have to be precise in the caves or you will end up part of the wall.
a) Learn quickly when to accelerate and decelerate within the caves. Right when you come to a ledge, push the joystick all the way back and start lining up for the next cave. Accelerate quickly through it, decelerate and repeat this pattern.
b) Don't worry about running out of fuel in the caves, there are plenty of fuel tanks to top your helicopter off. Plus, you will need all that fuel for not only navigating through the caves, but also the base since it doesn't have any fuel tanks.

BASE: This is the second hardest area that gets a lot of players. You have to be very precise in your movement. You will have to deal with gun batteries firing at you while you are trying to pick up the booty.
a) You will see the KONAMI sign atop one of the buildings. Once you see this, you need to decelerate rapidly and drop down quickly to the shorter building next to the base. Once you almost clear that building, you will have to rapidly decelerate, drop down, grab the booty, and rise quickly to avoid the building on the right.
b) If you fail to grab the booty on a pass, the screen will repeat itself until you either destroy the base or run out of rockets to use on it.

Once you have completed the Base, the action goes back to the 1st Area again. Things, however, will speed up. Fuel consumption is quicker and the enemies also are faster.

Scramble (c) 1981 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

Scramble is a sideways scrolling shoot-em-up in which a single player takes control of a spaceship and must try to fight through six different enemy-packed levels - destroying as many fuel tanks and ground intallations as possible - before reaching the enemy base and destroying it. 

Contact with any scenery, ground installations, enemy ships or projectyles results in an instant loss of life. The Scramble ship is armed with both a blaster and bombs. The blaster is forward-firing only while the bombs drop downwards to target ground-based enemy installations and to collect fuel from fuel dumps. 

The fuel dumps are of particular importance, as the player ship's fuel gauge constantly depletes as the player progresses through the game and the only way to re-fuel is by bombing the fuel tanks that are located on the ground throughout the levels. Fuel usage increases as the game progresses, until fuel usage actually outstrips the amount of fuel dumps available and the game becomes impossible. 

Scramble is rightly considered to be a classic and was the world's first ever 'multi-level' shoot-em-up.

- TECHNICAL -

The Scramble cabinet was the same basic cabinet design that Stern used for all its games. It featured a monitor that was set back at a 45 degree angle, and a very large marquee that was angled towards the player. Most cabinets have straight up and down marquees, so Stern ones are easy to spot. This title features rather primitive painted sideart that only uses two colours, but it makes up for it with the impressive comic-book style art on the control panel and monitor bezel.

The marquee has a roundish 'Scramble' logo, with some sort of space castle in the background. The control panel is aluminium, and it has a mostly yellow design, with game instructions and a red ball-top 8-Way leaf switch joystick mounted centrally. It has fire buttons on both sides of the panel, so it can be played either left handed or right handed. The industry later forgot about lefties altogether and went completely right handed. Most of these machines were uprights, but there were several cocktail units made as well.

- TRIVIA -

Scramble was released in February 1981 in Japan.

Sometimes unfairly referred to as a 'poor man's Defender', Scramble was not only the world's first multi-level shoot-em-up, it was also the first of its type to feature a re-fueling system. These innovations helped to ensure that Scramble was a well deserved commercial success for Konami. 

This game was the first title to use the 'Scramble Hardware', which was later used for "Super Cobra", "Lost Tomb", "The End" and a number of other titles. Many of these titles were actually bootlegs of other games, such as Namco's "Pac-Man". This was because Konami neglected to give Scramble ANY copy protection whatsoever; making it incredibly easy to run just about anything that used a Z80 processor, which, at the time, was pretty much every game out there. There were, of course, a lot of Bootleg copies of Scramble itself floating around, such as "Explorer" or "Strafe Bomb".

Scramble is considered the first in the "Gradius" series according to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance "Gradius Galaxies" intro sequence.

This game had a Bulgarian bootleg called "Memory Devices Facility".

A Scramble unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

- SCORING -

10 points per second of flying.

Missile on ground: 50 points
Missile in air: 80 points
UFO: 100 points
Fuel Tank: 150 points
Mystery Base: 100, 200, or 300 points
Main Base: 800 points

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

A) Always watch what passes below you as you fly, especially in Sectors One through Four.

B) Ignore the 10 points added to your score every second: you want to finish each round quickly, because running out of fuel is bad news.

Try also to hit as many fuel tanks as you can, even in preference to mystery bases. One hundred and fifty points plus fuel is more desirable than an average mystery score of 200 points.

C) When you fuel gets low, the rule is to ignore everything but speed survival, and getting more fuel.

D) In Sector One, fly close to the ground. Your object should be scoring points rather than precise maneuvering, so keep in mind just a few simple rules: 
1. Fly slowly only when you must to destroy a rich cluster of targets.
2. Release a couple of bombs just as you top each mountain, then descend quickly into the valley.
3. Once there, shoot any threatening rockets by slowing down for a second and using your laser. Descend to the lowest plateau at the earliest opportunity, shooting lasers constantly to clear your path of targets.
4. Rise with the terrain, using your laser against targets in the foothills, and go all the way up only when the next mountain forces you to.
5. After the last mountain, be prepared for the UFOs.

E) Through Sector Two, simply fly relatively low at medium speed, pressing LASER and BOMB constantly. The laser shots will take care of almost all the UFOs in your way. If one or two survive until you reach them, shift to full speed until you pass them, dodging vertically if necessary.

Try to time the release of your bombs so that they hit fuel tanks, compensating for your middling speed.

F) Don't try to stay alive among the fireballs. Staying below them makes sense for two reasons - you keep your jet, and you even have a chance to pick up some points from the sparse targets below.

As for making if from valley to valley, just go where the fireballs aren't. Fly quickly through each valley, then stop just before you leave shelter. Wait there until a fireball passes just over you; then chances are that you will have a second in which to duck swiftly over and into the next valley. You will find there is definitely a rhythm to it.

G) If you fly through the city too fast, you might not be able to react in time to a juicy cluster of targets or to a rocket rising in your path. Fly at medium speed, lasering and bombing for all you are worth, especially at rockets in front of you and fuel tanks beneath you.

When you fly over silos too deep for your bombs to penetrate, accelerate for a moment in case the rockets suddenly take off toward your underside.

Treat a low roof just as you would a Sector One valley; descend and laser the row of targets into oblivion. Be careful, though, when reascending; the rises here are much more abrupt than Sector One.

H) Without excellent vertical control, you will never make it through Sector Five. Blasting away the fuel tanks blocking your path is vital, but requires much less of your concentration than does piloting the jet through such a tortuous maze.

As soon as you emerge from a passageway, stop. Then move up or down, whichever you need, as far as you can until the screen catches up with you and pushes you forward. Keep the joystick to the left; while the screen propels you, you should have time to find just the right height for entering the next passage.

Once you are in the next passage, speed up right away, giving yourself a head start for the next cavern; you will have to stop once again when you enter it. The cycle requires concentration even once you know the rhythm.

Sometimes, you will enter a cavern at top left and need to leave it through a passage at bottom right, but fuel tanks will block the mouth of the passage, cluttering even the cavern floor. If you are worried about crashing into these tanks from above before you have a chance to laser them, just drop a couple of bombs at the right moment in your descent. The tanks will stand in your way no longer.

I) Once you know its secrets, the base may actually be slightly easier than Sector Five. To destroy the enemy octagon, all you have to do is gun your engine before you enter its canyon, then pull sharply down and back, and nose up to it. If you are on its level, fire your laser; if just above, drop a bomb. You will destroy the base.

You will also crash your own ship, but no matter: you will start the next round with a free replacement. Most players are afraid of crashing, so they fly too high for their bombs to have any hope of reaching the base. Eventually, they crash or run out of fuel.

J) By now, you have probably realized the one step essential to mastering SCRAMBLE; memorization. Since the pattern repeats itself every round, being prepared for upcoming opportunities and dangers is what the game is about.

くにおの熱血闘球伝説 (c) 1996 Technos Japan Corp.
(Kunio no Nekketsu Toukyuu Densetsu)

The popular game of Dodge Ball is a rather unique sport in which teams of three players try to knock each other out with the help of special moves and team attacks. In this game you take control of a team and must beat all other teams (you can even recruit the other team's leader after beating them!) in order to face the  current Dodge Ball champion and take the title. Features cool anime style graphics, catchy music &amp; great sound effects, plenty of moves at your disposal and a solid challenge level. Dodge Ball anyone?:)

- TRIVIA -

Literaly 'Kunio's Hotblooded Dodgeball Legend'.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Super Dodge Ball'.

This game runs on the Neo-Geo MVS but was never released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.

This is yet another game by Technos that features characters inspired by the River City Ransom manga. In the overhead map at the beginning of each match, all characters are drawn in a comical small body style, apparently as an homage of the famous NES games that featured the River City Ransom characters.

Kunio appears in "Renegade" / "Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun" as main characters.

After the release of this game, Technos Japan went bankrupt (December 15, 95). Since the licenses of Kunio-Kun and Dodge-Ball had a great values in the 90's, former Technos Japan staff established a new company.

- UPDATES -

The International versions of this game are almost identical to the Japanese version (no voice cuts as in the Magical Drop games), only the title screen is completely different &amp; the fact that Shinji's taunt is censored outside Japan (Instead of merely shaking his fist angrily at his opponents, Shinji gives them the middle finger!).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Characters turn VERY slowly in this game, this means that you can score free hits if you either run past them and smack them with the ball, or pass the ball to a teammate that has already been defeated!

* Beat the game without continuing to see a special screen after the credits with all the characters grouped together.

Sengoku 3 (c) 2001 SNK.

Sengoku 3 is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players that differs from other games in the genre due to the complexity of its chain-combo based combat system. Rather than being limited to that standard one attack button, one jump button and a life-draining special move, Sengoku's button set-up is more akin to a one-on-one fighting game, with a light attack, heavy attack and long-ranged attack button, all of which can be utilised to create combos. 

Rather than simply mashing the attack buttons to create combo attacks, each of the game's four playable characters has an arsenal of special moves using directional inputs. Each character also has a super bar and several super moves that use varying levels of energy from this bar.

Sengoku 3 also introduces throwing weapons to the series but rather than just picking up dropped items and using them immediately, the game allows players to stash ranged weapons (but only one type at a time) including shuriken, bombs and kunai. As well as hitting enemies from distance, these weapons can also be integrated into players' attack combos.

Each stage end with a boss fight and two of the game's end-of-level bosses, once defeated, can later be selected as playable characters for the final two stages. The game's four playable characters (and two bosses who can become playable) are:

* Kegatsura
A Ninja and the main character of Sengoku 3. He's slower and stronger than average. His first super move is a diagonal downward beam of energy from his sword. For his second super move, he energizes himself with electricity and dashes forwards, slicing anything in his path as he streaks across the screen. He can also use the classic ninja staple; the Izuna Drop. His ultimate move is a lightning spell. 

* Falcon
A Spanish Ninja adept at very long combos. His first super move is a flame projectile shaped like a phoenix. His second is a dashing move. If he connects with an enemy during the dash, he performs a quick combo ending with a powerful flaming sword uppercut. His ultimate is a fire spell. 

* Kurenai
A female Ninja, Kurenai is the fastest character but also the weakest. She has excellent combo potential and is good for keeping multiple enemies at bay. Her first special is a spinning tornado slash. Her second special involves her creating three duplicates and dashing in various directions, hitting anything in her vicinity. Her ultimate attack summons a bunch of kaede leaves that damage everything on screen. 

* Kongoh
Kongoh is the strongest and slowest character. His first super move involves him stunning his enemy and then throwing them. His second is merely him tossing his rod forward. His ultimate attack creates a rain of falling iron rods. 

* Byakki
Byakki is one of the bosses that joins the fight after the third mission. He summons a demon from the underworld during most of his attacks and his first super move makes the demon's claw rise from the ground, hitting any enemy near it multiple times. His second summons a demon who then slashes any enemies directly in front of it. In his ultimate attack, he summons the demon who then causes meteors to strike all the enemies on screen.

* Okuni
Okuni is the second boss who, when defeated, becomes playable, also after the third mission. She mainly focuses on long range attacks and her combos are somewhat lacking. Her first move is a simple projectile wind burst. Her second is an electric attack using her fan. Her ultimate attack is a tornado of flower petals.

Released in October 2001.

Developed by Noise Factory (their first game) for the original SNK Corp. (SNK's last official title).

Sony Music Entertainment / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Sengoku Densyo 2001 Original Soundtrack - SCDC-00102) on 18/07/2001.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play as Okuni and Byakki: Finish China (Easy), Italy (Hard), and Japan (Hard) - This tip was given on the original game flyer.

Sengoku 3's greatest asset is the sheer number attacking options available to players. There are numerous ways to start a combo, the most obvious of which is to simply walk up to an enemy and start hitting the light attack button, but at any time during a light attack combo you can interrupt with a heavy attack - a slower, more powerful attack that usually brings a weapon into the picture - and depending on how many light attacks you've already executed, the heavy attack will be different. 

You can usually use two or three heavy attacks in succession, with the last one typically ending the combo, but in the same chain you can also go back to light attacks after a heavy attack. If your timing is good, it's possible to 'juggle' an enemy as they fly away from you using various techniques, like dashing by double-tapping the forward button. 

Dashing into an enemy damages them slightly, knocks them away from your character and sets up a juggle opportunity, even if the enemy you dash into is already airborne. By using these methods in combination with good timing, you can keep combos going for 20-30 hits.

Street Fighter Alpha 2 was released in February 1996 in Europe and in March 1996 in the USA.

In these export releases: 
Nash is named Charlie.
Vega is named M. Bison. 
Gouki is named Akuma.
Shin Gouki is named Shin Akuma.
Satsui no Hadou ni Mezameta Ryu is named Evil Ryu.

In the original Japanese version, specific locations are displayed on the 'next stage' screen. All export versions just tell you which country the stage is in. Perhaps someone at Capcom USA was too lazy to translate the location-specific text (which is in Japanese) and just used the country name (which is in English). Below are the place names that were left out of the non-Japanese versions, translated into English...

- TRIVIA -

Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha was released in August 1996. 

This game is very similar to it's predecessor, "Street Fighter Zero 2". It is slightly enhanced, giving some of the characters a new move or two. There are also additional game modes added, such as 'Dramatic Battle' (2 vs. 1), 'Shin Akuma Mode' and 'Survival'.

- UPDATES -

Here is the list of all versions: 

960805
* Green Board [Japan] release.

960813
* Orange Board [South America] and Pink Board [Brazil] releases.

960826
* Grey Board [Asia] release.

Unlike most other CPS2 titles, this one never had a Blue Board release in the arcades.

ADDITIONAL NOTES: 

In the Green Board [Japan] release: 
* Charlie is called 'Nash' 
* M. Bison is called 'Vega' 
* Akuma is called 'Gouki' 
* Evil Ryu is called 'Satsui No Hadou Ni Mezameta Ryu' (translated as "Ryu in which the surge of the intent to kill has awakened")

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Two vs. One Battle: Hold LK+MK+HK and press Start at the start screen. 

* Fight Your Mid Boss: Win five rounds with a Super finish or Custom Combo finish, and don't lose a round before the sixth match.

* Fight Shin Akuma: Hold MK+MP and press Start at the start screen. 

* Survival Battle: Hold LP+MP+HP and press Start at the start screen. 

* SFII' Versions Of Ryu, Ken, Sagat, M. Bison, Dhalsim, Zangief: Highlight the character and press Start. 

* Evil Ryu: Highlight Ryu and press Start twice. 

* SFII Costume Chun Li, SFII' Chun Li: Highlight Chun Li and press Start once for SFII costume Chun Li, twice for SFII' Chun Li. 

* Choose A Win Pose: Hold Start + any attack button after winning a round to determine your win pose.

* Alternate Colors For Sakura: Highlight Sakura and press Start(x5). 

* Stage Select: Can only be done when a second player enters the game, therefore the message "Here Comes A New Challenger!!" must appear before returning to the select screen. On the select screen, highlight a character icon and hold Start for 2 seconds. Then choose your fighter. If you want the grassy Australia stage (the tall grass), hold Start on Sagat's icon for 2 seconds then select your character (do not let go of Start). To select the Venezuela stage (the waterfall), do the same steps you would do to select Australia, except hold Start on Charlie's icon instead of Sagat's.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 29 years ago:

Shadow Force - Henshin Ninja (c) 1993 Technos.

Shadow Force is a side-scrolling platform beat-em-up for one or two players, who choose to play as one of four Ninjas and must use all the means at their disposal to free the world from the grip of the evil Dr. Wong and his terrifying 'Theaser' organization.

Shadow Force has 6 buttons: 2 for punches (low and high) 2 for kicks (low and high) 1 for jumping and 1 for possessing an enemy. Additional attack moves can be utilised by moving the joystick up or down and pressing punch and kick buttons. It's also possible to combine punch and kick attacks to obtain different combos and while the enemies can do the same, the number and variation of their attacks is generally lower than those available to the players.

In addition to being able to possess nearby enemies, Shadow Force also features something else new to the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre; at the end of each stage players take part in a bonus round consisting of a one-on-one fight. 

Players can choose to start on any one of the first three stages and the game features 14 different possible endings.

- UPDATES -

The Japanese version is different from the US Version:
- The game's sequence in attract mode are different.
- During the attract mode, you can see the events that bring the Dr. Wong and his evil organization 'Theaser' to menace the world. In the US version this sequence has been cut.
- There's a characters description during the attract mode.
- You can use only 3 keys in the game: one for punch, one for kick and one for jump, to possess an enemy press A+B when your close to him, and press A+B+C to execute the special attack.
- The enemies are more easily to beat, even the bosses suffer much damage (so, the game is a little bit easier)
- The Bonus Stage after each stage has been cut on the Japanese version.
- The standard color of the Coyote character is different.

The US version has at usual the 'winners don't use drugs' logo during the attract mode.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* To possess an enemy, go close on him, then press the 6th button, now you can use that enemy like a playable character, and you can use his moves too! (a screen appears with a description of one of the enemy moves). For leave the enemy body and return to your normal character hero, press the same key. Try to control different enemies and have fun to switch on them!! Find what of them are most powerful and how you can take advantage of their moves! Remember that you can't possess a boss, and also you can't possess nobody if your lifebar is empty; also, when the enemy possessed dies, the player is still on action, but is lifebar remains empty.

* When you engage an enemy, you fight still versus one of them, and in that moment you can go back and forward on him without turn your shoulder on him, you can also execute a block when the enemy attack simply press the opposite direction on him. If you engage groups of enemies, you fight one enemy at once, while the others stay far of you waiting that you defeat the first enemy before they attack you.

* After you've beaten the last boss, Dr Wong will challenge you giving the chance of one last battle before you can terminate the game: this final battle is identical to the bonus stage, but you can choose one of the 4 boss to fight versus the other character boss controlled by CPU. This is the only moment on the game where you can control a boss. If you win this last battle you can see the real final of the game, if you lose you'll obtain a game over.

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 24 years ago:

Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad (c) 1998 SNK.

More of an update than a full-blown sequel, Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad picks up where the first game - released a year earlier - left off. Once again, one or two players face the might of a terrorist army who are threatening to destroy the world by launching a newly developed weapon-of-mass-destruction if their wishes - to be given absolute control of the newly-founded nation of Billberk - aren't granted.

Like many Neo Geo sequels, 2nd Squad doesn't particularly do anything the original didn't do. There are some improvements, however; graphics have been given a brush up and level design is a little more imaginative than that of the already impressive original.

		<name>Shock Troopers</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 25 years ago:

Shock Troopers (c) 1997 SNK.

Shock Troopers pits the players against a mighty terrorist group who are holding a girl hostage, in order to force her grandfather to surrender a powerful drug which will enable the terrorists to control the minds of the grandfather's soldiers and create a huge, unstoppable army.

Shock Troopers is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players that builds upon the foundations laid by Capcom's 1985 classic, "Commando (Capcom)" and also borrows heavily from Commando's sequel, '"Mercs". As well as enemy troops, players must contend with tanks, choppers and assorted military vehicles, and must also be careful to avoid any of the landmines that litter the levels. Extra weapons and health can be picked up from destroyed enemy vehicles, as well as being found in enemy supply crates. Shock Troopers is effectively three games in one as players can chose one of three different routes; each made up of different levels. The game also offers greater variety of gameplay than other of the genre; with levels having the players travel on the back of fast moving vehicles, climbing a rock face etc.

		<name>Satan's Hollow</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 41 years ago:

Satan's Hollow (c) 1981 Bally Midway.

Satan's Hollow is a 1- or a 2-player game. When playing this game, the Rocket Launcher is under YOUR control. YOU make it move back and forth across the screen to launch Rockets that will eliminate your attackers. These attackers are displayed in groups, called 'racks', across the top of the screen. The first rack is made up of a small number of attackers. The second rack is made up of a larger number of these attackers. And intermixed with the racks of attackers is a rack with only a single fire-breathing Devil's head. 

The attackers and the Devil's Head will try to wipe out your Rocket Launcher. If they do, you lose one player. In emergencies, you have a Shield which goes all around your Rocket Launcher for a short period of time. It is activated by pushing the Shield button on the control console. BUT BE CAREFUL!! This consumes a lot of power and will only last a VERY SHORT TIME! 

Each attacker eliminated will cause a Bridge Section to appear at the lower left corner of the screen EXCEPT: when there is already a Bridge Section there or when you have a Bridge Section in tow under your Rocket Launcher. Pick these Sections up with your Rocket Launcher and move them over to build a Bridge across the gorge at the right side of the screen leading into the land of SATAN. 

When you complete your Bridge into the land of SATAN, you can cross it and do battle with him. If you win you will be rewarded by increased fire power for your Rocket Launcher. If SATAN defeats you, you lose one player. 

As your skill level increases, the number of attackers is increased and the speed that the fire-breathing Devil's Head moves is increased also. 

Bonus Rocket Launchers are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each attacker has an assigned point value. 

The object of the game is to HAVE FUN while constantly improving your skills as you play, eliminating as many attackers as possible each time to get the highest score.

This game had a dedicated cabinet that was just plain evil. It is red with realistic demons on both the sideart and the marquee. Flames and a blacklight on the control panel area add to the cool factor. In fact, this machine is up there with "Tron" in the ranking for coolest looking game around. The game was controlled by means of a 2-way trigger stick that was red and sort of translucent. This is the same basic stick that was used for "Tron", it is just colored differently. No one makes this exact stick anymore, but any trigger stick would make a fine replacement.

- TRIVIA -

Satan's Hollow was designed and programmed by Arcade Engineering, who designed a slew of games for Midway before being bought out by them in 1985.

Satan's Hollow was released in 1982. The copyright date on the screen says 1981 but Jeff was still working on it when Brian was hired in the fall of 1982.

The game drew some criticism in the bible belt for its theme.

Some wiring harnesses are labeled 'Satan's Master' and others have 'Satan's Power' on the tag. These may have been pre-production titles for the game.

It seems like this game has copied its ideas from many other places. Check it out:
* Enemies going down and attacking your stock is similar to the ducks from "Carnival".
* The elaborate, mostly static background reminds of "Pleiads".
* The shield idea is used similarly to the shield in "Phoenix" (though you couldn't move when using it then, and it took longer to recharge).
* The diving enemy concept was used first in "Galaxian".
* The shot-increasing power-up concept originated in "Galaga".

A Satan's Hollow unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

- TRIVIA -

Released in March 1988 in Japan.

- UPDATES -

In the non-Japanese version (set 1 in MAME), the dipswitch for coin A corresponds to what is typically the left coin input, and dipswitch B corresponds to the right.
In the Japanese version (set 2 in MAME), the dipswitches are swapped, so that dipswitch B corresponds to the left coin, and A to the right. The 1st set also does not display the Japanese warning screen.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Double Bonus: When the big flying ship comes (the one in 4 pieces) that gives you one bonus for each player, fire repeatedly on the second piece before it is in place. If it is destroyed before it is in place, you will be given two bonuses per player instead of one.

* At the end of level 5: When you arrive to the final enemy, around the hand pointing up of the statue there are two hidden icons. You can fire up with the jeep (or diagonal with the chopper), and you will see that your shots gets stopped by something invisible. If you keep firing, finally two new icons will appear (of course you don't have to kill the final enemy). Take this icon, and you will have a bonus. The bonus depends on your rank. If you have the Eagle rank you will earn 500,000 bonus points. If you don't have it, then you will earn 100,000 bonus points and the Eagle rank.

		<name>Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 32 years ago:

Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom (c) 1990 Toaplan.

One or two players take on the roles of snowmen Nick and Tom as they battle a variety of monsters over fifty platform-based, single screen levels. 

The snowmen can throw snowballs at the enemies with the aim of encasing them completely in snow. The encased enemies can then be kicked in order to destroy them and this is achieved by standing next to the snowball and pressing the "kick out" button. This sends the giant snowball flying around the screen, killing any enemies that lay in its path. 

If players take too much time to complete a stage, an evil pumpkin head will appear and try to kill them. The pumpkin is invincible but can be stunned with snowballs. After a short time the evil pumpkin will spawn ghosts that can travel freely around the stage as they seek out Nick and Tom. These ghosts can't be killed or stunned, so the player's only hope is to avoid them while eliminating the remaining standard enemies, to move on to the next screen as soon as possible.

When players defeat an enemy, it may drop a coloured potion bottle. These can be picked up and act as power-ups:
* Yellow = Long shot
* Red = Speed up
* Blue = Bigger snowballs (encases monsters quicker)
* Green = Inflates the players like a balloon and lets them fly around the screen, killing any monsters they touch.

Every 10th level features a battle with a large end-of-level boss.

- TRIVIA -

Snow Bros. was released in April 1990. 

Like Taito's "Liquid Kids", Snow Bros. was licensed to Manchester's Ocean Software for conversion to both the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga home computers but, again like "Liquid Kids", Ocean decided that the game wouldn't perform well at retail and the game was cancelled. It has since been released, in its entirety, to the emulation community and is a fine conversion.

This game was released as a conversion kit only (often factory installed in a generic cabinet), so any such machine could be converted into a proper Snow Bros. machine. This title is JAMMA compatible (the circuit board for it is one of the smallest ever made, it is barely larger than a Nintendo Famicom cartridge). The marquee for this title shows a 'Snow Bros.' logo, with two snowmen, and a couple of cartoon enemies in the background - in keeping with the game's 'cute' theme.

Licensed to Romstar for USA distribution.

A bootleg of this game is known as "The Winter Bobble".

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Out Zone, Snow Bros. - PCCB-00044) on 21/10/1990.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Killing all the monsters on a level with a single snowball causes money bonuses, worth 10,000 points, to fall down, but sometimes a glowing cake bonus will appear instead. When the cake is collected, the game stops and four blue snowball creatures appear for a short time. If these enemies are killed, they each provide a letter: S,N,O or W. Collect all four of these letters for an extra life. The glowing cake can also appear at other times during the game.

* Hidden Functions: If the 'Invulnerability dip switch' is enabled, you are invulnerable but you may also 'Pause' the game with P2 Start and restart with P1 Start.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 36 years ago:

Solomon no Kagi (c) 1986 Tecmo.

Solomon no Kagi is a single player platform/puzzle game in which the wizard Dana is on a quest to retrieve Solomon's key and vanquish the demon hordes that have broken through into his world. To achieve this Dana must advance through the fifty rooms of 'Constellation Space', before finally reaching the magical key.

Dana is armed with a magic wand that can be used to both destroy and create granite blocks, while blocks situated directly above Dana's head can be destroyed by repeatedly jumping up into them until they shatter. The blocks act as platforms, as well as barriers to defend Dana from the numerous patrolling enemies. Each room contains a golden key, retrieving this automatically opens the room's exit door and players must then try to find/create a safe route past the constantly spawning demons to reach the exit and progress to the next room. 

Bonus Items - some hidden inside pre-existing granite blocks - are scattered throughout each room. Collecting these earns the player extra points. Power-ups can also be found, these appear as potion bottles with a flame emblazoned on them and a maximum of three can be carried at any one time. When a potion is used, Dana shoots a fireball which will move along the walls and platforms until it hits and kills the first demon it comes into contact with.

As well as bonus items and power-ups, each room also contains a hand-bell. When collected this triggers the release of a trapped fairy, the fairy will then slowly fly around the room and can be rescued for bonus points. An extra life is awarded for every ten fairies rescued.

The game's levels are based on Zodiac star constellations. The main levels are divided into groups of four - making a total of forty-eight standard rooms - with each group representing a separate constellation. In addition to the standard rooms, each constellation also has a secret bonus room that can only be accessed by finding the given constellation's 'Seal', which is located in the last room of each group. There are three further secret rooms - 'Page of Time', 'The Page of Space' and the 'Princess Room' - that are only accessible if the player has found the 'Hidden Seals of Solomon'.

The four room groups are:
1-4 Aries 5-8 Taurus 9-12 Gemini
13-16 Cancer 17-20 Leo 21-24 Scorpio
25-28 Libra 29-32 Virgo 33-36 Sagittarius

Sonic Wings 2 (c) 1994 Video System.

The first sequel to the superb vertically scrolling shoot-em-up "Sonic Wings", players once again take control of a Jet fighter aircraft and take to the skies to destroy enemy jets, boats, helicopters, gun emplacements and huge end-of-level bosses. The graphics are every bit as accomplished as those of the prequel and the game delivers a good level of challenge.

The end-of-level bosses change from game-to-game; a nice touch that adds variety to an already solid game.

Players can choose to play as any one of eight different fighter pilots, each of which pilots a different jet:
* American F-117A Nighthawk piloted by Robo-Keaton. 
* American A-10 Thunderbolt II piloted by Mao Mao. 
* Japanese Fighter-Support X piloted by Hien. 
* Japanese F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain Silver. 
* International F-14 Tomcat piloted by Cindy and Ellen. 
* International YF-23 Black Widow II piloted by Spanky. 
* French Rafale piloted by Steve. 
* British Sea Harrier FRS2 piloted by Bobby.

Sonic Wings 3 (c) 1995 Video System.

The third game in this excellent series adheres to the solid shoot-em-up template set down by its predecessors. The player takes on the role of a Jet Fighter aircraft pilot whose mission is to combat world terrorism. The object of the game is to fly from country to country and destroy all opposition around the world, before flying into outer space to combat the menace responsible for the terrorism. Each pilot has his own storyline that ties in with the game.

One enemy shot destroys the player's plane and releases a special power-up that the plane may have been carrying. If the player's final ship is destroyed, all power-ups and extra bombs are released and can be collected if the player chooses the 'continue' option, or if a second player is still active. However, on the final mission in Outer Space, the player is forced to start again at the beginning of the space mission, unless 2 players are active.

Sonic Wings now features an array of 10 selectable pilots:
American Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Robo-Keaton. 
American Northrop P-61 Black Widow piloted by the Blazers.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 42 years ago:

Spectar (c) 1980 Exidy.

Spectar, released by Exidy in 1980, is the follow-up of "Targ". Gameplay is apparently unchanged, you control a vehicle called Whummel into a 9x9 grid maze, chasing down, and being chased by, the alien invaders. Targs have evolved into the more dangerous Rammers, and Spectars appears more often, shooting at player's ship.

You use a 4-Way joystick to guide your vehicle in the maze, and a pushbutton to shoot at enemies. Up to 2 players can alternate in gameplay.

The most noticeable difference from his predecessors is that to complete a level you can now collect all the gems in the maze, in a "Pacman"-like game or destroy all of the Rammers (like in "Targ"). Rammers and Spectars continue to appear from flashing pods, so you cannot rest and plan your course easily, or you will be overwhelmed by the alien force.

Graphic is highly improved compared to his predecessor: The maze now has barricades that must be avoided or can be used as a shielding against the enemies, and has ten environment settings, changing from the 'square-block town' of Targ to a city, a forest, a lunar landscape and many more. The enemies too are smarter and faster, and the fact that they go on spawning from the pods makes the game a even more frenzy challenge.

Johnny &amp; Tom, two treasure seekers must save their friend Mary from the evil Mad Doctor and his army of goofy-dressed henchmen, as well as gather the map pieces in order to find the biggest treasure in the world at the same time!

Miracle Adventure was released on December 16, 1993 in Japan.

This game is known outside Japan as 'Spinmaster'.

Miracle Adventure is Data East's first game developed and released for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.

This game seems heavily inspired by Data East's classic game "Caveman Ninja" (the artwork style, some character's animations, as well as the weapon's power up styles are a little too similar!).

The Mad Doctor also appeared as the final boss in Data East's "Tumble Pop".

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Miracle Adventure. Tatakae Genshijin 3 - PCCB-00146) on February 18, 1994.

Sega Rally Championship (c) 1995 Sega.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the Sega "Model 2A" hardware.

Players: 2
Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 4

- TRIVIA -

Sega Rally Championship was released in January 1995 in Japan.

Originally a Model 1 game, this was near completion when Sega stopped making Model 1 boards, so production was shifted to Model 2 and the artwork was redone.

Thanks to the Model 2 hardware, Sega Rally Championship serves 300,000 polygons per second.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* New Informational View: Hold down Start and View when selecting a car to get an alternate view. There is no rear view mirror, a seconds clock appears in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen and a split time will be displayed based on the best time the machine has in memory. The digits are red if you are currently faster the best time.

* No Waiting To Get Into The Game: To skip waiting for the ten second timer, thus avoiding another player joining the game, simply insert your coins and hold down both the Start and View buttons. Instantly the select screen will appear. No waiting!

* Different Car Characteristics: To get different car capabilities (e.g. slides more easily), while selecting your car, shift 1st/2nd/3rd/4th and you will hear a WHOOOSH! sound, which means this code is enabled. The car will now handle differently, as you will soon see.

* Lakeside Course In Practice Mode: Completing the Championship course is not the only way to reach Lakeside. When choosing a course, select Mountain and enter the gearshifts 1&gt;2&gt;3&gt;N&gt;3 and then wait until the timer runs out. You will hear a WHOOOSH! sound which means the code was performed correctly.

In M. Bison's ending in the Export versions, Bison says 'Not even the 'Ancient One' dared to challenge me!'. In the original Japanese version, where he's known as Vega, he doesn't say anything like this.

Localizations liberties were taken with Cammy's and Fei-Long's endings in the Export versions of SSFII, changing their whole context.

Some of the voice samples of Cammy and Dee Jay were changed from the original version:
(Japanese version quote - Export version quote.)
* Cammy: 'Spiral Arrow' - 'Cannon Drill'
* Cammy: 'Cannon Spike' - 'Thrust Kick'
* Dee Jay: 'Slash' - 'Max Out'

In these Export versions, Gouki is named Akuma and all of Akuma's dialogue was removed instead of being translated. If Akuma wins a battle in SSF2 Turbo, he has no victory quotes.

Akuma's ending was all completely removed from the Export versions, with only a credit roll if you beat the game with him, along with pictures of his defeated opponents.

Some characters' endings are translated inaccurately.

		<name>Sunset Riders</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 31 years ago:

Sunset Riders (c) 1991 Konami.

Sunset Riders is a horizontally-scrolling platform shoot-em-up for up to four players set in America's Wild West. Four sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West, before a final showdown against the infamous Sir Richard de la Rose.

The action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with play sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo. Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. 

Power-ups and bonus items can be obtained by entering saloons or defeating certain sack-carrying bandits. The power-ups comes in the form of either a golden sheriff badge (that gives the player's weapon auto-fire) or a silver badge that gives the player a second gun (making it possible to shoot in two directions simultaneously). Both power-ups can be equipped at the same time. 

Other weapons that can be used by players include sticks of dynamite carried by female bandits that can be thrown back at the enemy before they explode and a mounted Gatling gun available only in the last stage. 

A bonus mini-game appears at the end of Stages 2 and 5 in which players must shoot at enemies from a first-person perspective before the timer runs out.

Sunset Riders features eight stages of play.

- TRIVIA -

Sunset Riders was released in September 1991. 

In the 90s, the official Italian importer for Konami was Elettronica Videogames. Managers of the Japanese company usually visited the foreign partner, bringing a lot of new games and prototypes with them. In one of this circumstances, they brought with them the European prototype of Sunset Riders. In this version, the Mexican character was named 'Hermano' (brother). During a funny moment, trying to say something humorous, the chief technician of the Italian firm proposed: "Why not calling him Cormano?". Cormano, in fact, is the little town near Milan where the importing company was located. 

King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Collection Vol.5 - KICA-7605) on September 26, 1992.

The US versions have the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When you wait too long and don't give joystick/button input, the game shows on screen joystick/button example on how to play.

When you're facing off against the first boss, Simon Greedwell, there's a way to fire at him without being hit by his own gunfire. First, all enemies popping out of the house windows need to be cleared away, and the barrel on the left side needs to knocked down, exposing one side of the boss (but make sure you aren't hit and killed by the falling barrel). Then, position your player underneath that side so that he's firing upwards with the left hand at the left side of the boss (this is easier to do if you're holding two guns). If you do this correctly, you'll be able to gun down the boss while his own ammo passes by you harmlessly without touching you.

On the 2nd stage, as you're heading towards the train station where the second boss is waiting, there's an enemy-manned wagon that appears where the occupants throw out at least two logs that you need to jump over, lest you be killed by them. If you can anticipate the appearance of this wagon, you can shoot at the wheel almost instantly upon its arrival to destroy the wagon before they even throw out a single log at you.

On the 4th stage where you face off against the Smith Brothers in the saloon, they throw heavy explosives in your direction, so you need to keep jumping on and off the chandelier and in other directions to avoid their weapons. (Freeing the bar girls will render you intangible for a few seconds.) Don't try to jump onto the platforms where the Smith Brothers are standing while they're still alive, as you can be killed instantly when touching them.

On the 5th stage, the boss, El Greco, carries a whip causing instant death, and a shield. To succeed in hitting him, you need to try and jump around to shoot him from behind, as well as shooting him whenever he jumps, and to do your best to avoid being hit by the whip.

On the final stage, when penetrating Richard Rose's fortress, you need to use the Gatling guns provided to blast your way through two large wooden gates. Just jump onto the stands where your player will automatically grab the gun, point the joystick in the right direction and fire. But be careful, as the Gatling gun's ammo can kill other players as well as the enemy themselves

Suiko Enbu (c) 1995 Data East.

In the foggy marshes of the Liang Shan Mountains, an army assembles... Outlaws of the Lost Dynasty. 11 Superheroes from the Orient in a struggle for power and conquest!

Data East's second attempt at a Versus fighting franchise after their Fighter's History series. 11 Superheroes gather in the marshes of the Liang Shan mountains in a struggle for power.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the "ST-V [Sega Titan Video Game System]" hardware
Cartridge ID: 610-0374-01

Players: Up to 2 simultaneously.
Control (per player): 8-way joystick
Buttons (per player): 6

- TRIVIA -

Suiko Enbu was released in March 1995.

'Suiko' is a reference to Suikoden, the Japanese name of an ancient Chinese novel. 'Enbu' means a military excercise.

The fighters in this game are inspired by the 108 outlaws from the Chinese classical novel "Water Margin" by Shi Naian.

This game is known as "Outlaws of the Lost Dynasty" in the U.S.

The names of the characters differ between versions. In the US version, they retain the names they had in the Water Margin novel. Japanese names listed on the left, US names listed on the right:

Shishin = Shi Jin
Rinchuu = Lin Chong
Kosanjou = Hu San Niang
Taisou = Dai Zong
Riki = Li Kui
Rochishin = Lu Zhi Shen
Kousonshu = Gong Shun Sheng
Bushou = Wu Song
Gen Shouji = Ruan Xiao Er
Gen Shougo = Ruan Xiao Wu
Gen Shoushichi = Ruan Xiao Qi
Chougai = Chao Gai

The U.S. version of the game has different voices for the characters, removes the spoken victory quote voices by the characters (in Japanese) and removes a secret sub boss character that the player faces during the game before facing the final boss of the game. The character is known as Huyan Zhuo in the Water Margin novel and fights on horseback wielding two clubs.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

To change the skin tone of a character, press and hold any button to confirm character selection, then as you hold the button, hold different directions on the joystick to select the skin color you want, then release button.

To enable a golden color scheme, you must play a match against another player, then select the same character in the following manner:

Have your opponent select his character (San Niang for example) with Weak Kick. Then you select San Niang with Weak Kick and you select her with the gold color scheme. Gong is the only exception, your opponent selects him with Weak Punch, and then you choose him with Weak Punch to select his gold color scheme.

Players can bounce off an opponent's projectile move by jumping on top of it and tapping down on the joystick to avoid getting pinned.

Most medium and heavy attacks that connect with the opponent will cause them to either lift themselves on the ground floating, knock or bounce themselves off the ground, spin around in the air for a few seconds, or be knocked against the wall. The character can be hit or thrown at any point while any of this happens.

The meter at the bottom of the screen is not a super meter, the game doesn't have any super or desperation moves. This is the weapon meter. The meter decreases as players hit blocking opponents with their weapon or they block weapon attacks. When the meter is empty, the weapon blows up and the character will be stunned and helpless.

You can throw away your weapon if you have one by hitting both the Heavy Punch and Heavy Kick button simultaneously. If the weapon hits, it will knock the opponent dizzy. Characters may gain a new move but others may lose some essential moves when throwing their weapon, so be careful.

Players can chain punches and kicks together in a "one-two attack" sequence when unarmed, in addition to dodging an opponent's weapon attack while blocking so that they can counter quickly.

		<name>Super Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Super Pac-Man (c) 1982 Namco.

Super Pac-Man is a 1- or 2-player game where you are in control of the legendary Pac-Man. As in the original "Pac-Man" game, the goal is to clear each maze, but this time, instead of dots, the maze consists of prizes which are locked away behind gates. There are two ways to access the prizes. You can eat the keys which open a particular gate, and not always the gate which is closest to that key. Or you can crash through the gate after you eat a Super Pill and become Super Pac-Man. You are not required to eat all of the keys in order to complete the stage. 

Four Power Pills are in maze and allow Pac-Man to turn the tables on the ghosts and eat them for a short time. When the ghosts begin to flash, time is running out and they will switch back, so beware. 

New in this game is the Super Pill. There are two Super Pills in the maze which allow Pac-Man to become Super Pac-Man for a limited period of time. While in Super form, Pac-Man can crash through the maze gates, fly over the ghosts and avoid being killed (or eat them when they're blue), and travel at super speed whenever the player presses and holds the Super Speed button. When the super power is about to run out, Pac-Man flashes white and then returns to his normal form. You can extend the duration of Super time by eating a regular Power Pill. The Super time will then be extended by the duration of the ghosts' blue time. 

Pac-Man loses one life whenever a ghost catches him when the ghost is not blue and Pac-Man is not in Super form. You start with a set number of lives ('Lives' dip switch), and bonus lives can be awarded to you as you reach or pass certain preselected point values ('Extra Lives' dip switch). 

The tunnel is a great way to put some space between you and any ghosts that are on your tail since they can only move half as fast as you when they are in it. In Super Pac-Man, the ghosts are also slowed down by travelling through the passage directly beneath the ghost pen.

Occasionally, a star will appear in the middle of the screen with a picture on the left, and a rotating picture on the right. You may eat the star at any time for bonus points, but if you manage to eat the star when the right picture matches the left one, you will receive a larger bonus. 

As the stages increases, the ghosts speed up their pursuit of Pac-Man and they stay blue for shorter and shorter periods of time after he eats a Power Pill until, in the high stages, they do not turn blue at all. 

Super Pac-Man also features bonus stages in Stage 3, Stage 7, and every fourth stage thereafter, where there are no ghosts, a time limit, and Pac-Man is in Super form throughout the stage. Your goal is to eat all of the prizes in the given time limit. As with gameplay on the regular levels, you don't need to eat all (or any) of the keys. You are awarded the remaining time in the counter as points for successfully eating everything. With each Bonus stage, the walls and gates change color. 

Super Pac-Man remains true to the intermission formula established in "Pac-Man". These intermissions are more like the simple humorous anecdotes found in the original game, than the episodic stories told by the intermissions in "Ms. Pac-Man" and "Jr. Pac-Man". Super Pac-Man features four intermissions: 

1) Pac-Man enters from the left side of the screen, followed closely by the ghosts. When Pac-Man exits the screen to the right, the ghosts stop. Super Pac-Man appears high up from the right and the ghosts helplessly watch as Super Pac-Man flies over their heads and exits to the left. This intermission is played after Stage 2. 

2) As a tribute to the first intermission from the original game, Pac-Man enters from the right, and is followed by what appears to be a super version of Blinky. After they exit to the left, a super Blinky reappears from the left in his blue form, and is now followed by an even larger version of Super Pac-Man. This intermission is played after Stage 6. 

3) Pac-Man enters from the left side of the screen, followed closely by the ghosts. Before Pac-Man makes it all the way to the right, he simply disappears, leaving the ghosts stunned and puzzled. As the ghosts look around for Pac-Man's whereabouts, Clyde looks up and notices the extremely large version of Super Pac-Man falling from the sky, instantly scaring all of the ghosts blue before this super-duper Pac-Man squashes them. This intermission is played after Stage 11, which is the third Bonus Stage. 

4) The extra-large Super Pac-Man enters from the left side of the screen, followed by a pack of 32 ghosts, 8 of each color. After exiting to the right, four scared (blue) super ghosts reappear from the right. Much to their misfortune, they are being chased by 32 normal-sized Pac-Men. This intermission is played after Stage 16 and every 4th stage thereafter. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

* Pac-Man - Once again, you control the little yellow hero as you guide him through the maze and onto victory. Pac-Man's goal is to gobble up every target item. He must avoid contact with the ghosts unless they are blue as a result of Pac-Man eating a Power Pill, or when Pac-Man is in Super form as a result of eating a Super Pill. Unlike the other classic Pac-games, Pac-Man does not move any slower when he's eating targets than when he isn't. True to the other Pac-games, however, he is still capable of turning around corners faster than the ghosts, so make as many turns as possible when the ghosts are on his tail.

* Super Pac-Man - After eating a Super Pill, Pac-Man becomes large and in charge. In Super form, he can eat through gates without the use of a key, fly over ghosts without colliding with them (the ghosts actually change in appearance, becoming squat or thin depending on the direction they are moving; this ability does not prevent Super Pac-Man from eating blue ghosts), moving faster when the Super Speed button is held down, and extending the duration of his super power by eating a normal Power Pill. When Pac-Man's Super power is about to expire, he flashes white just like the ghosts do when they are about to change back to normal. 

* Ghosts - Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde are back. Basically, they behave the same. Blinky follows you more closely than any of the other ghosts, shadowing your trail, Pinky tries to stay one step ahead of you by second-guessing which way you will go and trapping you, Inky usually turns away if you take him head on, and Clyde does his own thing for the most part. In this game, their behavior is a tad more random than in the first game, so patterns cannot be relied upon. Also new in Super Pac-Man, they will exhibit a "stutter" behavior from time to time where they seem to shake in one spot briefly before continuing on. This can sometimes save you if you are being chased, or it can mess you up if you are following behind a ghost too closely. 

* Scared Ghosts - As in the original game, if Pac-Man eats a Power Pill, the ghosts will turn blue for a short period of time. The higher the stage, the shorter that time becomes, until the ghosts don't turn blue at all (but they do change direction). Eating ghosts scores big points (see Scoring below), but watch out when they start flashing because they're about to change back to their normal state. 

* Power Pills - A carry-over from the original "Pac-Man" game. These four large white blinking dots in the corners of the maze allow Pac-Man to temporarily chase and eat the ghosts until they begin to flash and turn back to normal. In this game, eating a Power Pill while in Super form extends Super time into the ghosts' blue time. 

* Super Pills - These two green pills grow and shrink in size close to the middle of the maze. When Pac-Man eats one of these, he grows to Super size and gains the power to crash through barriers, fly over ghosts, and use Super Speed. 

* Keys - The ultimate prize in the original game becomes an integral tool in this game. Eat the keys to open the gates that block your access to the prizes. You don't have to eat all of the keys to complete the stage. The maze contains 15 keys in all. 

* Gates - The doors that block Pac-Man from eating the prizes he needs to eat in order to complete the stage. There are 37 gates in all. 

* Prizes - Unlike in the original game, where you had to eat dots and collect the prizes for bonus points, you must eat all of prizes to complete the stage. The maze contains 31 prizes in all. 

* Bonus Star - Once Pac-Man has eaten a total of 15 items in the maze (including power pills and super pills, but not including keys), a bonus star will appear with one picture to the left, and a rapidly changing picture to the right. Eat the star for bonus points, or try to eat the star when the pictures match for an even higher bonus. Try to eat the star when the pictures on either side match and are the same as the current stage's main prize (for example, apples in Stage 1) to score the maximum possible bonus points.

* Tunnel - By going through one end of the tunnel, Pac-Man and the ghosts can cross over to the other side of the screen. Any ghost who goes through the tunnel will move at half speed. This speed decrease also occurs under the ghost pen now.

- TRIVIA -

Super Pac-Man was released in October 1982 in Japan. 

In this new Pac-Man game, the gameplay mechanics have altered radically - instead of eating dots, the player is required to eat a key, which unlocks a section of the maze containing some kind of food. Once all the food is eaten, the player advances to the next level. The new game-play mechanics were considered by many to be confusing, and too much of a change from the first two games ("Pac-Man" and "Ms. Pac-Man"). Ultimately, Super Pac-Man proved to be the least successful game in the original series, being outsold that year by "Pac-Man Plus", a slightly updated version of the original game. In spite of this, the game's A.I. was celebrated as being one of the best of that era, and in the eyes of many fans, was the best out of any Pac-Man game. 

The alien spaceship "Galaxian" makes an appearance in this game as the main prize of Stage 15 (the fourth Bonus Stage). 

A Super Pac-Man unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Try to group the ghosts together, and lure as many as possible at once behind you before collecting a Power Pill.

* Note that in this game, you can kill the ghosts in their home, so on the early stages you can kill all four, then collect another power pill and kill them in their base as soon as they regenerate. This gives you another few seconds breathing space as well. This is generally not recommended unless Pac-Man is in Super form at the time.

* At the early parts of each level, concentrate on picking up as many keys as possible before collecting any prizes. This way you open up a lot of the maze, saving grief later on. 

* When you are in Super form, collecting a normal Power Pill extends your Super time. The Super Pill does last longer than a normal Power Pill. 

* When you are in Super form, try and break through any remaining doors to save you from having to collect all the keys. 

* Don't worry about the bonus star in the center - it's not worth wasting time waiting to try and match the items as you score far more points in general play on later levels. 

* Although the maze layout is always the same, the keys on later levels open different doors, so you can't rely on the same patterns on each screen. 

* All stages whose numbers are one less than a multiple of 4 (Stage 3, Stage 7, Stage 11, etc.) serve as Bonus Stages. In these stages, Pac-Man is Super-sized throughout the entire stage, and there are no ghosts. These are the stages to take full advantage of the Super Speed button. Complete each Bonus Stage before time runs out; the remaining time is awarded to you as points.

* Easter Egg: 
1) Enter service mode. 
2) Keep Button 1 pressed and enter the following sequence: Right, Down(x2), Left(x4), Up.

		<name>Vs. Super Mario Bros.</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 36 years ago:

Vs. Super Mario Bros. (c) 1986 Nintendo.

Classic and cult horizontal platform game featuring the Nintendo mascot Mario who must save princess Toadstool (Princess Peach in Japan) from Bowser (Koopa in Japan).

- TECHNICAL -

Vs. Super Mario Bros. is most common in a converted "Donkey Kong" or "Donkey Kong Junior" cabinet (this game was only available as a kit, there were no dedicated cabinets made). Actually, any copy of this game that is not in a converted Donkey Kong series cabinet is incorrect (as the Vs. kit was only designed for those cabinets). Nintendo designed a special small joystick for their Vs. Unisystem games (allowing a 2 player setup on the tiny Donkey Kong control panel). Another difference between this title and most standard games was audio that was processed in the monitor (although this was the same as most other early Nintendo titles). One other notable thing about this title is that either joystick will control either player (most Vs. titles were like this), making it rather pointless to have 2 sticks in the first place.

- TRIVIA -

Vs. Super Mario Bros. was released in February 1986 in the USA.

Basically, this is the arcade port of the Nintendo Famicom "Super Mario Bros.". There are slight differences:
* Item placement in the '?' and hidden blocks differs slightly, so if you're used to the Playchoice-10 version you may find a few different and unexpected items in certain familiar places.
* Parts of levels were also changed slightly, too, the most noticeable being a gap in the ceiling bricks on the way to the Warp Zone in World 1-2.
* This seems to make the World -1 trick impossible to do on Vs. Super Mario Bros., as it involved the use of these removed bricks.
* More enemies added in most levels
* Bug fixes / preventions.

This game is also known as "Vs. Mario's Adventure".

A hack of this game where made by Two-Bits Score and is known as "Skate Kid Bros.".

Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on Apr. 24th, 2009.

A Vs. Super Mario Bros. unit appears in the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men'; Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Increase The Number Of Marios By 100 Or More: There is a way of increasing the number of Marios by more than 100. At the end of World 3-1, when Koopa Troopa comes on the block stairway just before the flagpole... and reaches the lowest step, jump on him to make him stop moving.

* The 999 Timer Bonus Trick: This one can be done on any of the -4 Worlds. It is most difficult to achieve on World 6-4 and World 7-4. What you do is try to end the level with the timer at 000, and the machine will act as though you have 1000 units of time instead of 0. It will drop to 999 and count down to 000 from there and award points for each unit of time. Simply jump to the axe as the timer goes from 002 to 001 and you should finish the screen with the timer at 000 and get the maximum bonus.

In 2002, as soon as they changed to develop console games, they became a subsidiary of Cavia. After 3 years, they changed their company name to Feelplus. In 2011, they decided to merge with AQ Interative (former Cavia).

After Dantel is defeated, two Hitler heads in blue are seen in the ending.

		<name>SNK vs. Capcom - SVC Chaos</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 19 years ago:

SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom (c) 2003 Playmore Corp.

A one-on-one fighting game - the collaboration between Capcom and SNK - pits seventeen well-known SNK combatants against seventeen of Capcom's most famous game characters.

'SVC Chaos' primarily utilizes the command system of the "King of Fighters" series, incorporating light/strong kicks, punches, cancels and charging attacks. Unlike its predecessor, however, "Capcom vs. SNK 2", SvC features no air guards and lacks a 'groove system', instead focusing on quicker game play and online competition.

Each character is equipped with a basic three-bar system for executing 'Exceeds' (special attacks), with basic filling options attributed to strikes and damage. Additionally, the sprites from the various series received new models and some special effects were changed in the command lists (For example, the player can no longer increase the damage of the 'Zujou Sashi' used by Choi Bounge by tapping the buttons).

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.

Released in July 2003.

Here are the 17 SNK characters (plus Evil Mr Karate) and their first appearance in video games:
Athena Asamiya - "Athena"
Choi Bounge - "The King of Fighters '94"
Earthquake - "Samurai Shodown" ("Samurai Spirits" in Japan)
Iori Yagami - "The King of Fighters '95"
Kasumi Todoh - "Art of Fighting 3 - The Path of the Warrior" ("Ryuuko no Ken Gaiden" in Japan)

Kyo Kusanagi - "The King of Fighters '94"
Geese Howard - "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" ("Garou Densetsu - Shukumei no Tatakai" in Japan)
Genjyuro Kibagami - "Samurai Shodown II" ("Samurai Spirits II" in Japan)
Goenitz - "The King of Fighters '96"
Mai Shiranui - "Fatal Fury 2" ("Garou Densetsu 2 - Arata-Naru Tatakai" in Japan)
Mars People - "Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001"
Mr Karate - "Art of Fighting 2" ("Ryuuko no Ken 2" in Japan) as Takuma Takazaki
Orochi Iori - "The King of Fighters '97"
Ryo Sakazaki - "Art of Fighting" ("Ryuuko no Ken" in Japan)
Shiki - "Samurai Shodown 64" ("Samurai Spirits 64" in Japan)
Terry Bogard - "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" ("Garou Densetsu - Shukumei no Tatakai" in Japan)

There are also 17 Capcom characters (plus Shin Akuma) and here are their first appearances:
Akuma (Gouki in Japan) - "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" ("Super Street Fighter II X" in Japan)
Balrog (M. Bison in Japan) - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Chun-Li - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Dan Hibiki - "Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams" ("Street Fighter Zero" in Japan)
Demitri -  "Darkstalkers - The Night Warriors" ("Vampire - The Night Warriors" in Japan)
Dhalsim - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Guile - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Hugo - "Final Fight"
Ken Masters - "Street Fighter"
M. Bison (Vega in Japan) - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Red Arremer - "Ghosts'n Goblins"
Ryu - "Street Fighter"
Sagat - "Street Fighter"
Tessa - "Red Earth" ("Warzard" in Japan)
Vega (Balrog in Japan) - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"
Violent Ken - "Street Fighter Alpha 3" ("Street Fighter Zero 3" in Japan)
Zero - "Mega Man X" ("Rockman X" in Japan)

The super bar is called the 'Groove Power Gauge'; a reference to "Capcom Vs. SNK 2 - Mark of the Millenium 2001".

Bao (from the King of Fighters series) makes a cameo in a few of Hugo's pre-battle and win poses.

The Athena that features in SVC Chaos is the original Athena character design that featured in the character's debut platform game, "Athena", instead of the usual Asimaya Athena that appears in virtually every other SNK game. Notably, a lot of her moves are now very different, and she wears noticeably less clothes due to the fact Athena loses her dress during Athena's intro. Athena's fighting moves are inspired by the manga/anime 'Saint Seiya'.

The 'Sennou Ken' character is based on the psycho-controlled Ken in the SF animated movie. A lot of Mars People's moves are references to numerous UFO-based staples; Independence is a reference to the movie 'Independence Day', for example.

The 'Dan Hibiki' character is once again used as a vehicle for numerous genre parodies. If you perform his super-taunt he parodies Joe Higashi and Yuri Sakazaki's taunts. Also, two of his new moves are parodies of the Kyokugen moves. In the first of these moves, Dan attempts to do one of the larger fireballs performed in one Ryo's desperation move, but it has the same range as his regular fireball. On the second move, Dan attempts to perform his own powerful punch similar to Ryo's Exceed move, but after the move charges and connects Dan grabs his arm in pain and then pretends it was nothing.

While using Demitri, if you perform Midnight Bliss on Orochi Iori, Iori will turn into Miss X (from SNK Gal Fighters on the Neo Geo Pocket) as he's choking him.

Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game on November 2003.

*Fight Goenitz or Dan Hibiki: Fail to meet either of the above requirements.

Also your opponent on Stage 6 determines who you will fight in Stages 7 and 8.

* Fight Orochi Iori (Stage 7) and Serious Mr. Karate (Stage 8): Stage 6 opponent is a Capcom character.

* Fight Violent Ken (Stage 7) and Shin Akuma (Stage 8): Stage 6 opponent is an SNK character.

* Fight Athena: Don't lose any rounds during Stages 1 through 7, Don't win any rounds by block damage.

* Mid-Bosses: your performance in Stages 1 through 3 affects who you will fight in Stage 4.

* Final Bosses: your performance in Stages 1 through 7 affects if you'll fight either Athena or Red Arremer (in Stage 9) after beating Stage 8 (Shin Akuma or Serious Mr. Karate). Your performance in Stage 8 will not affect any of these conditions.

* See character's true/good ending: Defeat Athena or Red Arremer in Stage 9. If you lose to Athena or Red Arremer then you cannot continue. Many characters (such as Dan and Demitri) have different endings for beating either Athena or Red Arremer.

* CPU Character Patterns: before you start the game the CPU randomly picks one of the predetermined patterns of opponents. This affects stages 1 through 3 and 5 &amp; 6. Stage 4 is the predetermined mid-boss. Here are the predetermined pattern of fighters.
Pattern 1: Kim, Dhalsim, Mai, Bison, Kyo
Pattern 2: Vega, Earthquake, Chun-Li, Choi, Ryo
Pattern 3: Shiki, Balrog, Kasumi, Sagat, Iori
Pattern 4: Guile, Genjyuro, Tessa, Kim, Ken
Pattern 5: Tessa, Sagat, Mr. Karate, Chun-Li, Ryo
Pattern 6: Chun-Li, Kasumi, Hugo, Mr. Karate, Guile
Pattern 7: Mr. Karate, Hugo, Shiki, Dhalsim, Terry
Pattern 8: Choi, Mai, Vega, Genjyuro, Akuma
Pattern 9: Kasumi, Chun-Li, Shiki, Tessa, Mai
Pattern 10: Earthquake, Vega, Akuma, Ken, Ryu
Pattern 11: Dhalsim, Hugo, Kyo, Balrog, Iori
Pattern 12: Iori, Guile, Bison, Kim, Ken
Pattern 13: Ryu, Balrog, Kim, Sagat, Ryo
Pattern 14: Terry, Choi, Earthquake, Genjyuro, Guile
Pattern 15: Kyo, Ken, Ryo, Ryu, Terry
Pattern 16: Balrog, Vega, Sagat, Bison, Akuma

So let's say the CPU randomly chooses Pattern 16 (which interesting enough follows the boss pattern of Street Fighter II plus Akuma), you would fight Balrog, Vega, and Sagat in stages 1 through 3, fight the mid-boss in stage 4, fight Bison and Akuma in stages 5 through 6, and then fight Orochi Iori and Serious Mr. Karate in stages 7 through 8 (since the stage 6 opponent was a Capcom character).

Tapper (c) 1983 Bally Midway.

Taking on the role of an overworked bartender, the player must serve beer to the ever-thirsty patrons that populate his bar. All customers must be served before they work their way up to the beer kegs. Empty glasses must also be collected before they slide off the end of the bar and smash to the floor. Extra points are awarded for collecting tips, while bonus rounds involve locating the one beer that has not been shaken, and serving it. The game features four different levels:
1. Cowboys
2. Athletes
3. Punk Rockers
4. Aliens

- TRIVIA -

Tapper was released in December 1983 in the USA.

There were two other versions of Tapper: "Root Beer" (January 1984) and "Suntory" (Japan, Game ID: 834-5385 / 834-5387). The Suntory version was a Sega board, Suntory is a Japanese beer (see "Updates" section for more information).

The main character in the game (as well as the main character of two other Bally Midway games; "Domino Man", and "Timber") is based on a Marvin Glass employee called Mike Ferris, who had the same distinctive mustache and bald head and reputedly wore a red T-shirt all of the time.

The music for the third stage (the punk bar) was loosely inspired by new wave music group Devo's song 'Workin' in the Coal Mine'.

Tapper was play tested in a Chicago-area Rush Streetbar called 'The Snuggery' and received much positive feedback from the bar's patrons. Digitized belches were originally going to be used in the game, but, perhaps thankfully, they never made it into the final version.

The cabinet is designed to resemble a real bar - replete with a brass foot rail and two brass drink or ashtray holders (one on each side of the control panel). The cabinet and gameplay on the beer version features the Budweiser logo. The pour spouts have mock-up Budweiser handles that closely resemble the Budweiser taps that appear in real bars throughout the world.

Approximately 3300 Tapper uprights were made and around the first 100 or so were released with colour side art. About 300 cocktail machines were also made.

The main character appears on the 2012 Disney animated movie Wreck-It Ralph, during the Bar scene. It should also be noted that despite the game in the movie being Root Beer Tapper, the main character wore his outfit from the Budweiser version.

- UPDATES -

* Suntory version has different graphics and most likely different music.

- SCORING -

Serving a cowboy/girl patron with beer: 50 points.
Serving a sports bar patron with beer: 75 points.
Serving a punk patron with beer: 100 points.
Serving an alien patron with beer: 150 points.
Collecting an empty beer glass: 100 points.
Collecting a tip left on the bar: 1,500 points.
Guessing the correct can on the bonus screen: 3,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Easter Egg: In the attract mode, wait until the word Tapper is filling up with beer, and hold down the joystick, both taps, and the player 1 &amp; 2 buttons. You will then see the names of the game designers.

* Take your time in the first few levels. You can make a high score by leaving one person and waiting for more people.

* The last guy in the row will almost always leave a tip.

* If a person leaves the bar in the first level you get 50 points but, if you let them get close to the end of the bar, they will drink the beer and stay. It's 100 for getting the empty mug.

* The longer you stay in the level, the faster the people and mugs move.

Targ (c) 1980 Exidy.

Targ is a 1 or 2-player shooter game released by Exidy in 1980. Your town is invaded by Targ riders, you must maneuver the heroic vehicle Wummel to destroy them. From time to time, a Spectar comes into screen, and can be destroyed for extra bonus.

Action takes place into a 9x9 grid, 'Crystal City', where the player's vehicle must avoid and chase down 10 enemy wedge-shaped vehicles. When all enemies are destroyed, you are awarded an extra bonus and can access the following level. 2 players can alternate in the game. You use a 4-way joystick to control the Wummel, and a pushbutton to fire at enemies. Progressing in the gameplay causes the Targs to become faster and smarter, for a fast and furious gameplay.

Main CPU: MOS Technology M6502 (@ 705.562 Khz)
Sound Chips: DAC

Control: 4-way joystick

- TRIVIA -

Targ was released in June 1980. It was the first 'fantasy theme' game.

While in that period many western companies licensed games from Japanese developers (Exidy itself licensed Nintendo's "Sheriff" as "Bandido"), Targ is one of the few western games that made it in the opposite way, being licensed by Sega for Japanese distribution.

Targ stands for 'Target'. 'Spectar' stands for 'Special Target'.

- SCORING -

Scoring in this game is pretty easy although it is done a bit differently. You will be given the score value of a Targ Ramship at the beginning of each level. This is how you can figure out which level you are currently on.
Targ Ramship: 10 points x level
Spectar Smuggler: 100-900 points (by 100's)

You also get a bonus for completing a level. The bonus is 1000 points x level number.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When you start the game, your Wummel will be in the bottom right corner of the screen. There will be 10 Targ Ramships at the top of the 10 vertical lanes.

* Learn how your Wummel operates. You can go pretty fast in one direction. To turn around, though, takes a little time since you have to slow down before you turn around. You can use this deceleration, though, to your advantage to trap enemy units and sometimes get multiple kills.

* You can only have one missile on the screen at any one time. Plan your shots accordingly. In addition, you can only fire forward.

* All enemies on the screen will avoid trying to be in front of your Wummel. That means you must quickly get in front or behind them so they don't veer off to avoid your fire. This means you may have to plan a few ambushes to take out the enemies.

* All the enemies (Targ Ramships and Spectral Smugglers) only move at full speed. This can work to your advantage since if they are coming at you, you can decelerate your Wummel and pick them off.

* If you must turn around quickly, the easiest (and best) way to achieve this is to go around the blocks.  Three right turns can turn you from the hunted into the hunter. In addition, this is great for setting up ambushes and taking out the enemy ships quickly.

* Try to isolate enemy ships. If you try to take on a ''pack'' of them, you will lose since there are so many different directions that the enemy ships can come from.

* During the first three levels, you have enough speed to avoid your attackers. This changes on level four and beyond as the enemy ships can easily outrun your Wummel. This means you will need to make very quick turns in order to get behind them.

* Also, if you take too long on a level, the enemy ships will speed up to make quick work of your Wummel.

* As you progress through the levels, the enemy ships will get ''smarter'' and attempt to corner your Wummel. Your safest action is to avoid being trapped while picking off individual enemy ships to even the odds.

* Nifty little trivia note: The game screen is an optical illusion. If you stare at the yellow boxes, you will see yellow circles form at the intersections. Nothing that affects game play but still interesting.

Tempest (c) 1981 Atari.

Tempest is a classic into-the-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a claw-shaped "Blaster" ship that moves around the outer rim of a three-dimensional, wireframe tunnel. Enemies move down the tunnel towards the player's Blaster ship and must be destroyed. Any contact with either incoming enemy fire or the enemies themselves will cost the player a life. Completion of a tunnel will see the player warp through "hyperspace" to the next tunnel to tackle a new wave of enemies. 

The tunnels are each rendered in one of sixteen different geometric shapes. Enemies increase in number as the game progresses and if an enemy reaches the outer rim occupied by the player's Blaster ship, it will chase and attempt to kill the player. Rim enemies can be killed, but this is difficult to achieve. 

Some enemies also drag "spikes" - in the form of lines in the middle of the corridor - behind them as they travel up the tunnel towards the player. These spikes must be avoided during the "hyperspace" warp sequence at the end of the level, as contact results in the loss of a life. 

Two "SuperZappers" are available per level. The first SuperZapper kills all enemies on the playfield at the time of firing, while the second randomly kills only one enemy on the playfield. The SuperZapper does not affect enemy shots, spikes or enemies that have not yet landed on the playfield. 

One new feature Tempest introduces is "Skill-Step". This allows players to start a new game on the same level as was previously reached (although the new game must be restarted within thirty seconds) without having to replay previous levels. This allows skillful players to continue being challenged, while less experienced players can try to master higher levels. The 99 skill levels of play includes sixteen different playfields and seven different enemy targets. 

* The tubes are divided into cosmic corridors through which the aliens travel, although some aliens such as Pulsars and Flippers can move from one corridor to the next. Regardless of the tube shapes, aliens always begin their invasion from the small, distant end of the tube. The sixteen unique tube shapes are as follows: 

1. Circle 
2. Square 
3. Plus symbol 
4. Bow-tie 
5. Stylized Cross 
6. Triangle 
7. Clover 
8. V 
9. Steps 
10. U 
11. Completely Flat 
12. Heart 
13. Star 
14. W 
15. Fan 
16. Infinity Symbol (figure 8 on its side) 

The playfield's color scheme changes every sixteen levels. In addition, other events also cause playfield color variation. The SuperZapper causes the playfield to flash as enemies are zapped. Playfield rails flash rainbow colors when a player earns a bonus life and Pulsar enemies cause sections of the nearest rim to disappear and - during the pulse phase - adjacent rails to flash.

- TRIVIA -

Tempest was released in October 1981 at the price of $2,295. 25,113 Upright units were produced. Tempest sold approximately 20,000 units to distributors before it was even released. 

Tempest was an awesome arcade game that transported the player into abstract realms of space. It is still the favorite of devotees who seek to become one with this adventure through hyperspace. 

Tempest was the first game to use 'Color-Quadrascan' and 'Skill-Step', both features unique to Atari vector games. The design of Tempest stemmed from an idea that Theurer had for a 3-D "Space Invaders" clone, but was changed when it was decided that the game wasn't very original or fun.

The first prototype of the game had the shape wireframe spinning and the gunner remaining stationary, but that caused motion sickness after a period of time so it was changed around.

The game's name started as 'Aliens', then was changed to 'Vortex' (a name Theurer likened to a 'feminine hygiene product'). The final name was decided on just before production started. 

* The Creation of Tempest: Dave Theurer, who designed the game and wrote the software, said his original intention was to make a first-person perspective of the "Space Invaders" game, but he ended up doing something completely new and different. 

Rich Adam: "Dave implemented a first-person "Space Invaders". Everybody played it but they didn't keep coming back. You could tell when you had something cool, the engineers kept coming back. This was good and bad because there were times when you wanted to work on your game and everybody would want to be playing it. But when he was doing the first-person "Space Invaders", Dave didn't run into this problem of everyone wanting to play the game...and he said to himself: 'Well, maybe this isn't working. What can I do?' Then I came in one day and all of a sudden he had this round tube with these things coming up it. I said, 'What the heck is that Dave?' He said, 'I don't know. Aliens from the center of the Earth? I don't know.' I think he said something about having had a dream about it. I said, 'How does it work?' He said, 'I don't know. They're coming up around the edge of this thing and you're trying to blow them away.' He just sort of started out with this concept and took it from there. I can see why he would say that Tempest was certainly his proudest achievement. He worked extremely hard on that. It's pure creation from his own brain.". 

* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters: Although known for his hard work and for his ability to focus on and conquer exceedingly tough software problems, Dave Theurer looks back upon his days at Atari as having been fun and rewarding. 

Dave Theurer: "It was just so exciting working on these new games. All my life I loved explosions. When I went to college I was a chemistry major because I wanted to do something where I could make explosions. When I was a kid I had a chemistry set and I'd blow stuff up all the time. Eventually, you learn that you can't really do that in real life, so the next best thing is to do it on the screen, so here I was blowing stuff up on the screen. Simulating real life is fun too. It's almost like you can create your own universe. Well, you are creating your own universe. That's rewarding, to see something come alive.". 

Playing games, both video and pinball, was a constant part of life for the engineers at Atari. 

Dan Pliskin: "In the morning, I used to go in and I'd make up a pot of Italian roast or French roast coffee and pour myself a big mug. Then I'd go and sit it on a pinball machine and drink coffee and play pinball until scores got up to, like, a couple hundred thousand. That would be my indication that I was sharp enough to go and design something.". 

* Popular from the Start: Tempest was a game that immediately captivated people from the very start. 

Lyle Rains: "Like a number of these games that were very addictive, the Tempest controls were good enough to where once you learned how to manipulate them you could almost become one with the machine. That is, a good Tempest player gets to spin that knob and do the firing in the right time and get into sync with the machine or get into a rhythm. I don't know exactly what to call it, but you were so close to the action that part of you entered the experience. You forgot about what was going on around you and you were just there. And you could get very good at it. I think what people like is the ability to accomplish amazing things". 

* The Great 25-Cent Escape: Not only did players often find a sense of welcome escape in the video games they played, but this was very much the intention of some of the great game designers. 

Dave Theurer: "I want to design it for a guy who's totally frazzled by his job and needs a way to temporarily escape. There's a certain class of games...where you just get into a trance when you're playing them. As long as you're in this trance you'll do fine." 

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including TEMPEST. 

A Tempest unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Twilight Zone - The Movie', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet', in the 1986 movie 'Running Scared', in the 1986 movie 'Maximum Overdrive' (A cocktail cabinet) and in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'. 

A Tempest unit appears in the music video 'Subdivisions' by RUSH. 

In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including: "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

NOTE: The bonus points are rewarded only once per game, when you complete your starting level.

At the beginning of the game, you can always start on levels 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Whenever you complete a game, you have either ten seconds or until you press a key to continue a game. You can start a game at any bonus level below where you finished your last game. Therefore you must end your previous game on level 12 or higher to start your next game on level 11. 

If you fail to clear the starting level you have chosen, that level is not available for you in the next game. However, all starting levels below it are available. For instance, if you start a game on level 17 but do not finish, then your next game can start as high as level 15.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Hints: 
- Continue playing until you destroy all aliens or until all the aliens reach the rim of your universe. If you have a Blaster, you advance to the next level of play. 
- Players should work their way up through the levels to become familiar with game play. Drop down a level if play is too difficult. 
- Experienced players should start at highest level possible for maximum points. 
- On a new playfield shoot at enemy dots at far rim. 
- Try to shoot aliens while they are still in the corridors of the cosmic tube. They pose a greater threat (and are harder to hit) once they reach the rim of your universe. 
- Shoot a Flipper as soon as it starts to flip. Anticipate where they are heading and fire your Blaster in that direction.
- Once a Flipper reaches the rim, you can shoot it only by waiting for it to flip into initial contact with your Blaster. But you must fire before it takes the next step and flips on top of your Blaster.
- Tankers carry other aliens. To destroy their cargo, move your Blaster back and forth across adjacent corridors as you fire.
- Fuseballs spend most of their time along the edges of the corridors, out of firing range. To make sure you hit them, move your Blaster from one side of a corridor to the other while you fire. Once they reach the rim, you can only destroy them with your SuperZapper. 
- Use long Spikes to reclaim shots and kill enemies approaching you from adjacent lanes. 
- Avoid shooting Fuseball Tankers near the top since emerging fuseballs usually zip up to the top and kill you. 
- When Pulsars contract into a zigzag bolt of lightning, quickly move your Blaster away from their corridor. 
- Fire at Pulsars after they fire, but before they get ready to fire again. Pulsars and Fuseballs are like Flippers in their ability to switch corridors.
- Watch for corridors that are open along the rim. You can still move your Blaster over the gaps, but beware...there is a Pulsar inside. 
- Don't fire at missiles. They are dangerous and you don't get points for destroying them. 
- Avoid spikes. At the end of a level, position your Blaster over a corridor that is free from spikes. During higher levels of play, blast away at the Spikers and their spikes to keep a safe corridor for your next hyperspace passage. Remember, you can't destroy them with just one shot.
- Use the SuperZapper right before last enemy reaches the top for a few extra points. 

* 898,000 points bonus: 
1) You must have the Revision 1 ROMs in your machine. 
2) You must have your machine set to coins and not on free-play. 
3) Start a game and play until you successfully clear Level 24 (red V). Die. 
4) Start a new game on the Level 24 and complete the stage to get a bonus taking your score to more than 160,000. 
5) As soon as you get the bonus from clearing Level 24, get the last two digits of your score to 46 (by shooting spikes). Die. 
6) Wait! Wait for one cycle of the machine's attract mode - high score initials, TEMPEST attract, game demonstration, high score table. 
7) Start a new game, spin the spinner to the right all the way up to Level 81 (green circle). 
8) Complete the stage for a bonus of 898,000. 

* These are cheats. (They weren't cheats at all. They were intentionally programmed in as a security measure.) They were removed in ROM 217 and 222 software revision 2. First, you must complete Level 8 (blue V) and get a score with the format XXYYZZ: XX must be greater than 16, YY between 29 and 60, ZZ is a code listed below... 
00 - freeze screen 
01 - access bookkeeping totals 
05 - allows playing during attract mode 
06 - 40 free credits 
11 - 40 free credits 
12 - 40 free credits 
14 - credit sound without actual credit 
15 - credit sound without actual credit 
16 - 40 free credits 
17 - 40 free credits 
18 - 40 free credits 
41 - switch last 2 digits of score 
42 - increase score quickly 
46 - demonstration mode - start at any level, up to level 81 
50 - player moves by itself 
51 - player moves by itself 
60 - objects drift down 
66 - objects drift right 
67 - objects jump 
68 - objects drift up 
70 - objects drift up 

After code '05' (play during attract mode) is activated, the following cheats become available... 
Set the last two digits to 46: Random-colored level with wrong enemies. 
Set the last two digits to 48: 255 extra lives. 

These are tips for anyone new to Tempest: 

Note: Level colors mentioned below refer to the level's tunnel color.

1) Flippers first appear in Level 1 (blue circle), but don't start flipping until Level 2 (blue square). Flippers flip at a constant rate, so play the angles. You can kill Flippers on the outer edge by shooting when they are in the spaces next to you (as they flip). The wider the angle, the more time you have to shoot. You can also move under Flippers as they flip. Good practice is to play Level 1 as long as possible without firing. On the open shapes, you will want to hang out on one end of the other (to avoid attacks from both directions). On closed shapes, pick a spot with good angles and good visibility. Often flipping back and forth between two spaces (playing the angles depending on which direction the flippers are attacking from) is all you have to do. 

2) Tankers first appear in Level 3 (blue plus). Regular Tankers contain two Flippers. Feel free to shoot them and their cargo with impunity. Fuseball tankers are VERY dangerous. Shoot them and get out of the way. Pulsar tankers are also very dangerous. Shoot them and stay where you are (the Pulsars will appear to either side). You can differentiate between the types of tankers by looking closely at their centers. Fuseball and Pulsar Tankers have tiny pictures of their cargos in their centers. The ability to instantly differentiate between tanker types is probably the most important ability separating good Tempest players from great Tempest players. 

3) Spikers first appear in Level 4 (blue bowtie). Spikers are generally harmless (although they do shoot at you), and the spikes they lay down are very handy some times. You can hold the fire button down for continuous fire, but you only get a maximum of eight shots at a time. This is enough to fill half the tube, but not enough for a true continuous stream of shots. If you have lots of flippers coming after you, find a long spike to sit on top of. You can then hold down the fire button for a machine gun effect. As the spike gets eaten away, look for another one to switch to. Be careful of pulsars and fuseballs when you do this however. When you get to level 65 (black/invisible circle) try riding a full spike all the way down at the end of the round. Your descent rate and rate of fire are perfectly matched so that you can actually blast it away without being impaled all the way to the bottom. 

4) Fuseballs first appear in Level 11 (blue flat/bowling alley). Fuseballs ride the lines. The safest place to be is in the space NEXT to one. It looks like it will kill you, but the hit logic only tests the center of the fuseball. Fuseballs will only cross one space at a time before dropping back down (until the end of the round when they start chasing you). If you get stuck with one coming after you at the end of a round (usually on one of the open shapes), try the 'Hail Mary' move of spinning very quickly. You can actually jump over one or more spaces (and a fuseball!) if you spin fast enough. Watch out for fuseball tankers at higher levels that split into two fuseballs that will immediately try and jump on you. 

5) Pulsars first appear in Level 17 (red circle). Pulsars are only dangerous when they are pulsing. Listen to the low, periodic buzz sound. As you get used to it, you will find yourself adapting to this built-in rhythm. You can shoot them when they aren't pulsing or spin out of the way. Watch out for pulsar tankers at higher levels that split into two pulsars on either side of the tanker lane. 

6) Dip Switch #2 (2nd from the back of the game) on the upper bank (at N13) controls demo mode. Demo mode lets you start (and practice) anywhere you like. It does not record scores, however. In normal play, the game will let you start close to where you left off. If you want to 'cheat', put the game into demo mode, spin up to where you want to start, start the game and hit the 1P Start button causing you to zoom down the tube and gain the bonus. Then die and flip the dip switch back to normal mode. Now you can start a real game at the same level and record your score at the end. If you do this often, wiring a front-mounted bypass to that dip switch will come in very handy. There is also a freeze game dip switch that is also handy in case the phone rings while you are playing. 

7) Level 81 (green circle) is the highest starting level. Most expert Tempest players agree that green is actually easier than the black/invisible levels that precede it. It is a bit faster, but it restores one of the most valuable visual clues in the game - the tell tale break in the outer edge caused by a pulsar (which is missing in the black/invisible levels). After level 96 (green figure eight/infinity), you are back to the green circle (97) and green square (98). Level 99 is the highest recorded by the game and consists of a never ending supply of random green shapes. Every time you finish the round or lose a life, you will end up with a different shape. To achieve a world record score, you will spend MOST of your time playing level 99 over and over again. If you can keep your rate of loss to roughly one life per two rounds (at 20K bonus), you can theoretically play forever. Tempest isn't a very good marathon game, however, as it only lets you build up 5 lives max at any one time. A 30-second bladder break while playing level 99 will pretty much wipe you out. 

8) The highest score recordable by the game is 999,999 (a horrible error on the part of the designers). Starting at Level 81, you get there pretty fast (mid way through the greens). With a bit of practice, you can end the game at exactly 999,999. Do that 3 times and no one will ever be able to beat your score on a single machine (w/o clearing the high score table).

Terra Cresta (c) 1985 Nichibutsu.

Terra Cresta is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set over a scrolling landscape of islands and enemy installations. The player pilots the 'Wing Galibur' and is under constant attack from enemy spaceship waves, ground-based guns and turrets, dinosaurs and three up to different mothercraft ships.

Ground-based silos bearing numbers appear at regular intervals, these can be shot to release a ship upgrade component, which then attaches to the player's current ship, increasing both its size and firepower. Every numbered component the following abilities:

1 (Alpha): This is the Wing Galibur, the default craft and the fleet’s lead ship. It fires twin projectiles from the front.

2 (Beta): This doubles both the Galibur’s firepower and its size. 

3 (Gamma): Ship number three gives the Galibur tail guns, enabling it to shoot behind as well as in front.

4 (Delta): The fourth ship provides a concussive beam that tears through smaller enemies and inflicts greater damage on larger enemies.

5 (Epsilon): The fifth ship generates a force field behind the Galibur, protecting it from attacks from the rear.

Using the 'Formation' button splits the ship components into a wide formation for limited time, giving increased fire power. The number of parts acquired determines the formation. For example, if the player has picked up two ship parts then a triangle is formed, with the player's main ship at the rear of the formation. During this, the components are invulnerable to all enemy fire, while Wing Galibur itself is not and if the Galibur itself is hit, the player will lose a life

When all four numbered parts have been collected, the player's ship transforms into a firey Phoenix and is indestructible for a limited time.

As odd as it may sound, this is one of the very few game that lets you use melee attacks with some firearms without actually firing a single shot, this allows you to use these only when you really need extra firepower! It is so strange that this idea is not used more often!:)

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Time Pilot (c) 1982 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

Time Pilot is a multi-directionally scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player controls a futuristic jet fighter and takes on the role of pilot trying to rescue fellow pilots who are trapped in different time eras. The game consists of five different stages of play, each of which is set in a different time period.

As well as waves of attacking aircraft, each stage also features a large 'mother-ship' boss that must be destroyed to progress to the next stage. The game's five eras, common enemies and the mother-ships are as follows:

* 1910 The age of Biplane: Common enemies are biplanes, the mother-ship is a blimp
    
* 1940 The age of Monoplane: Common enemies are WWII monoplanes, the mother-ship is a B-25 Bomber.
    
* 1970 The age of Helicopter: Common enemies are helicopters, the mother-ship is a large, blue CH-46 Sea Knight
    
* 1982 The age of Jet plane: Common enemies are fighter jets, the mother-ship is a B-52 Bomber
    
* 2001 The age of U.F.O.: Common enemies are UFOs, the mother-ship is a large alien space craft

In the 1910 stage, the biplanes can fire bombs as well as slow-moving yellow bullets. The bombs are initially fired vertically but are affected by gravity, meaning that they will move faster as they fall to the bottom of the screen. 

In the 1940 stage, red-and-yellow supply planes sometimes fly horizontally across the screen. These require multiple hits to take down (much like the mother-ship) and reward the player 1,500 points upon their destruction. They cannot fire at the player and pose no real threat as long as the player does not crash into them.

In the 1970 stage, the helicopters fire homing missiles as well as yellow bullets. The missiles travel slightly faster than the player but cannot make sharp turns. The player can destroy missiles by shooting them or can avoid them by turning sharply.

In the 1982 stage, the jets can fire homing missiles as well as yellow bullets and are aggressive.

In the 2001 stage, the UFOs fire fast-moving circular bullets that blend in with the background. The asteroids on screen will not hurt the player but will serve to camouflage the enemies and their missiles.

All stages except the 2001 stage have parachutes that can be collected (these are the aforementioned trapped pilots). The mother-ships are destroyed with seven direct hits and once all five eras have been completed, the stages start over again with an increased level of difficulty.

Time Pilot was released in November 1982 in Japan.

Yoshiki Okamoto was told to design a driving game. When he learned of the game's concept, he balked at making it and started on Time Pilot. As development continued, Okamoto showed his boss design docs for the driving game, all the while working on Time Pilot. Although his boss told him to do the driving game instead, he tried to take the credit for Time Pilot. Okamoto decided not to disgrace his boss and let the episode go!!

The background moves in the opposite direction to the player's plane, rather than the other way around; the player's plane always remains in the center.

The 1910 and 2001 stages are never played in the attract mode.

- UPDATES -

Centuri and Atari versions:
* The jet plane stage is 1983 instead of 1982.
* The 2001 stage IS played in the attract mode.

- SCORING -

Biplane/Fighter/Helicopter/Jet/UFO: 100 points.
Bomb/Missile: 100 points.
Mother Ship: 3,000 points.
Bomber (1940 stage only): 1,500 points.
Formation Bonus: 2,000 points.
Parachute: 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* GAME INSTRUCTIONS:
l. Control your plane with joystick. Avoid being hit by bullets, bombs and missiles. Do not crash into enemy planes.
2. Advance to next stage by destroying 56 enemies and 7 hits on Mother Ship.
3. Dock with parachutes for bonus points.
4. Bonus plane after 10,000 points, 60,000 points and each additional 50,000 points.
5. Game over when all of your planes are destroyed.

* The enemy planes/ships find it hardest to shoot you when you are moving in a diagonal direction, so move this way the majority of the time. Just remember to watch your back!

* Since your ship is very maneuverable you can turn through 180 degrees very quickly to pick off an enemy directly behind you. Simply move the joystick or use the keys to face in the opposite direction and you will flip round.

* Homing missiles - keep firing to destroy them. Alternatively, move your fighter so that the missiles move off screen, and they do not return.

* The Mother Ships always move horizontally across the screen. Wait until they pass you, and then move directly behind them. You can then shoot them at will to destroy them. Again, it takes seven hits to destroy a Mother Ship.

* Concentrate on collecting the parachutists where possible, as these represent your biggest potential points haul. On Stage 2 (A.D. 1940), you can leave a few planes remaining and collect parachutists for as long as possible, as this stage has no homing missiles and also more parachutists than Stage 1.

* If you are killed by colliding with an enemy ship, you are registered with the points as if you had shot it. This means extra lives are still awarded and also if you collide with the Mother Ship, you will advance to the next stage, providing you have at least one life remaining.

* A Way To Get A Great Score: Finish the 1910 stage as soon as possible. On the 1940 stage, don't shoot anything!! Eventually, parachutes will start to appear. Collect the parachutes while avoiding the planes. Each parachute (after #4) will give you 5,000 points. It's possible to roll the machine over (999,999+ points) while remaining on Stage 2 using this strategy. By the way, while using this cheat you can also shoot the 1,500-point bombers without causing the time bar to be shortened.

Touki Denshou - Angel Eyes (c) 1996 Tecmo.

An all-female fighting game featuring 8 selectable angels engaging in one-on-one battle. This game is made by Tecmo, which is not surprising given that they are now more popular because of the "Dead or Alive" series (specifically because of its female characters) than their older series like "Ninja Gaiden".

Released in April 1996.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Fighting Princess Legend - Angel Eyes'.

The characters in this game are either hand drawn, similar to the style found in "Power Instinct 3 - Groove on Fight", or pre-rendered CG that are a bit better than the quality found in "Ragnagard", but not as good as "Killer Instinct"'s. There will be people who will find a pre-rendered CG character fighting a hand drawn character to be a visual clash in this game.

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Turtles in Time</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 31 years ago:

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Turtles in Time (c) 1991 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

The sequel to 1989's hugely successful original, 'Turtles in Time' once more sees the four heroes taking on Shredder and his army. Gameplay remains similar to the original game, but the experience is enhanced further with the obligatory improved graphics and sound effects. 'Turtles in Time' also features a larger variety of levels, as now the battle between good and evil rages across time as the Turtles travel to prehistoric, pirate and Wild West times in their pursuit of the elusive Splinter. 

Yet again, Konami's mastery of the genre was in evidence as the manic energy and humour of the cartoon and comic-book series upon which the game is based was captured perfectly.

- TRIVIA -

Turtles in Time was released in March 1991. 

This is the only franchise of the so-called 'Ameri-comi Connection' series that had an arcade sequel. 

Just like the previous game, it has references which don't come from the TV show in which is mainly based upon. The enemies at 'Skull &amp; Crossbones', Rhazar and Tokka, are the two mutants that Shredder creates to destroy the TMNT in the second movie and the Super Shredder form at 'Technodrome: The Final Shell Shock' also comes from the movie when he tries the mutagen on himself. 

This game is not based on the 3rd TMNT movie. In that movie the turtles travel in time only to the 1700's Japan. In this game, they don't even go to Japan. 

Soundtrack Releases: 
Konami All-Stars 1993 ~ Music Station of Dreams (KICA-9016~8) (December 24, 1992) 

The song that plays in the attract mode is known as 'Pizza Power' which is from the 'The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Coming Out of Our Shells Tour'. Here are the lyrics to Pizza Power: 

Growing up in a glass bowl, 
with chameleons, lizards, and tadpoles. 
It hardly enters your mind, 
that there's something better than this. 
A lettuce leaf or a carrot, 
maybe a seed from a parrot. 
Believe me when it gets you, 
the word gourmet just don't exist. 

(chorus) 
For pizza power, 
a flying saucer food delight. 
Pizza power, 
that power makes us feel all right.

		<name>Top Hunter - Roddy &amp; Cathy</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 28 years ago:

Top Hunter - Roddy &amp; Cathy (c) 1994 SNK.

Top Hunter: Roddy &amp; Cathy is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players who take on the role of the galaxy's top bounty hunters, Roddy and Cathy, who are sent to put a stop to a colony of galactic pirates called the Klaptons, who threaten and plunder the cosmos. Four high-ranking Klaptons have taken control of four elemental planets and big rewards are offered for the capture of Sly, Misty, Mr. Bigman and Dr. Burn.

The game's action takes place on two plains, with players able to jump between the foreground and background at will. This switching mechanic is integral to getting through some parts of the game. In addition to standard jump and attack mechanics, both players have the ability to extend their arms outwards. This ability can be used to grab items and enemies, some of which can then be thrown. The arm can also be extended vertically upwards, allowing players to pull themselves up onto ledges, pull items down to them, or pull handles to trigger events, such as dropping rocks onto enemies.

Each stage has several collectables to be found, including health, weapon power-ups and extra time. At certain points during a stage, players may come across a Mecha; this is a bi-pedal mechanical walker that gives players more power. The mecha also has limited health, however and the player will be forced out of it when it starts flashing. 

Top Hunter: Roddy &amp; Cathy is split into four planets: Forest, Ice, Wind, and Fire and players can choose which planet to tackle first. Depending on what stage is picked first, the layout of that stage will change. For example, if the player picks the Ice world before the Forest world, the Forest world's starting layout will be different. 

After completing all four worlds, the player is taken to the final stage, where they must fight a rematch with the four bosses before the final battle with the game's antagonist, Captain Klapton.

Released in May 1994.

The game borrows plenty of ideas from many of SNK's most popular fighting games at the time of its release. The two-plane stages were first used in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", also Roddy &amp; Cathy feature special moves that fans of "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting" are sure to recognize.

Mashing the attack button will make Roddy and Cathy go into a combo, with Roddy eventually letting out a flurry of punches, while Cathy does a Hyakuretsukyaku/Lightning Kick move. Doing a quarter-circle forward motion and hitting the attack button precisely will make the player do a Ko'ouken (or a hadouken with one hand) attack, while doing a shoryuken motion will make the player do a shoryuken/koho attack. The player can also do Terry Bogard's power wave as well.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Top Hunter - Shisekai Gakkyoku Zatsugidan - PCCB-00157) on July 21, 1994.

Thrash Rally (c) 1991 Alpha Denshi.

Thrash Rally is a top-down perspective rally racing game for one or two players. Each race begins with players asked to choose a vehicle in which to race, with each offering a different balance between handling, acceleration, vehicle endurance and top speed. 

There are two racing modes on offer. The first, World Rally Championship, features rounds that take place over lap-based circuits, with each lap having to be completed within a set time limit. World Rally mode offers players a choice of six different rally cars.

The second mode is the Paris-to-Dakar rally. This doesn’t feature laps but is a point-to-point race, with each stage having to be completed within a set time limit. In addition to the six rally cars of the World Rally mode, the Paris-to-Dakar Rally also allows players to race in either a buggy, a motorbike, or a truck.

All tracks feature a variety of different road surfaces, such as snow, gravel, sand or water. Many of the tracks also feature a variety of jumps and chicanes, as well as track-based obstacles that should be avoided.

		<name>Tron</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Tron (c) 1982 Bally Midway.

Tron is a 1- or 2-player game set inside the 'Tron' computer, and is based on the ground-breaking Disney movie of the same name.

Tron consists of twenty-two stages - or 'phases' - of play. Each phase consists of four separate games called "domains", all of which must be completed before moving on to the next phase. Players can determine the order in which each of the four domains is attempted, but the domain position is random and is only revealed once that domain has been chosen.

The four domains that make up a phase never change throughout the game, although both the difficulty level and number of enemies increases with each subsequent phase. The domains are as follows:

* LIGHT CYCLES: The player controls a Light Cycle that leaves a blue light trail in its wake. The aim is to 'box in' the yellow enemy Light Cycles, making them crash into either a cycle trail (theirs or the player's) or a wall. The player must also avoid any collision with either walls or light trails. The joystick controls the direction of the bike and the trigger controls its speed.

* I/O TOWER: Destroy the Grid Bugs that emerge from the grid surrounding the tower. The bugs will multiply and fill the entire screen if not stopped. Players must attempt to clear a path to - and enter - the I/O Tower before the timer runs out. The stick controls the movement of the player's character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

* TANK MAZE: Destroy all enemy tanks that are patrolling the maze. The player's tank can fire in all directions and can bounce shots off walls, but can be destroyed by a single shot; while enemy tanks can only fire in the direction of travel but need three shots before they are destroyed. "Recognizer" tanks also feature in later phases; these Do NOT shoot but move quickly and will try to ram the player's tank. The joystick controls the movement of the player's tank and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

* MCP CONE: Destroy the blocks in the descending, rotating coloured column to clear a path and move the character up into the light cone above the blocks. A bonus is awarded if all of the blocks are destroyed. The stick controls the movement of the character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

Bonus lives are awarded periodically throughout the game as specific point scores are reached. Each enemy and item has an assigned point value (see the "SCORING" section for details).

- TRIVIA -

Tron was released in May 1982.

When Bally/Midway signed a deal to create a Tron video game, they were very pressed for time and needed a game quickly. They decided to let all 3 of their design teams (their in-house team, Dave Nutting Associates, and Arcade Engineering) take a crack at a prototype. The Dave Nutting Associates team (led by Dave Armstrong) proposed a 3-D color vector game that was deemed too complex and expensive, thought it was later developed into a prototype called "Earth, Friend, Mission". The internal team eventually won the right to produce the game. The initial design document called for 6 different mini-games:
1) Rings (a light-disk duel between Tron and Sark).
2) Paranoia (in which the player builds a bridge of spiders to reach an island).
3) Tank Pursuit
4) Space Spores
5) I/O Tower (the player tries to reach an energy socket while avoiding electrifying blue warriors)
6) Light Cycles.

Fearing that they would never get the game out in time, the Rings game was made into a separate game and the Paranoia and I/O Tower game was dropped (though the MCP Cone sequence was later added). At one point the film included deadly spores that were included in the game's Grid Bug sequence, but when they were removed from the movie, they had to be removed from the game as well.

To promote the game, Bally/Midway and Alladin's Castle sponsored a seven-week-long tournament at over 400 locations throughout the country, as well as a celebrity tournament.

Most of the levels correspond to a computer language. Of course, some literary license was used for the level names and a couple of them don't really make sense. Anyway, here are the 11 level names and what they are:
ALGOL: Algorithmic Language. Influenced the development of more modern language (along with FORTRAN and LISP). Used for number crunching.
ASSEMBLY: Machine language. Used to write code directly to the computer without having to compile or interpret it.
BASIC: Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. Used primarily for teaching rudimentary programming.
COBOL: Common Business Oriented Language. Used primarily for accounting. Very old language.
FORTRAN: Formula Translator. Used for processing numbers and/or formulas.
JCL: Job Control Language. Used on IBM mainframes to execute specific jobs and scripts on the Job Entry Subsystem.
OS: Precursor language to OS2.
PASCAL: Teaching language for compiled languages. Not very powerful.
PL1: A play on the actual language called PLI. Language used for solving mathematical problems.
RPG: Report Program Generator. Use for generating reports. Usually used with COBOL.
SNOBOL: Used for character string manipulation.

Walt Disney Productions sued Williams Electronics for copyright and patent infringement over Williams' use of the name 'tron' in their arcade legend, "Robotron - 2084". Common sense prevailed, however, and Williams won the suit.

The game's sequel, "Discs of Tron" was originally intended to be a part of the original game but tight time constraints meant that the mini-game was not completed in time.

A Tron unit appears in the 1983 movie, 'War Games', in the 1986 movie 'The Color of Money' and in the 1987 movie, 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'.

- UPDATES -

OLDER VERSION (clone 6/15 in Mame):
* Level 1 (RPG) gives you 1000 on the timer instead of 500 in the I/O Tower game, making it easier to get the 1000 point bonus for killing all grid bugs in Level 1.
* The series of sounds that play when blocks are destroyed in the MCP Cone game are higher in pitch than in the other versions of Tron.
* Each phase features different pattern schemes from the other versions - Play Level 2 (COBOL) in the other version, and then play Level 2 in the (6/15) version, keeping the Game Difficulty setting at the default (5) each time, and you'll see what we mean.

- SCORING -

Scoring in this game is relatively easy since there aren't a lot of enemies to keep track of.
Grid Bugs: 50 points
Bit: 5000 points
Blocks: 25 points
Light Cycles: 500 points

Tanks...
1st Hit: 100 points
2nd Hit: 300 points
3rd Hit: 500 points

You get a 1000 point bonus for destroying all the Grid Bugs.
You get the remaining time added to your score when you enter the I/O Tower.

NOTE: On Level 1 (RPG), you only get 500 on the timer. On all other levels, you get 1000 on the timer. EXCEPTION: As stated in the "Updates" section above, if you're playing the (6/15) version, you always get 1000 on the timer, even on Level 1.

You get a 1000 point bonus for destroying all the Blocks.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When you start the game, you will have a cursor in the middle of a computer-looking grid. You have 8 seconds to go one of 4 directions on that grid. If you don't, you will be randomly sent in a direction. Once you have completed an area, you can no longer go to that area until you get to the next level. The areas are randomized on this computer grid so you won't know what you will get next. Below are the four areas and strategies to get through them.

* I/O TOWER: This is one of the easier areas to get through. It just involves a lot of shooting.
- Quickly establish where the Grid Bugs are. That way you can quickly aim to clear out a path if necessary.
- The game simulation sailor comes out at random times and drops the Bit off. Do everything you can to get to it for a free 5,000 points.
- Work your way to one of the exits and 'camp out'. Just use the spinner to aim high and low to take care of the Grid Bugs. Once the timer hits 100, go ahead and exit the screen.
- It is possible to get over 10,000 points in this area alone (5,000 for the Bit and over 5,000 for Grid Bugs killed).
- On the earlier levels, try to take out all of the Grid Bugs for the 1,000 point bonus.

* LIGHT CYCLES: This is one of the harder areas until you learn the patterns. Then it will become a breeze.
- The arena for this game is a 9 x 9 grid. Use the grid lines to gauge distances and to also know where the turns are.
- Hitting the wall, your light trail, or an enemy light trail will end your cycling career very quickly.
- Depending on the machine set up, you will need to identify different patterns and make the appropriate adjustments to your strategy. Make sure you are staying at full speed until the enemy light cycles are trapped.
- Usually you can adjust when you see enemy cycles coming after you. A lot of times they will follow another cycle into the wall or a light trail. The enemy cycles become much quicker after level 10.
- If the three light cycles are coming straight down, go right and up around them. Then do a rectangle pattern leaving an opening to the right side to allow the enemy cycles to crash against the wall.
- Use the above pattern if the middle or right cycles go straight (the other ones will veer around before they head down).
- For any other occasion, it's best to go left and make a box that way. Again, the enemy cycles will destroy themselves before you get into trouble.

* MCP CONE: Another easier area.  Even if you mess up a little, you can still recover from your mistake.
- First, determine the cone's speed and direction of travel. You can accomplish the second thing by shooting at it to determine which way the hole travels.
- Next, determine your speed. This will determine how much time you have to blow through the cone to get to the exit.
- Once you have determined the above, go over to the side that the cone is entering from. For example, if the cone is moving from left to right, the go over to the left side and start shooting.
- The 4 block cones are pretty easy. Just rapidly blast a path and go up.
- The 6 block cones are a little trickier. You will need to open up the bottom part of the cone. Enter this new opening and start to chew at the top. You will end up having blocks rotate below you as you head up. Be careful and watch around you since you will end up surrounded by blocks before you enter the exit.
- The hardest cone to get through is when Tron is travelling fast and the cone is moving slow. You have to quickly blast a path any way you can or you will collide with the cone.
- For extra points, you can position yourself half-way out of the exit and blast at the top blocks. On the earlier levels, try to get the 1,000 point bonus.

* TANKS: Probably the hardest area of the game. You have to learn how to move and shoot (in different directions) at the same time.
- It takes 3 hits to destroy an enemy tank. You have the advantage, though, by being able to use rapid fire and bouncing your shots off the walls. Enemy tanks can only have one shot out a time.
- This rebounding of shots can be a very effective offensive measure. You may be able to hit tanks from afar or hit them around corners just by rebounding your shots just right. Prevent them from getting close.
- The pink teleporter area is the key to surviving many of the tank patterns. Just don't go too far in or you may end up teleporting to a hostile environment very quickly.
- If you stay off the tank trails, enemy tanks will not fire on you. They can, however, ram your tank (this is especially true if you are hanging out in the teleportation area).
- Like other parts of Tron, there are patterns you can use on the specific tank patterns to ensure your survival.

* This is an interesting bug. On the MCP Cone levels, if you go all the way to the right or the left and keep moving, you can move the whole playfield to the side. This doesn't seem to have any other affect.

* Here's an odd Tron bug: On the Recognizer Tank levels, make your way to one of the little alcoves in either the top right, or bottom left corners. The tanks cannot shoot, and will not go down an alcove, so therefore cannot kill you. Then, wait approximately 9 to 10 minutes without moving your tank. You can fire, but do not kill all the recognizers. After the time (9-10 mins), the sound system will go berzerk, starting with a very high pitch tone, which falls to a low tone that vibrates the cabinet. The sound also goes berzerk if you enter the tower at 0099 units on the bug screen.

Toaplan Company, Limited was a video game developer from Japan. They were responsible for the creation of a wide array of relatively famous scrolling shooters and other arcade games. The company declared bankruptcy in 1994.

- UPDATES -

As with many Toaplan games, the original Japanese version is harder than export versions. Truxton II is like the original Truxton, where all regional versions are on a single board, controlled by a jumper; anything labeled Tatsujin Oh will be harder than anything labeled Truxton II (Europe and USA versions).

		<name>Neo Turf Masters / Big Tournament Golf</name>
		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 26 years ago:

Big Tournament Golf (c) 1996 Nazca Corporation.

Big Tournament Golf is an arcade golf game in which one or two players choose from a selection of six different golfers, each of which has different strengths and weaknesses to their game. This allows players to select a golfer that suits their preferred style of gameplay. 

The six golfers and their attributes are:
* Young Hero (USA) Driving 3 - Accuracy 3 - Skill 3 - Recovery 3 - Putting 3
* Technician (United Kingdom) Driving 2 - Accuracy 4 - Skill 5 - Recovery 4 - Putting 3
* Veteran (Australia) Driving 1 - Accuracy 2 - Skill 4 - Recovery 5 - Putting 2
* Shot Maker (Germany) Driving 4 - Accuracy 5 - Skill 2 - Recovery 2 - Putting 4
* Power Golfer (Brazil) Driving 5 - Accuracy 1 - Skill 1 - Recovery 1 - Putting 1
* Putt Master (Japan) Driving 3 - Accuracy 2 - Skill 4 - Recovery 2 - Putting 5

Players can choose to play on one of four eighteen-hole courses: Germany, Japan, Australia and U.S.A. Two game modes are available: one-player stroke play against the CPU, or stroke or match-play against a second player.

Unlike many golf games of the era that used a two-click swing system to determine the hook or slice of the ball, "Neo Turf Masters" uses a single click for the power of the shot and a second for the height of the shot. Hook and slice are determined before making the shot. 

Big Tournament Golf follows the standard golf scoring system. The order from the best to the worst performance is:
Albatros (3 hits under Par)
Eagle (2 hits under Par)
Birdie (1 hit under Par)
Par (reach the par for the hole)
Bogey (1 hit over Par)
Double Bogey (2 hits over Par)
Triple Bogey (3 hits over Par)

If players miss the attempt to make a Triple Bogey, they will have to give up the hole and will suffer an additional penalty. If the ball lands out of bounds or in the water, the player will be penalized one stroke.

* Contests are sometimes announced at the start of a hole:

1) The closest to the pin contest: players must hit the ball as close as possible to the pin when driving off. If their ball gets closer to the pin than the previous record, they will earn a bonus hole.

2) The longest driving contest: players must drive the ball as far as possible. If they exceed the previous record, they will earn a bonus hole.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Random Selection: Press A+B+C+D at the player selection and/or the course selection screen.

* Sometimes contests appear during a hole:

1) The closest to the pin contest: you have to hit the ball as close as possible to the hole in one hit. If the ball gets closer to the pin than the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.

2) The longest driving contest: you have to drive the ball as far as possible. If you exceed the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.

- TRIVIA -

Twin Cobra was released in October 1987. Licensed to Romstar for US distribution (November 1987).

Differences between Twin Cobra (TC) and Kyukyoku Tiger (KT):
* TC supports two simultaneous players.
* KT supports two players, but only one at a time. For this reason, it also supports Table Top cabinets.
* TC stores 3 characters for high scores.
* KT stores 6 characters for high scores.
* TC heroes are Red and Blue for player 1 and 2 respectively.
* KT heroes are grey for both players.
* TC defeated remains of ground tanks are circular.
* KT defeated remains of ground tanks always vary in shape.
* TC respawns a killed player at their current position.
* KT respawns a killed player at predefined positions. After dying and your new hero appears, if you do not travel past the respawn point, you are penalized and moved back further when your next hero appears. Due to this difference in continuing, KT is MUCH harder and nearly impossible to complete!

		<desc>SNK Neo-Geo MVS cart. published 25 years ago:

Twinkle Star Sprites (c) 1997 SNK.

Twinkle Star Sprites is a competitive scrolling shooter game originally created by ADK. It was ADK's last production for the Neo-Geo platform. The gameplay, which can be characterized as a combination of a fixed shooter and a versus puzzle game, uses combinations of shots, as well as timed power-ups to attempt to damage the opponent. These attacks also serve as counters to the opponent's attack.

An interesting &amp; highly cute hybrid between a Vs style puzzle game &amp; an overhead shooter, players may choose to play the Story Mode in order to see the misadventures of Load Ran &amp; her faithful yet somewhat annoying Rabbicat as they try to find the Magical Twinkle Star &amp; save their world from the evil Mevious &amp; his henchmen. The other option is to play the Free Character Mode in which you are able to pick any character (see codes under Tips and Tricks) to play the game and see their very own comical ending. A second player may challenge you at any time.

- TRIVIA -

Twinkle Star Sprites was released in January 1997.

The game's concept seems to be a funny parody of the Sailor Moon manga, however the game's comic relief 'Rabbicat' seems to be a parody of Tenchi Muyo's very own cute mascot &amp; comic relief 'Ryo-Oh-Ki' the cabbit.

Load Ran &amp; Sprites feature different endings in the Free Character Mode, these endings are completely different to the one seen in the Story Mode.

In the story mode, Mevious will either taunt or praise you if continues have been used during your game or not!

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Twinkle Star Sprites - PCCB-00247) on 21/02/1997.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

There are two types of standard attacks: a normal shot and a charge-up shot. Each character starts with two bombs which enables him in the event of desperate plight, to clean with the screen while briefly acquiring a state of invincibility. The two players' playfields are separated by a vertical bar, each one having its own independent of the other. Series of enemies arrive from the top of the screen. The player is to successfully destroy them in chains (combos), which will send one or more fireball projectiles to the screen of his adversary (Normal Attack). Shooting at Normal Attacks several times reflects them back as glowing Reverse Attacks. If Reverse Attacks are reflected again, a number of powerful counterattacks in the shape of one or more indestructible enemies appear (Extra Attack). Reflecting many Reverse Attacks at once can instead summon a boss (Boss Attack).

* The Extra Attacks and the Boss Attack vary from one character to another.

* The power gauge fills as the player destroys enemies up to three levels. By holding down the fire button and releasing when a certain level is reached, the player can launch a character-specific charge shot to assist the player in clearing enemies from his screen. At Level 1, the charge shot is launched. At Level 2, the charge shot and three Extra Attacks against the opponent are launched. At Level 3 (Max Level), the charge shot and a Boss Attack are launched. Firing charge shots at Level 2 and above will decrease the power gauge.

* 30–40 seconds into a round, a blue orb appears among a chain of enemies. If this orb is destroyed in a chain, the player achieves Fever status for the next several seconds. Chains created during Fever generate faster and more plentiful Normal Attacks per enemy destroyed, which can prove to be very dangerous to the opponent if large chains are made.

* Both players are given five life points at the start of a round.

* Colliding into an enemy costs 1 life point, but the player cannot be killed this way; if a player has one life point left, he will be left with one half of a life point. When this happens, his character is stunned for a short while and is reduced in speed and attack power for several seconds after recovery, all the while left more vulnerable to opponent attacks.

* Getting hit by a Normal Attack, Reverse Attack, Extra Attack or the projectiles from a Boss cost 3 life points.
    
* The match is over when a player loses all his life points.

* When a player takes damage, his opponent recovers life points equal to half of the damage taken.

* If a round lasts longer than 100 seconds or the player does not fire a shot for more than 30 seconds, a Death enemy appears. If a player is hit by this enemy, he will lose immediately (Death Attack). The Death can be destroyed as any other enemy, but always comes back, harder to kill. Additionally, if a player is successful in volleying the "death" character over to his opponent's side, and the death character touches the opponent, the opponent dies instantly. This is a possible, though difficult, way to win. This, of course, would require the player to be skilled enough to avoid obstacles and not fire for more than 30 seconds.

* Special Codes:
Play As Sprites: At the character select screen, put the selector on Ran and press Up(x4), A.

Play As Memory: At the character select screen, put the selector on Ran and press Down(x4), A.

Play As Mevious: At the character select screen, put the selector on Griffon and press Up(x4), A.

Play As Dark Ran: At the character select screen, put the selector on Griffon and press Down(x4), A.

* After the Game Over screen, Load Ran &amp; Rabbicat rate your performance and either praise you or give you advice to improve your score, get a very high score (1,000.000 and above) in order to attain the highest rating and make Load Ran blush.

Undercover Cops (c) 1992 Irem.

Undercover Cops is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for up to three players in which Dr. Clayborn and his henchmen have taken control of the city. Police Commissioner Gordon has called on three of New York's Finest undercover cops: Bubba, an ex-professional football player; Flame, a former Miss America; and Claude, a retired philosophy teacher. They must fight every lackey and vanquish Dr. Clayborn in order to restore law and order to the city. 

Besides the usual human thugs, players fight strange mole creatures and mutants with jet packs and blades for hands. Players can never use enemy weapons, but the stages contain objects that can be picked up and used instead, These include burning oil drums, steel girders, concrete columns that shatter on impact, boxes of hand grenades and giant fish. 

As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is more powerful than standard attacks but each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's health is lost.

Player characters can eat mice, frogs, birds and snails to restore their health. The game consists of five stages with a powerful enemy boss character waiting at the end of each one.

Violent Storm (c) 1993 Konami Company, Limited.

Violent Storm is a sideways-scrolling beat-em-up for up to three players set in the aftermath of World War III. The survivors of the war are attempting to rebuild their world but are being terrorised by violent gangs . Three vigilante heroes called 'Boris', 'Wade' and 'Kyle' are trying to protect the citizens but are hampered in their efforts by the evil and corrupt 'GELD' gang. As the heroes are patrolling the streets, they see their friend, Sheena, kidnapped by the gang. The vigilantes must fight through seven enemy-packed stages to rescue their friend and destroy the gang.

As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's health is lost. Health levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in breakable crates and barrels. 

Some of the gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players. Destructible crates and barrels also contain weapons and random bonus items. Stunned enemies fall to the ground and can still be attacked while prone.

At the middle of the last stage, two cabinets of "Penta" and "Scramble" make an appearance (Note that "Penta" is originally a bootleg of "Pengo"). 

One of the bonus point items is a Twinbee doll.

King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Amusement Sounds '94 Spring - KICA-7631, 7632) on February 23, 1994.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Some Tips: keep an eye out for unusual weapons, smash the light bulbs in the 2nd stage to temporary blind your enemies ! Also grab the piggies in this stage and they turn into footballs that you can use as projectiles ! (now you know where the term 'pigskin' comes from !):)

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 33 years ago:

Volfied (c) 1989 Taito Corp.

Volfied is an abstract action shoot-em-up and is an update of Taito's 1981 classic, "Qix". Set in a distant galaxy, a space pilot returns to his home world of Volfied to find it under attack by an unknown alien force. The planet's few remaining inhabitants are hiding underground and have managed to get a signal through to the pilot asking for his help. The pilot must eliminate the alien threat and save his people.

The player controls a craft (called 'The Monotros') that can move around the edges of a rectangle. Holding down the draw button allows the craft to move into unclaimed territory and draw lines in an attempt to create a closed rectangle. If completed, the captured area changes to a different background graphic. 

Each stage features a large enemy and several smaller enemies and when the player's spaceship succeeds in claiming a rectangular section, the side in which the main enemy is located is considered to be the 'outside'. Any smaller enemies ending up on the 'inside' are killed, resulting in point bonuses. Players are only in danger from enemies while they are actually drawing a line, although each level must be completed within a tight time limit.

Grey boxes sometimes appear on the field that award a random power-up when collected (by being trapped 'inside' a completed rectangle). These range from extra speed or upgraded weapons, to a temporary enemy freeze.

Vampire Savior 2 was released in September 1997 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 26th video game released for the CPS2 hardware.

During the intro, a fast montage of images appears in a snap second. If you slow down the emulation, you'll find that the images are actually sketches of various characters from the game (Notably, "Vampire Hunter 2" had a fast montage too, at the same point in the intro, but with different artwork).

Donovan's appearance in this game is part of a lie by Capcom: In the original draft for Vampire Savior, Donovan would have been turned into a type of demon, while Anita, now in her teens, would be added to the roster, most likely as a 'new' character. However, instead, both characters were cut, and only restored, suddenly ageless, for Vampire Savior 2, without the changes.

This game is not canon due to the above errata, and other chronological faults, like the inclusion of Pyron, who was destroyed in the original tournament.

- TRIVIA -

Released in November 1996.

'Waku Waku' is Japanese onomatopoiea for sounds of excitement.

The bonus stage battle against Bonus Kun, the Shotokan punching bag, is a parody of Ryu and Ken of "Street Fighter" fame. Watch him imitate all of their best moves! It also appears that Bonus Kun's music stage is a parody of 'The Theme of Ryu', which is, as the name implies, the theme music for Ryu in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior".

Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Waku Waku 7 - PCCB-00215) on 21/08/1996.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 43 years ago:

Warrior (c) 1979 Vectorbeam.

Two vector knights battle each other in an overhead death pit.

Main CPU: CCPU (@ 5 Mhz)

Screen orientation: Horizontal

Players: 2

- TRIVIA -

Released in October 1979, Warrior was the first one-on-one fighting game.

Back in the 1970s, a few arcade distributors still held on to the exclusivity rules that were a holdover from the older pinball days. Because of this, many arcade game manufacturers had several different names. Atari was also 'Kee' and 'Horror Games'. While 'Sega' was also known as 'Gremlin'. Many people think that Vectorbeam and Cinematronics were the same way. But that wasn't how it really worked with them. Vectorbeam was originally an independent company. They had purchased several titles from Cinematronics in the past, but were a totally different company. But in 1978 Cinematronics bought Vectorbeam so they could have their patents. They promptly released Warrior under the Vectorbeam name, and then shut the company down soon after.

It was a very rare game. There was only one way to buy this game, and that was in a dedicated cabinet, and only upright versions were available (and this was one heavy game, weighing in at 280 lbs). This particular title had white sides with sticker style sideart of two Knights crossing swords while a sinister castle loomed above them. The marquee, monitor bezel, and control panel all had graphics of swords and energy beams. There were two joysticks on the control panel, and they were of a very sturdy design, and were probably the only thing on a Warrior machine that wasn't bound to fail in a few years.

The game used a rather complicated display system that included a 19'' black and white vector monitor, a half-silvered mirror, and a detailed plastic display of the game background. Those items all came together to make it look like the action was happening directly on the picture of the background, instead of on the monitor itself.

		<name>Wonder Boy - Monster Land</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 35 years ago:

Wonder Boy in Monster Land (c) 1987 Sega.

Wonder Boy in Monster Land is a multi-directional scrolling platform hack 'n' slash game with RPG elements, in which the game's hero, Wonder Boy, has seen his home of Wonderland invaded by the evil 'MEKA Dragon' and its army of minions. 

At the start of the game Wonder Boy is unarmed, but the mayor of Wonder Land (as it was known before the invasion) gives him a short sword to help him in his quest. Wonder Boy has a life meter represented as a series of red hearts and whenever he sustains damage, the hearts deplete. When all the hearts are depleted, Wonder Boy dies and the game ends. As well as the life meter, there is also an Hourglass Timer at the top of the screen; whenever this runs out, Wonder Boy loses some life. The Timer can be refilled by collecting hourglasses or by visiting hospitals or taverns.

Enemies can be killed by being stabbed with the sword, with many requiring multiple hits. Bags of gold and gold coins can be found (either dropped by some defeated enemies, or appearing when players jump in certain spots) for use in the shops that appear in each stage. Players can buy upgrades to Wonder Boy's boots (for better jumping and faster running speed), shield and armour. 

As well as gold and coins, there are many other items located throughout the game. These include necklaces, harps, mirrors and crowns that increase the player's score; hearts that refill the life meter; gauntlets that temporarily double Wonder Boy's attack power; helmets that temporarily provide additional protection from enemy attacks; Winged Boots that allow Wonder Boy to fly over obstacles; Revival Potions and magic mantles that make Wonder Boy temporarily invisible. Other special items hidden in the game which the player must find include letters, the flute, various charms, the bell and the ruby.

Wonder Boy in Monster Land is divided into twelve levels for players to battle through to reach the Meka Dragon, and each has its own unique features, items, monsters and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Most stages include a boss that once defeated, leaves behind a key to the next stage. Defeating a boss also strengthens Tom-Tom's sword.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* This game has hidden coins that appear when you jump in certain spots. The demo screen shows a couple of these. Some of them will give you 60 gold or more every time.

* How to get 60+ golds from hidden coins: Besides the general strategy of quickly wiggling the joystick right and left while jumping (which raises the chance to get 60+ golds), certain coins, in certain places within the game, will ALWAYS yield 60+ golds if you perform particular actions:
1) Round 2: On the screen after you kill the Vampire, there's a platform with a Shoe Shop and some stairs which lead downwards to an Infirmary. Wait for the little mushroom to go down the stairs, and stand so that you are almost off the topmost stair. The mushroom will come back up and hit you, making you fall off the stairs. Hold the joystick to the left so that when you land you walk into the bottom step. This will drop a 60+ coin. NOTE: This trick only works if you haven't bought any shoes yet.
2) Round 3: On the stage after you kill the Red Knight, you'll see some jellyfishes on platforms over the water. At the first jellyfish you come to, wait for it to drop into the water, then lean out of the platform putting yourself on its trajectory. The jellyfish will hit you, and you'll get a 60+ golds bag. NOTE: This trick is shown during the attract mode.
3) Round 3 (Baraboro): Climb the ladder to the platform where the Shield Shop and Catherine's window are located. Once you're atop the ladder, let the mouse hit you. You'll fall leftwards, triggering a 60+ golds bag.
4) Round 6 (Pyramid): Beneath the platform where the Infirmary is located, there are some spikes. Approach the spikes as much as possible, then hit jump and fire at the same time, and keep hitting them every time you land. Some coins will start to fall from the platform and head towards you. If you'll keep a pace as much regular as possible, many of those coins will yield 60+ golds.

World Heroes was released on July 28, 1992. It is Alpha Denshi's first game in the fighting game genre. It was even the last game with the Alpha logo labeled within the game before the developer became ADK; however, the Alpha logo was last used on one of the arcade flyers of its sequel.

Due to the game's success in the fighting game market, the game was followed by a sequel, World Heroes 2, less than a year later.

The popular "Death Match" mode (removed from World Heroes 2 Jet and World Heroes Perfect) may have been inspired by the growing popularity of deathmatch style pro-wrestling in Japan at the time which was mostly made famous by Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling.

Hanzo is based on the real Hanzo Hattori Musashige (just like Hanzo in "Samurai Shodown").
Fuuma is based on the real Kotaro Fuuma Nobuyuki (1581-1603).
Kim Dragon is Alpha Denshi's homage to Bruce Lee (1940-1973).
Janne is based on the real Jeanne d'Arc who was burned in 1431.
Rasputin is based on the real Gregoriy Yefimovich Rasputin (1869-1917).
Brocken is loosely based on Rudolph von Stroheim from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
Muscle Power is most likely based on the real Hulk Hogan (1953-20XX).
J. Carn is based on the real Genghis Khan (1162-1229).

The first World Heroes game is also the only game in the series where Kim Dragon is Chinese. He was then changed into a South Korean character for the rest of the World Heroes series.

The name of the Scientist who invents the time machine in the intro is Dr. Brown which might have been inspired by the character Dr. Emmett L. Brown (a.k.a. Doc) from the Back To The Future movies.

- TRIVIA -

World Heroes 2 was released in April 1993.

Captain Kidd is based on the real Captain William Kidd (1645-1701).
Erick is loosely based on Erik the Red.
Mudman is similar to protagonist of Daijiro Morohoshi's "Mud Men" series in Monthly Sh?nen Champion Z?kan.
Ryoko is based on famous real-life judoka Ryoko Tani (formerly Ryoko Tamura). Fighter's History, released in the same year as this game, featured a character with the same basis and name (on a related note).
Shura is based on the legendary Muay Thai hero Nai Khanom Tom.
The last boss of this game was inspired by the character 'Baoh' from the manga of the same name.

The difficulty setting seems to have no effect on the game, the game is just as difficult on Level 1 as it is on Level 8!

The 'Skinhead' Deathmatch level, like in the first game, does not feature any trap or hazard to look out for, however the loser in this particular ring will get his/her head shaven!:)

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Alternate Costume Colors: Press B button when selecting a character.

* Most characters have a preset multi-hit combo that can be used by simply tapping the punch button many times while next to an enemy!

* Some characters that have hold-type throws (Kim Dragon, Ryoko, Muscle Power, Rasputin &amp; J. Maximum) can drain LOTS of energy of a CPU controlled fighter by quickly shaking the joystick left or right while performing a hold! Oddly enough, this trick does not seem to work with some character's holds such as Janne, Captain Kidd &amp; Mudman though!

World Heroes Perfect was released in May 1995. The game was feveloped by ADK. ADK's name is 'Alpha Denshi Kikaku'.

Son Gokuu is based on the famous mythological character known as Sun Wukong from "Journey to the West".

Since World Heroes Perfect, ADK games has gone out of business and all intellectual properties and copyrights to the games and characters have passed to SNK Playmore. Hanzo, Fuuma, Mudman and Neo-Dio would then appear in the fighting game "NeoGeo Battle Coliseum" (along with Kisarah from Aggressors of Dark Kombat, also by ADK) as a result.

Soundtrack Releases:

- UPDATES -

In the Japanese version of the game, there is Japanese text underneath each players life bar during a fight displaying the player's taunts, yells and screams during a fight in text form. Combo information is also shown there when you do a combo. This feature is removed from non-Japanese versions of the game. This also occurred in World Heroes 2 Jet.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Alternate Costume Colors: Press D button when selecting a character.

* Play Against Son Gokuu: Get 3 special stage finishes on the each round. If you're done correctly, you will fight Son Gokuu.

* Play as Son Gokuu: At the character selection screen, Hold C and press Up (x2), Down (x2), Left (x2), Right (x2), then press BC at the same time. If you're done correctly, Son Gokuu will appear left side of Jack the Ripper.

* Play as Neo-Dio: At the character selection screen, Hold B and press Up (x2), Down (x2), Left (x2), Right (x2), then press BC at the same time. If you're done correctly, Neo-Dio will appear right side of Ryofu.

Flying Power Disc (c) 1994 Data East Corp.

A flying disk game from Data East.

- TECHNICAL -

Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.
Game ID: NGM-065

Players: 2
Control: 8-Way Joystick
Buttons: 2

- TRIVIA -

Flying Power Disc was released on February 17, 1994 in Japan.

This game is known outside Japan as Windjammers.

Each characters in game has his own native language (i.e. Costa says 'Perfecto').

Flying Power Disc contains 2 mini-games. After the second match, Dog Distance consists in catching the disc as far as possible with your dog. After the fourth match, Flying Disc Bowling allows us to make strikes and spares with the flying disc.

Flying Power Disc is based on the real world flying disc sport called '10-S'. But the inventor of the 10-S has never give permission or signed any agreement to allow Neo Geo or Data East to use 10-S as a model for Windjammers. It have never been compensated for the illegal use of 10-S rules and method of play. 10-S was created in 1977 and copyrighted in 1980.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Fighters History Dynamite &amp; Flying Power Disc - PCCB-00149) on March 18, 1994.

Curiously, B. Yoo of Korea is replaced with S. Miller of Britain only on the USA Territory dip switch setting. The sprites remain exactly the same, but the voice is changed to that of an Englishman.

		<name>WWF: Wrestlemania</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 27 years ago:

WWF - Wrestlemania (c) 1995 Midway Mfg. Co.

WWF - Wrestlemania is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players featuring eight selectable wrestlers taken from the real-world WWF scene of the time. 

The game features two single-player modes: the 'Intercontinental Championship' and the 'WWF Championship'. In Intercontinental Championship mode, the player must win four one-on-one matches, two Handicap 2-on-1 matches, and one Handicap 3-on-1 match to win the title. 

In the more difficult 'WWF Championship' mode, players must win four Handicap 2-on-1 matches, two Handicap 3-on-1 matches and finally a "WrestleMania Challenge," in which the player must defeat every wrestler in the game in a gauntlet, starting with a three-on-one setup, with each eliminated opponent being replaced with another until all eight have been defeated.

WWF - Wrestlemania utilises five buttons: Punch, Power Punch, Block, Kick, Power Kick. The eight featured wrestlers are:
Bret Hart 
Shawn Michaels
Undertaker
Razor Ramon
Bam Bam Bigelow
Yokozuna
Lex Luger
Doink

- TRIVIA -

WWF Wrestlemania was released in August 1995.

The Midway coin-op has, within its code, the engine for a graphical reworking of Robotron, to be played like "Pong" in "Mortal Kombat II". However, the graphics were removed due to memory constraints, so the feature remains disabled.

If you look in the crowd, you can see the people who made this game possible. Right smack in the middle, is Mark Turmell.Mark Turmell is the main guy responsible for this game. The others are:
* In the crowd from Turmell to the right...
Sal Divita (head artist)
Sheridan Oursler (hardware tech)
Josh Tsui (artist)
Eugene Greer (artist)
Tony Goskie (artist)
Mark Penacho (programmer, but not on this game)
* In the crowd from Turmell to the left...
Jason Skiles (programmer and avid Internet user)
Jake Simpson (programmer) (wearing the MK t-shirt)
Mancow Muller (radio dj on Rock 103.5 and devout WWF fan)
Sophia (Mancow's significant other)
Dewey Gosnell (network tech)
Jamie Rivett (programmer)

Here are the real names of the wrestlers:
Bret Hart - Bret Hart
Shawn Michaels - Michael Shawn Hickenbottom
Undertaker - Mark Calaway
Razor Ramon - Scott Hall (1958-2022)
Bam Bam Bigelow - Scott Bigelow (1961-2007)
Yokozuna - Rodney Anoa'i (1966-2000)
Lex Luger - Lawrence Pfohl
Doink - Matt Osborne (1957-2013) (1st), Steve Keirn (2nd), Ray Apollo (3rd), Steve Lombardi (4th), Dusty Wolfe (5th).

The filming for characters must have been somewhere between July and September of 1993 judging by the appearances of the wrestlers in this game.

Legendary rumor that Adam Bomb is hidden within the annals of the game was confirmed by Sal DiVita in a review of the new 'WWE All Stars' game in 2011. However he stated that the character was incomplete and there was no sense in attempting to procure him.

About fatalities: The original plan was for all 8 wrestlers to have finishing moves, but once the WWF got wind of it, they ordered Midway to not put any more in.

The World Wrestling Federation is now known as World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), having lost a lawsuit with the World Wildlife Fund over the use of the abbreviation WWF in 2000. The company changed their name to WWE 2 years later.

At the time of the game's release, the WWF Champion was Diesel (Kevin Nash) who is absent from the game. However, at the time of the game's development, the WWF Champion was Yokozuna, who was a WWF Tag Team Champion at the time of release, his tag team partner Owen Hart (1965-1999) is absent from the game.

		<name>Xevious</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 40 years ago:

Xevious (c) 1982 Namco.

Xevious (pronounced 'zeevious') is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player pilots the heavily-armed 'Solvalou' combat ship and must destroy the evil Xevious forces trying to take over the planet. The Solvalou is equipped with two weapon systems; the forwards-firing "air zapper" for shooting air-based enemies and 'blaster bombs', for destroying ground-based enemies. To enable accurate targetting of the air-to-ground blaster bombs, a white and blue targeting indicator is situated in front of the Solvalou. This flashes when an enemy is in its sights.

Enemy craft appear in a number of different guises; from the standard variety that arrive in large numbers but shoot slow-moving projectiles, to exploding black spheres that shoot projectiles at high speed. There are also rotating shields that cannot be destroyed and must be carefully avoided. Ground enemies are a combination of both stationary bases and moving vehicles, most of which fire slow-moving projectiles. A gigantic, floating fortress called 'Andor Genesis' appears in certain areas; this is defeated by knocking out its core. 

Xevious is divided into 16 different areas, each separated by an area of forest. If the player dies before less than 70% of an area has been completed, play restarts at the beginning of the same area; should a life be lost AFTER 70% of an area has been completed, however, play restarts at the beginning of the next area. After Area 16 has been completed, the game loops back to Area 7.

The game becomes progressively more difficult as the player becomes more skilled - once the player does well at destroying a certain enemy type, a more advanced enemy type will replace it. This can be reverted by destroying flashing-red 'Zolback' radars found on the ground, which will cause the more advanced enemies to be replaced with weaker ones.

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

AIR UNITS: 
These are the air units you will encounter during the game. A players skill will determine what air units they may face. 
* Andor Genesis (mother ship) - the large ship in Areas 4, 9, and 14. 
* Bacura (resistor shield) - the large rotating floating walls which are indestructible. 
* Brag Zakato (energy blaster) - medium black ball, with a red dot, that explode and send several shots at your Solvalou. 
* Bragza (crystal) - the crystal core of the Andor Genesis mother ship which escapes upon its destruction. 
* Garu Zakato (energy bombarder) - large black ball that explode sending out a multitude of shots in all directions. 
* Giddo Spario (energy blast) - small, white crystal-like projectiles that come in diagonally at your Solvalou. 
* Jara (spinner) - looks like a UFO with a spinning gear in the middle. 
* Kapi (deflector) - flat-looking fighter with two front projections that flies in, fires multiple shots, then escapes quickly. 
* Sheonite (escort) - small spinning diamond-shaped craft which escort your Solvalou for a bit and fly off. 
* Terrazi (destructor) - flat looking, diamond shaped fighter that flies in, fires multiple shots, then escapes quickly.

* Barra (energy station) - small pyramid-shaped buildings. 
* Boza Logram (dome network) - a structure of four Lograms surrounding a Derota. 
* Derota (defense site) - the small octagonal-shaped gun batteries that fire multiple shots at your Solvalou. 
* Domogram (rover) - looks like a mobile Logram that travels along the roads and fires shots at your Solvalou. 
* Garu Barra (energy base) - medium and large pyramid-shaped buildings. 
* Garu Derota (mega site) - the large octagonal-shaped gun batteries that fire multiple shots at your Solvalou. 
* Grobda (tank) - the tank-like vehicles that travel along the road. They can detect when your bombsight is on them and they will move out of the way.

- TRIVIA -

Xevious was released in December 1982 in Japan.

Xevious is not the world's first vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up but has a huge and lasting influence on the genre.

Xevious was the first game to use pre-rendered graphics and, among its countless innovations, was also the first vertical shoot-em-up that allowed accurate targeting of both airborne and ground-based enemies. The graphics were hugely revolutionary for their time; the sprites were rendered with remarkable clarity and detail due to the game's clever use of colors and shades as well as palette-shifting. Xevious was also the first game to feature 'hidden characters', which, being hidden, are not mentioned in the game's instructions but can be revealed by performing a secret maneuver. Among these was the 'special flag', which gave the player an extra life. This feature was carried over to a number of subsequent Namco games. 

While Xevious enjoyed limited popularity in North America, the game was a huge cult hit in Japan, and to this day is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Popular Japanese musicians, Haruomi Hosono (Yellow Magic Orchestra) and Kuwata Keisuke (Southern All Stars) were known to be fans of the game, and the former produced an album of music from Namco video games, with Xevious as its centerpiece. A follow-up 12-inch single featured in its liner notes an entire science-fiction short story by Endoh, set in the world of Xevious, with even included a rudimentary fictional language. 

At one point in the game, the Solvalou flies over the Nazca lines. The Nazca Lines are geoglyphs (drawings on the ground) located in the Nazca Desert; a high, arid plateau that stretches 37 miles between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, situated in the Pampa region. They were created during the Nazca occupation of the area, between 200 BC and 600 AD. 

The graphic ROMs contain several additional enemies which don't actually appear in gameplay including a silver-grey Galaxian flagship. These enemies do appear in the game-play of "Super Xevious" which uses the same graphics data as Xevious. 

The highest score possible is 9,999,990, at which point the game terminates abnormally and resets. Some time before this score is reached, the game starts to award extra ships on every blaster shot fired. 

Marco Borroni holds the official official record for this game with 7,009,560 points (!) on August 16, 1984. 

The background is actually one large 1024x2048 image. Each of the 16 game areas is a 224x2048 strip starting at a different horizontal offset in the image.

- UPDATES -

* The high-score names are ten characters long on the Namco versions, but only three characters long on the Atari versions. 

* The Zapper and Blaster buttons were reversed between the Japanese and American versions.

- SCORING -

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When you start the game, your Solvalou will be at the bottom of the screen. Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the top and no slower then the bottom of the screen. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick up and down. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control.

* One interesting aspect of this game is the fact if you are too successful against a particular kind of enemy, the game will adjust itself to send different enemies until you have difficulty dealing with them.

* Make sure you know what you will be encountering in each area.

* If you hold down the fire and bomb buttons, you will constantly be doing both at a slower rate. This is great when you are in the thick of things with both air and ground targets swarming the area.

* Speaking of bombs, your Solvalou is equipped with smart bombs (so to speak). They are launch and forget weapons. When you 'paint' the target with your bomb-sight and launch your bomb, it will hit that target even when you have already flown over it. There are a couple of strategies to make your bombing runs more effective:
1) When you have targets close together (usually bomb batteries are arranged this way), put a bomb between them. You will have a very good chance of taking out both batteries with one hit since you can only have one bomb on the screen at a time.
2) For moving targets (such as Grobdas), anticipate the targets direction and 'lead' it a little. This basically means putting the bomb at the point where the target will run into it.
3) Your bomb-sight will turn red whenever any target is 'sighted', even if the target is hidden like Sol Citadels and flags.

* Keep away from the corners. These can become death traps real quickly if you are swamped by enemies.

* Since you have free reign of most of the screen to move around, make sure you use all that room for maneuvering. Enemy fighters have a nasty habit of either shooting from behind your fighter or re-entering the screen from random sides. It also is handy when you are dodging a heavy volume of enemy fire.

* Make sure when you are maneuvering around the Bacuras, you always leave yourself a clear 'out'.  What I mean by this is there another direction to escape instead of having to move along with the Bacuras. An occasional enemy likes to put up shots at your fighter since it is very difficult to maneuver around the rolling plates.

* The Andor Genesis Motherships are pretty easy to destroy if you work quickly. Most of the time, Zakatos and Brag Zakatos precede the arrival of the Andor Genesis Mothership. Blast these out of the sky and avoid the shrapnel. When the Andor Genesis Mothership appears, lead the target a little and quickly move up and plant your bomb at the point the center of the ship will be. The less time you waste taking on this ship, the better.

* Secret Message: The designer of Xevious has included a trick for generating his name right at the beginning of the game. When Solvalou appears, move to the right edge of the screen, wait a few seconds and drop a single bomb as soon as the music changes (after the long note). The message 'Namco ORIGINAL Program by EVEZOO' will appear on the screen.

* THE FLAGS: There are four flags hidden throughout the game. These flags occur in areas 1, 3, 5, and 6. All flags are along a horizontal line across the terrain. The only way to uncover a flag is to bomb it so you will have to lay a string of bombs along the entire horizontal line. This basically means moving up quickly, dealing with enemies quickly, and dropping your bombs quickly. Once a flag is uncovered, you must fly over it to get the benefits from it.

FLAG 1: The first flag is located in the first river you encounter after you start the game. Look for the three Grobdas in a row. Just above them is a river that cuts horizontally across the terrain. Just bomb the river from left to right and around the bank closest to you. The flag should appear.

FLAG 2: After you get past the plates, look up and to the right. There is a little lake with a small river feeding into the ocean. Start in the middle of the lake and bomb toward the little river. The flag should appear around where the river dumps into the ocean.

FLAG 3: When you cross the first ocean, you will eventually see a dock/harbor at the top. The flag is located around the horizontal line that the longest pier projecting out is part of. You will need to quickly bomb that entire length to find and get the flag before the bottom scrolls your Solvalou too far up.

FLAG 4: You will see a big bird picture on the desert. At the lowest point of its tail-feathers (in the lower right corner), start to bomb horizontally from right to left. The flag will appear.

* Sol Citadels: These structures require you to bomb them once to cause them to surface. They look like large storage tanks or grain silos. You then need to bomb them again to destroy them. You have a potential to collect several hundred thousand points by taking out these structures. They come in groups of 1, 4, or 8. Unlike flags, these structures are always in the same place. There are six sets of Sol Citadels.

FIRST SET: One in area 2. When you see the three Grobdas in a row on the road, start laying bombs in the area around the cul-de-sac below the last tank in a right and diagonal-down point. The citadel will be even with the cul-de-sac.

SECOND SET: One in area 3. When you see the Garu Bara, go to the left of the Garu Bara and start bombing. This is also the area that the second flag can be found.

THIRD SET: Four in area 9. There is a clear area right before you tangle with the second Andor Genesis Mothership. Where the road splits around the woods, start to lay bombs a little below the bottom edge of the road that goes to the right. You should uncover four Sol Citadels.

FOURTH SET: Eight in area 13. At the point the desert ends, there is a little grass, then the air field starts. Use the birds leg as a reference and fly straight up. When the bomb-sight glows, start bombing. This will be the lower left Sol Citadel of the group which is arranged in two rows of four citadels. You will be hard pressed to get all eight citadels.

FIFTH SET: Four in area 14. After the plates roll by, look for where two roads merge into one road. At the top edge of the slanted right hand road, start dropping bombs to uncover some more citadels.

SIXTH SET: Four in area 15. Look for a forest on the left side. There will be a small clearing and then a river. Bomb the small clearing to bring the citadels up. There will be very intense ground fire in this location so be especially watchful.

		<name>Yie Ar Kung-Fu</name>
		<desc>Arcade Video game published 37 years ago:

Yie Ar Kung-Fu (c) 1985 Konami Industry Company, Limited.

Yie Ar Kung-fu is a single-player one-on-one fighting game in which the player takes on the role of 'Oolong' who must fight and defeat eleven martial arts masters. His ulimate goal is to win the title of "Grand Master" and honour the memory of his father, who was killed while fighting the current grand master.

The player faces a variety of opponents, each with a unique appearance and fighting style. Some opponents are also armed, with weapons including nunchaku, throwing stars and a club. The player can perform up to 16 different moves using a combination of buttons and joystick movements while standing, crouching or jumping. Moves are thrown at high, middle, and low levels. 

Yie Ar Kung-Fu plays incredibly quickly, with the player having to be constantly on the move to avoid getting 'pegged in' by some of the game's tougher opponents. There is no time limit in which the opponent must be defeated but Oolong possesses a finite amount of health, represented by a health bar at the top of the screen. Once Oolong's health is fully depleted, the match is over.

The first five fights take place in front of an animated waterfall, while the remaining six are set in front of an oriental pagoda. 

The eleven opponents Oolong must face are:
* Buchu - A sumo wrestler, strong but slow.
* Star - The first female opponent, throws shuriken for long-range attacks.
* Nuncha - Uses nunchaku for close and mid-range attacks.
* Pole - Uses a wooden staff for close and mid-range attacks.
* Feedle - Attacks with duplicates of himself.
* Chain - Uses a chain for long-range attacks.
* Club - Uses a large club for close and mid-range attacks.
* Fan - The second female opponent, throws fans for long-range attacks.
* Sword - Uses a sword for close and mid-range attacks.
* Tonfun - Uses tonfa (wooden batons) for close and mid-range attacks.
* Blues - Extremely fast and very powerful.

- TECHNICAL -

Yie Ar Kung-Fu machines came in two upright cabinet forms.

- TRIVIA -

Yie Ar Kung-Fu was released in January 1985.

The words 'Yie Ar' in the title of this game are translated from Chinese as 'One, Two'.

Antonio Colangelo holds the official official record for this game with 534340 points on September 9, 1985.

- SCORING -

Scoring in this game is fairly complex and is dictated by what kind of punch or kick you inflict on your opponent. The more complicated the move, the more points awarded:

Flying High Punch: 500 points.
Jumping High Punch: 2000 points.
Mid-Level Punch: 500 points.
Low Punch: 700 points.
Crouching Mid-Level Punch: 900 points.
Flying High Kick: 600 points.
Jumping High Kick: 2000 points.
Mid-Level Kick: 500 points.
Low Kick: 700 points.
Lying Down High Kick: 900 points.

At the end of each stage, you will receive bonus points by adding your remaining energy x 10 to your score. If you didn't lose any energy on any of the stages one through eight, you get an additional 'Perfect' bonus of that stage number x 10000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When you start the game, there will be a screen that lists the opponents for that block of fighting. The animated opponent is the one Oolong will be currently fighting. You will notice that some opponents have a '???' in a box under their name. This means in order to see this opponent, you must have defeated everyone else up to them. When you exit this screen, Oolong will start on the left and Oolong's opponent will start on the right side of the screen. Once you get through all 11 stages, the cycle begins anew.

* Since there is no time limit on the matches, patience is a must. Latter opponents will take advantage of every mistake made and will 'pin' the player to inflict repeated blows on Oolong.

* Every opponent has some kind of weakness to exploit. Once you learn these weaknesses, they will be much easier to defeat.

* Take advantage of Oolong's mobility. In other words; don't just stand in one place, and never allow Oolong to get trapped on the sides of the screen as this can spell instant defeat in many cases.

* Speaking of mobility, jump around the screen if you don't have a clear opening to strike your opponent. Learn to time and aim your jumps to where you believe your opponent's position will be at. Get in a quick strike and jump away before a counterstrike hits Oolong.

* Your goal on all of the fights is to avoid getting hit. In addition to prevention of energy loss, you can earn bonus points which will eventually add up to an extra life.

* When you get a hit on an opponent, you will see a red marker. If your opponents get a hit, the marker will be either black or yellow.

* Keep in mind that all your opponents know kung-fu. Just because they are wielding a weapon doesn't mean they won't take a punch or kick at Oolong if the opportunity presents itself.

* Below are listed the strategies for defeating your 11 opponents:

STAGE 1: BUCHU:
This is a good introductory fight. Buchu isn't too tough of an opponent and you should be able to take him down without breaking too much of a sweat.

1) Buchu will start the round by flying over to Oolong. When he lands, give him a couple of low sweeping kicks.

2) After taking a couple of hits, Buchu will fly off again in the opposite direction. Just have Oolong jump next to him to deliver either punches or kicks. Buchu will take off again.

3) Follow the above and you should have Buchu crying "Uncle" in no time.

4) Big thing to watch out for is if you stay around him too long, he will deliver a flurry of kicks that will pin Oolong down and eventually take him out. 

STAGE 2: STAR:
Your first fight with a weapon wielding opponent. Star likes to throw shurikens either high, mid-level, or low. They are pretty easy to avoid but do make it a challenge trying to close in on Star.

1) Right after Star throws a shuriken, jump toward him. If you did it right, you should be right next to him to deliver a punch or kick.

2) Quickly jump away and prepare for the next shuriken to be thrown. Again, as above, jump over to Star to deliver some more punishment.

3) Star may jump out of the way but this happens rarely.

4) If you happen to land short, just jump back out of the way since Star will take the advantage and deliver a few kicks Oolong's way.

STAGE 4: NUNCHA:
Now it starts to get interesting. The first opponent that can deliver two to three quick blows when opportunity presents itself. Nuncha is quite effective with his nun-chucks and does some serious damage if you're not ready.

1) Watch for when Nuncha starts to spin his nun-chucks. This means he is preparing to take a shot. Back up and let him advance and then jump over him.

2) He will then take his shot. Be careful in watching where he aims at because he can go high, mid-level, or low. Once he takes his shot, quickly jump over to him to get in a punch or kick. Be aware, he may block a couple of your moves with his nun-chucks.

3) Jump away quickly since he will again start spinning his nun-chucks. If you stay to long next to him, he will deliver two or three shots to pin down Oolong before Oolong can escape.

4) Continue moving around and soon Nuncha will be history.

STAGE 4: POLE:
Pole is another one of those opponents who can put a major hurting on your character real quick if you're not careful. He also tends to move around a lot making it more difficult to hit him.

1) He will start off by spinning the pole above his head. If Oolong gets too close, Pole will take a couple of shots at him. The best offensive is to jump to a position you believe Pole will be at since he moves around a lot.

2) You won't have time to dally once you are next to Pole. Get in a low shot and jump out of there quickly or Oolong will meet the business end of the pole real quickly. Pole will then again spin the pole above his head and advance on Oolong. Jump over and try to hit Pole from the backside.

3) Continue to jump over Pole and get in low shots. You should have him begging for mercy in no time.

STAGE 5: FEEDLE:
This is actually a series of the same opponent instead of one. This is kind of your breather before entering the second part of the tournament.

1) Feedle(s) will enter from both the left and right side of the screen. Your character will be in the middle. They only do basic moves of mid-level kicks and punches.

2) They will continue to enter from either side of the screen so you may need to move back and forth to be able to turn around rapidly to deal with the threat from both sides. Low kicks will suffice to eliminate Feedle.

3) You have to eliminate eight Feedle(s) in order to win the match. Feedle(s) will keep feeding onto the screen until you achieve that objective.

4) Do not jump on this stage or you may get yourself into trouble since there isn't much space in the line of Feedle(s) coming after your character.

STAGE 6: CHAIN:
Chain is a difficult opponent unless you can move around quickly.

1) Chain starts this off by slinging his chain at Oolong. It has a limited range and it can be aimed high, mid-level, or low. The bad part about this is that even when the chain is going back to Chain, Oolong can still take a hit.

2) Once Chain fires his chain, you need to make sure that you aim Oolong to jump over Chain and get real close. If you don't, Chain turns very quickly and will launch another attack if you aren't close enough to attack him. Only do low hits to minimize your chances of getting hit by his chain. Once you get in a hit, jump back to get out of range of his chain.

3) You will also have to watch out for his low kicks if you are too far away and he doesn't use his chain.

4) Continue to jump around and get in hits and eventually you will delink him.

STAGE 7: CLUB:
Club likes to act aggressive and so will advance on Oolong immediately. This is his downfall.

1) Let Club advance on Oolong. When he gets close to his striking distance, jump over him to land next to him on the other side. Deliver a couple of low kicks or punches. You may have to jump up to avoid his club.

2) Jump to the other side of the screen and let him advance on Oolong again. This time, after you jump, watch his movements. He may back up onto the side. If this happens, just jump back away and let him advance again. To really mess with him, do a small jump away from him then immediately jump to his other side.

3) Do the above a few times and club will be no more.

STAGE 8: FAN:
As the opponents name implies, Fan likes to throw razor-sharp fans at Oolong.

1) She will start this stage by launching three fans at Oolong. They start high and have an uncanny ability to track Oolong (to a degree). This is also one of the few weapons that Oolong can actually counter with punches or kicks (it is hard though to get lined up).

2) Once she launches her fans, wait until the last fan gets low enough to jump over. Then jump next to her to deliver some punches and kicks. You should be able to get in two hits before you have to bounce out again. Watch out if you aren't close enough since she likes to deliver a few kicks of her own.

3) Continue to maneuver around her. You may not get in a shot after every jump but she does leave openings that can be easily exploited.

4) You will eventually send her crashing down like her fans.

STAGE 9: SWORD:
This actually is one of the easier opponents to deal with. All he does is slide along the ground waiting to put a sword through Oolong.

1) Sword actually is one of the quicker opponents. He has a tendency to hit and run. Basically, if he hits Oolong, he quickly goes the opposite direction. Much quicker then Oolong can jump after him. This means you have to keep him on the defensive.

2) Get into position and jump so you are next to Sword. Do a quick low punch or kick. Sword will rapidly retreat, then advance. When he is within striking distance, hit or punch again. Sword will again retreat. This cycle should continue until Sword is skewered.

3) You may have to jump out of Sword's range if you mess up the cycle. Just repeat the above steps to get back into a rhythm again.

STAGE 10: TONFUN:
Your next two opponents will test your skills to the utmost.

1) Tonfun has it all: Speed, quick attack, and aggressiveness. This means you will be moving around a whole lot to avoid his hits.

2) First of all, avoid the sides of the screen. Tonfun likes to crowd the sides and pin Oolong down. This means you will be doing a lot of jumping around. In addition, he has the nasty habit of blocking a lot of your attacks.

3) Hit and run is the name of the game here. This means you will have to jump over him, spin around, get in a low attack, and jump back before he counter-attacks very quickly. If you hesitate on any of these, Tonfun will have fun giving Oolong a couple of shots which knock down the energy bar significantly.

4) You may have to do a lot of jumps before you can even get in a hit on Tonfun. Expect this to be a long fight.

STAGE 11: BLUES:
Blues is a worthy opponent for the final match. He is very quick and can put Oolong down in just a few hits. Plus, he likes to jump around the screen. This is the ultimate test of skill.

1) Blues will immediately jump over to Oolong to deliver a few hits. This means you need to be constantly jumping around and looking for an opening. Unfortunately, Blues leaves very few openings to exploit.

2) Do not, under any circumstance, have Oolong hang out at the sides. Blues will trap Oolong and deliver enough punches and kicks to keep Oolong pinned down so you can't even jump. A quick way to end a stage with a defeat.

3) Also, don't even attempt to go "toe-to-toe" with Blues since he is much quicker then Oolong in the delivery of attacks. Use the tried-and-tested method of hit and run. This time, you have to be sure of your shot. If you miss, or if Blues blocks Oolongs attack, be prepared for a major counter-attack if you don't move out of the way in time. This means you need to basically attack and jump back at the same practical moment.

4) Blues also will jump around the screen when Oolong does. This makes it very difficult to pinpoint a position that Blues may be in. In addition, Blues can quickly move out of Oolong's attack range if Oolong isn't quick enough, or get behind Oolong to deliver a few blows of his own.

5) This battle will last a while Oolong and Blues jockey for position to deliver their hits. Unfortunately, skill and luck both are factors in this battle. Just do the above steps to tip the balance in your favor.

After defeating Blues, the game will start again at the first stage.
