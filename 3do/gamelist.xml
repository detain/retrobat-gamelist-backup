		<name>Fun 'n' Games</name>
		<desc>This version of Fun 'N Games is a bit different from this version of the game. The paint, music, and style portion of this game are basically the same as the other version of the game, so the main difference is that there are a few more and different games in this version. 

The games included are:


"Max &amp; Maxine" is a Pac-Man  type game in which the player controls a mouse trying to collect all the cheese in the maze while avoiding getting hit by enemies. If the mouse eats a power up, it doubles in size and can now eat the enemies for a limited amount of time before it returns to normal size.
"Space Cadet" has the player shooting enemies from the cockpit of a spaceship.
"Aquashark" is a typical horizontal shoot-em up with the setting of the oceans of the future.
"Whereabouts" is the typical memory match game where the player flips over cards trying to match them to other flipped over cards.
"Sliding Puzzle" lets the player choose a picture to get scrambled and it's up to the player to slide the tiles into the correct positions to get the picture complete again.</desc>

		<name>Sesame Street : Numbers</name>
		<desc>This game is meant to help children learn basic math skills such as simple addition and learning to count. The player controls a star that can scroll over interactive objects. Most objects that are clicked on give the player a short animation sequence. The game also contains radios and television sets, that when selected, let the player listen to songs and watch animated clips from the television series, respectively. The game features over an hour of footage from the television series, including songs about numbers. There is also a phone which the player can use to call a muppet and books that are read to the player.

There are also a few games that can be played by visiting each muppets residence. The games include the Present Game, the Paper Clip Game, the Near and Far Game, and "I've Got Your Number."

In the Present Game, players help collect a certain number of requested presents for Elmo.

In the Paper Clip Game, players are challenged to find Bert's paper clip collection by following clues given by Ernie.

The Near and Far Game is played with Big Bird. He hides an object on the player, and then the player selects an object and Big Bird says whether the object is close or far.

In "I've Got Your Number.", the Count gives the player a simple math problem, and the player must select the correct answer.</desc>

		<name>Alone In The Dark</name>
		<desc>Jeremy Hartwood has committed suicide in his Louisiana mansion, Derceto. You take the role of either Edward Carnby, a private investigator, or Emily Hartwood, Jeremy's niece, and investigate the suspicious death. The three-floor mansion is reputed to be haunted by its eccentric past owner. Very quickly, you realise that it is. Warped rats, zombies and giant worms are among the foes who are after you, and you must somehow escape. 

Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models. 

To escape the mansion, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place. Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons. 

Weapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.</desc>

		<name>Alone In The Dark 2</name>
		<desc>In Alone in the Dark 2, you take the role of detective Edward Carnby, one of the two main characters in the original Alone in the Dark. Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.

Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).

Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. 

Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery. 

Apart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight, and thus the sections featuring her are all about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. 

The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. 

Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.</desc>

		<name>Battlesport</name>
		<desc>Battlesport simulates the sport of the future. Choose your vehicle and enter the arena to face your computer opponents to see who scores the most goals before the clock runs out.

Scoring isn't easy. The ball constantly bounces over the arena, retrieved by a player constantly bombarded by opponents. A variety of weapons are available to shoot your competitor, and anyone that takes a hit while carrying the ball loses possession, sending the ball bouncing across the arena. Taking too many shots results in a temporary inability to take part in the action while your opponent happily scores goals.

Winning matches increases standing in the rankings and the acquisition of cash to purchase a better vehicle and enhanced offensive or defensive items.</desc>

		<desc>In Braindead 13, the player takes on the role of a young computer expert who one day is called to fix a computer at some scary castle and in no time flat, finds himself in trouble.

It is up to the player to use the complex moves of an interactive movie to escape from the castle. This animated adventure is basically based on the player's judgment on which direction you think the character might go, and if the player guesses wrong, death.</desc>

		<name>Burning Soldier</name>
		<desc>A first-person space shooter, similar to Shock Wave and Total Eclipse, that has the player take control of a state of the art Strike fighter in missions ranging from the asteroid belt to the final fight on the Earth's surface. This is all done in an attempt to stop the Kaisertian (which resemble the Aliens from the Alien movies) race from destroying mankind.

The gameplay is very simplistic. The player uses the D-pad to move around a cursor on the screen, to aim wherever the player wants the weapons to fire, and the main buttons to fire the two main weapons of choice, a Laser Vulcan Cannon and a Blast Smash that is guided automatically at incoming enemies. However, unlike other first-person space shooters for the 3DO, there is no way of controlling the actual ship as its' movement is on a predetermined course and can't be manually deviated. The story is told through CGI cinemas.</desc>

		<desc>Bust-A-Move (also known as Puzzle Bobble) is a real-time puzzle game in which the player controls a device called "pointer" at the bottom of the screen, aiming and releasing randomly colored bubbles upwards. Depending on the aiming, the bubbles may float up directly or bounce off the walls, changing their trajectory. The goal is to aim the bubbles in such a way that they will touch identically colored ones. When such bubbles form a group of three or more, they pop and disappear from the screen.</desc>

You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once).</desc>

		<name>Creature Shock</name>
		<desc>The earth is overpopulated and mankind must find a second home. The spaceship Amazon is sent to investigate Saturn and Jupiter for possible colonization. Near the end of its mission, all contact is lost with the ship except for a distress beacon. The player is part of the crew sent to the Amazon's last known location to find out what happened.

Creature Shock is a first-person shooter with Full Motion Video and arcade-like elements. Aliens of all sizes and types will try to destroy the team, but each one has a weak point that can be exploited. The fighting takes place on the surface of asteroids and within mazes of passageways underground. 

There are also two 3D sections where the player gets to pilot the ship.</desc>

		<name>Crime Patrol</name>
		<desc>Crime Patrol puts the player in the shoes of a police officer, who starts as a Rookie and has to work his way up to become a member of SWAT and eventually the Delta Force team. To do that, he has to complete missions, which involve taking down criminals in a variety of locations. Beginning with smaller-scale criminals (such as shoplifters), the hero will later have to face gangsters, drug lords, and eventually terrorists. For each set of missions, the player characters is being teamed up with another police officer. The gameplay is quite similar to any other of the large live-action laser-gun games found in the arcades - all the player has to do is take the gun (or the mouse in the computer version) and show those criminals who's the boss!</desc>

		<name>D</name>
		<desc>D is basically an adventure game in which the player controlled main character Laura Harris, who must find out why her father has gone on a murderous rampage and is holding hostages in a hospital. The game uses pre-generated computer graphics and full motion video to tell its story. The player has two hours to solve the mystery of why Laura's father went on his bloody maasacre. The player manipulates the Laura character from both a first person and third person perspectives.

The game has several endings, a time's up ending, a good and bad ending, and a 100% completion ending. The ending a player witnessed was based on their actions throughout the game. The 100% complete ending includes the good ending and the addition of the sounds of a newborn baby crying. Some players inexplicably concluded that this sound of a baby crying meant that the visibly not pregnant Laura gave birth at the end of the game, a storyline development that some misguidedly believed would lead directly into the sequel, D2.</desc>

		<name>The Daedalus Encounter</name>
		<desc>The interstellar war is over, leaving you, a casualty, as a disembodied brain inside a life support system. Your buddies rescue you from the lab so that you can go exploring - scavenging the galaxy for wreckage and artifacts left over from the war. In due course you stumble literally into an alien craft. With your own craft disabled, and the alien ship on a collision course, you must explore it to find out what has gone wrong and to make a course correction. 

Gameplay consists of conversations with your colleagues (displayed as live action video), animated exploration sequences, as well as puzzle-solving that mostly involves figuring out how to operate alien mechanisms. There is also a maze sequence and sporadic action-based tasks. There is no inventory to speak of, because, being a brain in a box. you have no pockets.

All the action takes place in an in-game window that is your view of the world. It takes up only a small part of the screen and the rest of the screen is taken up with a kind of fleshy 'inside of your head' background that is there to remind you that you are inside a machine. Three difficulty settings, in-game instruction and assistance, as well as a few extras (such as high-resolution pictures) are included.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : DeathKeep</name>
		<desc>Deathkeep is a 1st person perspective single-player "shooter" game with a touch of medieval AD&amp;D gameplay in a full 3D environment.
Gameplay consists mostly of adventuring and flattening every living and non-living creature in your way. Destroying monsters allows the character to level-up and become more powerful as well as gain new spells. The dungeons are filled with traps, streams, caverns, ledges, and every possible obstacle to cause the player to lose their way in this maze of mazes.</desc>

		<desc>There are three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard. The game is broken up into levels, which divides up the gameplay style as not all the levels are played the same. Levels are mostly first person rail shooter segments, although some levels are not on rails and are similar to Doom. The 3DO Gamegun is supported for the rail shooter segments. One-on-one fighting levels are similar to Mortal Kombat, in that they feature digitized sprites viewed from a side perspective. There is also a driving segment near the end of the game. Due to the advanced 3DO sound engine, the soundtrack is ripped directly from the movie, and full motion video both from the movie and exclusive to the game are also included.</desc>

It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.</desc>

Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</desc>

There are three modes to choose from: Exhibition where the player can choose any boxer to fight another, or the player can choose any of Ali's historic fights to play, Tournament where a player fights a series of boxers in an 8 man tournament tree to become champion and Career Mode, where the player can only play as Muhammed Ali and fight the other boxers in order as he did in real life.

Players fight opponents with the basic punch moves, jabs, uppercuts and hooks along with defensive moves like blocking and grabbing. Fatigue is not simulated, but players can slow down their opponents after a series of large successful hits along with bruises, blooded and black eyes.

There are 21 different camera views to choose from, including first-person that will react to their fighters being hit (ex. if a player keeps getting hit in the eyes, the screen will start to blacken, simulating a swollen eye and if they take a hard enough punch they will actually see the game through double vision). Championship photos of each boxer is also show before a fight and commentary is provided by Tim Gammon.</desc>

RPG elements are fairly standard with hit points, magic points, speed, mobility, skills, etc.  Each golem type has specific abilities, for example Priest is strong in Light Magic whereas Archer is strong in arrow attacks.  General movement is done on the World map which is divided into Fields and player is able to see which Fields are occupied by the enemy.  Shops are only accessible on the World map.  Selecting a Field takes the group of golems into a Field map which is presented in pseudo-3D.

Player can freely travel the Field map, finding treasures and other items, periodically bumping into enemy groups.  Battles are fought in turns on the same map, there is no separate battle screen.  Movement is into main compass directions only and the player controls the whole group when travelling.  Only during battle are each group member individually controllable.</desc>

		<name>Immercenary</name>
		<desc>In the future, mankind has been enslaved in a virtual reality simulation known as Perfect. This simulation is controlled by an entity known as Perfect1 and it has to be destroyed in order to shut down the system. You are Immercenary Number Five, and it's your job to do it. 

From a secret lab you log into the simulation which sends you to a place in Perfect known as the Garden. Every entity in the game has a certain rank that determines its offensive and defensive capabilities. You start at 255, the lowest rank, and must rise in ranks to defeat Perfect1, who holds rank number 1. To do so, you destroy higher-ranked Rithms, as the other entities in the game are called. To pass beyond certain ranks, unique Rithms high in the Perfect hierarchy have to be destroyed.

Different weapons and power-ups can be collected and spent offensive and defensive energy can be recharged at energy spires. In the center of the Garden is a place called DOAsys, which functions as a neutral zone and healing center. There you can talk to other Rithms and ask for hints about combating special Rithms and where to find special items. These dialogue sequences take the form of live action clips of actors in elaborate costumes playing the Rithms.

When the player logs out of the simulation or is violently forced out, he returns to the lab where one may load and save a game and access detailed statistics on the trips to Perfect.</desc>

		<name>The Incredible Machine</name>
		<desc>The Incredible Machine is a puzzle game where the player has to assemble a Rube Goldberg-type contraption to solve a simple puzzle. 

The game consists of a series of puzzles, each having a simple objective, such as "put the baseball into the basket" or "turn on the fan". To achieve this, the player is given a number of parts such as: balls, girders, rope, balloons, seesaws, cats or monkeys, and his job is to arrange and connect them on the playfield, so that, upon clicking the "start puzzle" button, the whole contraption activates and achieves the objective. 

For added difficulty, some puzzles have different gravity or air pressure from that of Earth. 

There is also a freeform mode where the player is given an unlimited number of parts to construct a machine of his own invention. The machines created this way can be saved to disk.</desc>

After his showdown with the Scientist and the Android, Tetsujin finds himself disembodied. A mysterious corporation known as SCR gives you a new body, but their plans for your are mysterious.

The format of this game is mostly similar to the first. This is a first person shooter that relies heavily on video cutscenes to tell a story. The graphics engine has been improved greatly, giving this game a much faster pace than it's predecessor. Whereas the original used a combination of live actors and CG, this one uses CG to depict the humans as well.</desc>

		<name>Johnny Bazookatone</name>
		<desc>The original guitar hero with the Elvis attitude and purple hair pompadour, Johnny Bazookatone, has been imprisoned in the year 2050 in Sin Sin Prison by El Diablo, the Lord of the Underworld, who is jealous of his talent and kidnaps other musical legends as well in this 3D side-scrolling platformer.  Johnny's guitar Anita has been taken from him and he sets out to escape and vanquish foes on his way to be reunited with Anita. 

He can perform moves such as 360-degree spin jumps, and hover jumps among others, while using his bazooka guitar as a weapon.  When powered up, it can emit a special sonic blast that fries anything within hearing range. As you make your way through the demonic levels such as Hotel Demonique, Hell's Kitchen, and Mr. Diablo's fiery Penthouse, you can  acquire more weapons, power-ups and find secret passages that lead to bonus levels. The game's soundtrack includes the title track contributed by Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora and Tico Torres.</desc>

		<name>Jurassic Park Interactive</name>
		<desc>Based on its namesake film, Jurassic Park Interactive places you as a park security guard and tasks you with guiding five to eleven visitors (based on the skill level you chose) to the safety of the helipad. You select each visitor from an overhead map, and must play one of three randomly-selected minigames to determine if they successfully make it to the next safe house:

- "Spitter Shoot" is a shooting gallery with Dilophosaurs as the targets. You use a stun gun which must be charged up to have maximum effect. Docile dinos also mix with the hostile ones, but turn hostile if shot unnecessarily.

- "T-Rex Chase" is a basic driving game where you must outrun a Tyranosaurus (visible in your rear-view mirror) while simultaneously staying on the road and dodging hazards.

- "Raptor Maze" is a 3D, first-person game where you must escape a darkened building while being stalked by Velociraptors of increasing numbers. You have no weapons, and must instead use gates to block the dinos and alternate pathways to slip by.

You must also hack computer locks to allow you access to the communications systems. Each lock is yet another minigame; these based off of arcade classics (Space Invaders, Asteroids) with dinosaurs and Jurassic Park characters.

Your final rating is given based on your success in both areas.</desc>

Though Killing Time is graphically a typical Doom clone, there are some differences: the game has one huge level instead of many smaller ones which allows you to return to old places at any time, i.e. to pick up health packs or ammunition. Also the spirits of Tess and her guests appear occasionally and bring the story of that evening to light helping you to find keys, to unlock doorways, to locate secret passages and to solve puzzles.

Killing Time was originally developed for the 3DO, and was later converted to the PC.</desc>

		<name>Lost Eden</name>
		<desc>Lost Eden is an adventure game set on an eerie planet populated with dinosaurs.

Your civilisation is menaced. Armies of Tyranns, led by Moorkus Rex, are gathering around your kingdom. Soon they will swarm in, destroy everything and kill your people. However, there is a single hope. There are legends telling that several hundreds of years ago, men and dinosaurs cooperated to build 5 mighty Citadels that were almost invulnerable to the Tyranns. Today, all the Citadels but one have been destroyed.

You play as Adam of Mo, you must rediscover the secret of uniting men and dinosaurs, rebuild the Citadels, and finally defeat Morkus Rex and his armies.

Lost Eden is a first-person adventure that utilizes  Myst-style navigation through pre-rendered backgrounds that represent locations. However, the gameplay is less heavy on environment-manipulating puzzle-solving than Myst, having more in common with traditional adventure games with their inventory-based puzzles.</desc>

		<name>Lost Eden</name>
		<desc>Lost Eden is an adventure game set on an eerie planet populated with dinosaurs.

Your civilisation is menaced. Armies of Tyranns, led by Moorkus Rex, are gathering around your kingdom. Soon they will swarm in, destroy everything and kill your people. However, there is a single hope. There are legends telling that several hundreds of years ago, men and dinosaurs cooperated to build 5 mighty Citadels that were almost invulnerable to the Tyranns. Today, all the Citadels but one have been destroyed.

You play as Adam of Mo, you must rediscover the secret of uniting men and dinosaurs, rebuild the Citadels, and finally defeat Morkus Rex and his armies.

Lost Eden is a first-person adventure that utilizes  Myst-style navigation through pre-rendered backgrounds that represent locations. However, the gameplay is less heavy on environment-manipulating puzzle-solving than Myst, having more in common with traditional adventure games with their inventory-based puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Serrated Scalpel is a verb-based point-and-click graphic adventure game.

London, 1888. Sherlock Holmes, the world’s most famous private investigator, and his faithful companion Dr. Watson, are called to the scene of a gruesome crime: a young actress has been murdered in an alley behind her theatre. Not surprisingly, Scotland Yard’s Inspector Lestrade is clueless. Was it the work of the Ripper? Sherlock Holmes is not so sure -- the circumstantial evidence indicates a much more intricate crime. The shrewd detective begins the hunt.

The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes is a classical crime story with two protagonists. In the role of Sherlock Holmes, you travel through London in the search for clues. Interesting locations are gradually added to a city map. Your most important source of information are dialogues with suspects, witnesses and other people – and with Dr. Watson, who will readily comment on the situation. When talking to persons, you may chose one of several lines that seems most appropriate. Watson notes down all conversations in his journal, where you can access them if needed. True to the novels, Holmes will solve many puzzles through sharp observations and thorough searches of every location (thus discovering clues and deducing connections) as well as clever interrogations.

Readers of the Sherlock Holmes stories will recognize many acquaintances, from Lestrade to Miss Hudson, from Inspector Gregson to Toby the hound. The game's introduction, cutscenes and ending feature digitized speech.</desc>

Lucienne’s Quest is a game in classic roleplaying genre, but presented in full 3D graphics (and sprite characters) uncommon for the time. The battles are fought in traditional turn-based manner, but allow for more strategy than most classic RPGs. The game places ambient obstacles on the battlefield to block some attack paths, but allows the player to strategically reposition his fighters along the bottom two rows of the map before every turn to take advantage of the terrain.
The game also features a dynamic day/night system which serves little purpose other than changing one of your party members from human into a werewolf and back.</desc>

		<desc>Mag Dog McCree and his gang have kidnapped the Mayor and his daughter, and its up to you to rescue them. You must blast through bars and bank robberies to take the gang out and save everything you regard as good and true. Where the game differed from other Operation Wolf-influenced shoot 'em ups was in the use of live video, with real people appearing on the screen before you shoot them down. You have unlimited continues with which to reach the end, so the actors will have their screen deaths seen by as many people as they would had they starred in a film.</desc>

		<desc>In Mazer, the player can choose from one of four soldiers tasked with freeing Earth from the oppressive rule of an alien race known as the Semag-Resal, who have a network of bases located all over Earth.  To make matters worse, they have developed cyborgs that can perfectly mimic human beings that can infiltrate their rebel hideouts and exterminate them.

The gameplay is similar to Project Overkill in some respects with the view being isometric and the main goal of the game is to wipe out any alien life form within the bases and free human captives to receive bonuses.  As the player progresses, the enemies will become more numerous and harder to kill with the final boss of the game being a giant alien robot.</desc>

		<name>Microcosm</name>
		<desc>In the year 2051, two mega corporations battle it out for supremacy over an overcrowded, overpolluted planet.  CyberTech Industries, the dominant company on the planet, is being challenged by Axiom, who blames the former for their president's death.  To gain revenge, they secretly inject CyberTech's president, Anton Korsby, with a virus that threatens to take over his body, and ultimately destroy himself and CyberTech. Your mission is to enter Korsby's body, destroy the virus, and defeat the organism that controls his brain.

Microcosm is a 3D action shooter, similar to Descent, that takes place entirely within the human body. The concept was inspired by the 1966 movie Fantastic Voyage. The player pilots his way through various parts of the anatomy, blasting virii and enemy ships, while gaining power-ups and faster, stronger craft. The goal of the game is to eventually reach the brain to stop Grey M, the entity that controls Korsby's body.

Microcosm makes heavy use of full-motion video and features high-resolution fractal graphics (to simulate the walls of veins and arteries), digital music and sound effects.</desc>

This picture can either be made into a jigsaw puzzle, a slider puzzle, or a memory match game where when each card is matched and disappears more of the background picture is revealed. Completing any of these three puzzles unlocks a softcore pornographic clip from a Vivid Video movie.</desc>

		<name>Myst</name>
		<desc>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</desc>

		<name>Night Trap</name>
		<desc>Five girls go to a party to a nice house on a lakeside. Five girls disappear without a trace... Now another five girls go there, in order to spend the vacation with the Martins, the owners of the house, in particular with the lovely Ms. Martin. This time, you should not let them die a gruesome death! Because "nice people" can sometimes turn out to be... yes, that's right - vampires. The whole house is full of traps, that are intended to catch the poor innocent girls, so that the vampires can suck their blood... ugh. Luckily, the brave adventurer is there in order to cease to be hunted and to become a hunter instead! Set the traps so that they will capture the villains themselves, using precise timing and good organization.

Night Trap was the very first game that used the FMV (full-motion video) technology with live actors. Although it didn't contain nudity or particularly gory scenes, it was considered one of the first games to have a mature content.</desc>

		<desc>Five girls go to a party to a nice house on a lakeside. Five girls disappear without a trace... Now another five girls go there, in order to spend the vacation with the Martins, the owners of the house, in particular with the lovely Ms. Martin. This time, you should not let them die a gruesome death! Because "nice people" can sometimes turn out to be... yes, that's right - vampires. The whole house is full of traps, that are intended to catch the poor innocent girls, so that the vampires can suck their blood... ugh. Luckily, the brave adventurer is there in order to cease to be hunted and to become a hunter instead! Set the traps so that they will capture the villains themselves, using precise timing and good organization.

		<desc>You play a Trashman, a bounty hunter paid to capture criminal scum hiding on harsh alien worlds. 

Your job is to race the enemy crime boss to the finish, blasting his goons along the way. Get blown up or drive too slowly and the boss gets away. But if you make it to the check point in time, you block the boss' escape and trap him on the planet.

You can upgrade your vehicle with the cash from your bounties. You can also go up against a buddy in the vertical split-screen deathmatch mode.

Off-World Interceptor's most unique feature is the storyline, told in full-motion video. Standard for the time. But OWIE's FMV is mocked by a couple of guys sitting in chairs, a la Mystery Science Theater 3000.</desc>

		<name>Out of this World</name>
		<desc>Another World (Out of This World in the US) combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. The game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.

Typically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. The gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. By pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield which protects Lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. Finally, by holding the fire button even longer the player creates powerful bombs which can disrupt shields. Most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as Lester. Fighting enemies therefore requires tactical usage of regular attacks, shields, and bombs, as well as learning enemy patterns.</desc>

		<desc>If you've ever thought of what it feels like to be the ball in a pinball machine, playing PaTaank might give you some idea.  Instead of flapping the flippers, the player controls the ball, or in PaTaank, a UFO-shaped puck around the three different tables.  The tables are named Surf Room, Luv Room, and Disaster Room and they are connected to each other via Nexus.  Player can choose to play one room or in the MetaGame mode, all of them in sequence.  Each room has an objective and in the MetaGame mode, player must reach that objective to advance into the next room via the Nexus.

Like any pinball, there are targets, tunnels, blocks, and all sorts of flashing things that increase the score, light up letters, or grant bonus items.  In addition to inertial control of the puck, player can apply thrust, which is limited, and activate magnetos, which are scattered around the room.</desc>

		<name>The Perfect General</name>
		<desc>This military strategy game involves the Blue Army fighting the Red Army. The game contains both a Campaign mode and a Tournament mode. In the Campaign mode, the player fights through various maps completing missions. The player is giving a certain amount of funds to be spent on purchasing troops and vehicles. Once the units are placed on the map, the player is given a turn where they can move their units and fire on any opposing forces. Movement is done on a hex based grid.

The Tournament mode is the equivalent of an exhibition mode. The player can choose to play against the computer, another player, or even just watch the computer play itself. In this mode, the player is also given the option to set certain parameters and choose what map to fight on.

There is also a bonus game which is like an 8-player version of Bomberman with tanks.</desc>

		<name>PGA Tour 96</name>
		<desc>PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).

The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.

Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</desc>

		<desc>Phoenix 3 is a sci-fi adventure with two completely different game play styles.  Half the game is a slow paced side-scrolling shooter, the other half is 3D space combat, similar to Wing Commander.

Phoenix 3 features live-action video cutscenes that unfold the story.  Most of the game takes place on the planet Galearth.  Galearth has been at peace for centuries, but is now threatened by alien invaders known as the Gral.  It is up to you, Derek Freeman, to uncover an ancient weapon known as the Talon that can defeat the Gral.</desc>

		<name>Quarterback Attack - The Professional Quarterback Simulator</name>
		<desc>In this semi-fmv game you play a rookie facing his first game as starting quarterback on a fictional team, and this just happens to be The Big Game.

The entire game consists of this confrontation, upon start of the game you watch a video of a kickoff and return, and then you get to select among 110 plays (100 passing and 10 running) and assing a snap count. The meat of the game is on the passing plays, were you are switched to a 3rd person behind-the-quarterback view from which you can see oncoming rushers as well as zoom in on any receiver and via a targeting cursor make passes, or scramble if you don't find any open man, etc.</desc>

		<name>Rise Of The Robots</name>
		<desc>Rise of the Robots is a 2.5D fighting game. You play as the cyborg Eco35-2, half-man half-robot, created by the Electrocorp company, in order to counter the mutiny that is brewing in their Metropolis 4 factory, following the reprogramming of certain robots by injecting them with the EGO virus, making them aware of their situation and therefore aggressive. You will have to fight them one by one in duel battles to stop this rebellion.
The title was intended to be graphically revolutionary. But although the fighting robots are quite nice (with 3D sprites transcribed in a 2D universe), the scenery is only in dull static 2D. Also, the in-game animation is slow, even quite "heavy", directly impacting the handling. 
The slowness of your robot and the varying power of the enemies (to the point that some robots are ultra powerful and atomize you in two shots) quickly make the fights unbalanced.</desc>

		<name>Road Rash</name>
		<desc>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. 

There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.

There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.

If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.

The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</desc>

		<name>Robinson's Requiem</name>
		<desc>In the far future humanity has achieved faster-than-light space travel, but the galaxy is still a big unknown place. To chart the stars and planets explorers named "Robinsons" are sent on scouting tours of duty. Most of the time the Robinsons sent away are individuals deemed dangerous to society and whose ships are sabotaged.

You play one of these Robinsons who gets stranded on a mysterious alien planet on which a telepathic woman is also stranded. As it turns out she knows a way to get off the planet, but she needs your help to escape.

Gameplay consists of first person roleplaying with the emphasis placed on character modeling and survival. Take a dip when it's cold and you'll sure catch the flu, don't treat an infected injury and amputation is on the way, etc. You must fashion your own tools from whatever you can find on the planet and the game uses pre-rendered sprites over voxel technology terrain for graphics.</desc>

		<desc>Seal of the Pharaoh is a mix of RPG, puzzle-solving and first-person adventuring.  The player takes control of the son of a prominent archaeologist, who has recently discovered the long lost tomb of Rassius III, and has gone missing. It is now up to the player to find him by exploring the tomb, but at the same time avoid the various traps and enemies laid out before them.

The perspective is from a first-person view as they progress through the maze-like pyramid equipped with a club, a shield and a diary.  As they progress they must avoid traps, but also use their club and shield to take out enemies such as giant wasps, scorpions and even haunted urns.  More powerful weapons and items can be obtained through further exploration as well as clues to decipher the diary and various puzzles that need to be solved in order to advance.</desc>

		<desc>Sewer Shark is an FMV-based shooter, and one of the first games released for the Sega CD. You move a crosshair around the screen and shoot targets. Occasionally, you can also choose to change directions at fixed points.

Of course the real attraction in a game like this is the story. In the future, maybe in the year 2000, people will be forced to move underground and live in tunnels. Unfortunately, these tunnels are infested with mutated rat / alligator creatures known as "ratigators." You are pilot of a Sewer Shark, a craft designed to navigate the Sewers and rid them of ratigators. It's a dangerous job, but if you clear out enough vermin you can win a one-way trip to Solar City and sunny beaches.</desc>

These must be removed by matching pairs, but only tiles which are visible and have a space to the left or right can be removed.

This release in the Activision's Shanghai series includes three games along with the Classic Shanghai. In The Great Wall, the tiles are stacked vertically, and fall when lower tiles are removed, a lÃ¡ Tetris. In Beijing, gaps are created to slide groups of tiles along. The Golden Tile sees two players attempt to clear a set layout at once. The Triple-theme continues with three game modes: Solitaire, 2-player "Pandamonium", and Arcade.

		<desc>It has been twenty years since the invading aliens have been driven back through the jumpgate. On a planet close to the dormant gate, an alien artifact is found. When unknown aliens steal the artifact, privateer Captain Flint of the spaceship Cortez and his crew follow their ship through the jumpgate, which leaves them stranded in an unknown star system. To find their way back, they have to find the artifact and the aliens. You take control of Flint. Aboard the Cortez, you can receive messages from your crew members, scan the planets in the system for possible mission sites and select suitable weapons and equipment for the next mission. Three different craft are available for the missions: a fighter, a hovercraft and a stationary turret used to give cover to your crew mates when they are on a mission. After completed missions, the wreckage from destroyed aliens is analyzed and used to produce better weapons and equipment. The storyline will take you through six different systems, each with a variety of missions to complete. Live-action cut-scenes continue the story.</desc>

To find their way back, they have to find the artifact and the aliens. You take control of Flint. Aboard the Cortez, you can receive messages from your crew members, scan the planets in the system for possible mission sites and select suitable weapons and equipment for the next mission. Three different craft are available for the missions: a fighter, a hovercraft and a stationary turret used to give cover to your crew mates when they are on a mission. After completed missions, the wreckage from destroyed aliens is analyzed and used to produce better weapons and equipment. The storyline will take you through six different systems, each with a variety of missions to complete. Live-action cut-scenes continue the story.</desc>

		<desc>Slam 'N Jam '95 is a game similar in style to the arcade game Run &amp; Gun and NBA Jam, with a five-on-five team game in a 3-D style perspective.  The gameplay is geared towards more of an arcade feel rather than simulation and does not feature any NBA license but resembles actual teams and modeled after top players of the time.

It also features the obligatory modes such as Exhibition, Playoffs and Season and the ability to let friends go head-to-head.  Then CNN sportscaster Van Earl Wright lends his voice talents to the game for in game commentary.</desc>

		<desc>Aliens attempting to steal the World Cup have crashed as they tried to flee, and the Cup has been broken, its pieces scattered around the globe. As Soccer Kid, you must retrieve it. During your journey you will visit Britain, Italy, Russia, Japan, and finally the States.

Soccer Kid is a platform game with some unique elements.  As the name implies, you have to kill your enemies with your ball. Football-style tricks of keeping the ball in the air and under control are especially useful - headers and overhead kicks can be played with practice. You gain access to the pieces by collecting 11 Player Cards across each world.

There is a saving feature that gives you the ability to save between each country (but not between individual levels).</desc>

You're playing Dexter, a guy fighting the evil madman Borf who has kidnapped your girlfriend Kimberly and is now threatening the world with his dreaded weapon, the "Infanto Ray" which turns adults into small children.

The game plays like a comic strip - visuals are similar to many cartoon movies. In each scene you only have to decide which direction of the keyboard has to be hit in order to avoid one of the countless death screens and to advance to the next screen...</desc>

		<desc>Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels is a mix of a First-Person-Shooter and a tactical fighting game. It is placed in the Warhammer 40k background of the Games Workshop table top games. It is the successor of the PC game Space Hulk from 1993 and it tells of the fight between the imperial Terminator Chapters and the Tyranid Gene Stealers. You control up to ten Terminators. You give them orders in a tactical screen and/or take over one of them and then move in a 3D environment and fight the Gene Stealers just as in a First- Person-Shooter. So the game includes tactical planning and fighting in a good balance.</desc>

		<desc>Following the on-going war of the first Star Control game, the Alliance has lost. The Ur-Quan armada systematically hunts down the alliance races and imprisons them onto their homeworlds, including Earth. However unknown to the Ur-Quan, during the war, a small research vessel had been lost while sent to a distant star system looking for evidence of the ancient Precursor race. The survivors of this research team had come across the controls to a Starship factory and used it to build a Precursor supply vessel: one of the largest vessels in the galaxy. It's time for these Terrans to return to Earth...

Star Control II is a game based on exploration, space combat, diplomacy and resource gathering. Your main starship is the Precursor vessel and it can be used to travel between star systems. This uses fuel which must be processed in exchange for raw materials. In addition to providing fuel, raw materials can also be used to make purchases. You can use them to improve your starship, buy ships for your fleet, and hire crewmembers (who represent your ships' "health"). 

Raw materials are found on surfaces of planets throughout the galaxy; you have to send a landing module to the planet and then guide it around the surface as it picks up the materials you found earlier with your scanner. Each planet is unique in the type of minerals and metals it is formed of. Some planets are plagued by natural dangers such as lightning storms, earthquakes or lava which can damage or destroy your landing modules. Non-sentient lifeforms can also be found and stunned to obtain biological samples. Special installations, objects and ruins can also be found on certain planets. 

While in "deep space", your starship can approach any star you come across, and then you can guide your ship around its system and land on its planets and their moons. Space is treated as two-dimensional and presented in a top-down view. There is also a starmap available which shows the entire galaxy and allows you to set your ship on auto-pilot to any star. 

Throughout space are different alien civilizations. These are represented on the starmap by a sphere of influence. Within the sphere, the aliens have a controlling presence and their ships will venture freely. Outside the sphere, encounters are rarer. Aliens can be dealt with diplomatically, through a series of dialog options, or in combat. 

Combat utilizes the same engine as the first Star Control game, where action is controlled from a top view and influenced by the gravity of nearby planets. Each alien vessel is controlled uniquely and has unique abilities. Combat can also be played as a standalone game ("melee mode"), separate from the main storyline.</desc>

		<desc>3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being "convinced" to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology.

A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, (unless he uses a flight stick with thrust controls such as 3DO's CH Pro stick) and must keep moving at all times.</desc>

Earth faces an alien invasion in the form of the evil Gir Draxon and his forces, and only you and your specially modified tank can stop them. 

The game puts you in the tank's cockpit as you traverse different alien landscapes shooting your weapons against all enemy forces you find in each level. Enemy tanks and turrets have the same firepower as you, so you must make use of the terrain and strafing tactics if you hope to survive.

The game features enhanced, texture-mapped polygonal graphics as well as 2D sprites for specific objects, and also makes use of full CD sound and music, including fully narrated cutscenes.</desc>

The gameplay is the same as Space Ace, Dragon's Lair and Time Gal where the player presses buttons at a certain time to either avoid obstacles or fight enemies in order to advance to the next screen.  As the game progresses, the changes in the world are shown throughout the game depending on the actions of the player.

There are no difficulty settings to choose from. Players can choose from a couple of different scenes to begin at, with other scenes being unlocked as the previous ones are finished.</desc>

		<desc>Supreme Warrior is a full-motion video fighting game.  The game, or interactive movie, is set in China hundreds of years ago.  You are tasked with protecting half of a magical mask.  The wearer of the mask will be granted untold power.  Unfortunately, the villanous Wang Tu has the other half of the mask, and wants your half badly.  So, you must fight off Wang Tu's minions, and eventually Fang Tu himself.

The gameplay in Supreme Warrior consists of digitized video with interactive elements.  At many points during the video, you can unleash a punch, kick, or block.  If your timing is correct, you inflict damage on your opponent.  If you timing is off, your opponent hurts you.</desc>

		<name>Supreme Warrior : Ying Heung</name>
		<desc>Supreme Warrior is a full-motion video fighting game.  The game, or interactive movie, is set in China hundreds of years ago.  You are tasked with protecting half of a magical mask.  The wearer of the mask will be granted untold power.  Unfortunately, the villanous Wang Tu has the other half of the mask, and wants your half badly.  So, you must fight off Wang Tu's minions, and eventually Fang Tu himself.

The gameplay in Supreme Warrior consists of digitized video with interactive elements.  At many points during the video, you can unleash a punch, kick, or block.  If your timing is correct, you inflict damage on your opponent.  If you timing is off, your opponent hurts you.</desc>

		<name>Syndicate</name>
		<desc>In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates).  You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these companies.  It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.

The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.

You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.</desc>

		<desc>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</desc>

Instead of blocks, alien eggs of multiple colors fall down and the player must arrange them in a line of four of the same color in order to dispose of them.  However, if eggs of the same color are arranged into a square, they will hatch and form a giant alien that can instantly end the game for the player.  Players must complete the stage within a certain time limit or prevent the eggs to reach the top of the screen or else their game will end.  They also have the option to either play solo, against the computer or against a friend.</desc>

		<desc>Sometime in the near future, the United States has come under attack by a mysterious threat.  After New York and Los Angeles are destroyed, many Americans have formed an underground resistance to fight off the attackers using a VR Simulator to control their planes to keep their fighters alive.  The player has been recruited and is codenamed "Stalker" to defend the U.S. and bring back peace and order.

There are 15 missions in all, where the player has to complete certain objectives, such as destroy a certain amount of enemies or defend certain targets.  The planes are mostly modern age such as the A-10 Warthog. The player can choose to use either the plane's machine guns or missiles to bring down enemy targets.</desc>

The game offers a practice training mode, a tournament mode and the ability to challenge your friends in a stroke match.

		<name>Wing Commander III : Heart of the Tiger</name>
		<desc>The war against the Kilrathi is going badly for the Confederation. Its flagship, the Concordia, has been destroyed, battles are lost on all fronts. War hero Colonel Christopher Blair is transferred to the old carrier Victory. Take the role of Blair and ensure the success of the Confederation's last-ditch attempt for victory: the destruction of the Kilrathi homeworld.

Wing Commander III has the usual mix of space battles and cinematic storytelling. Changes from the first two games include SVGA graphics, the use of texture-mapped polygons instead of bitmaps for spaceflight sequences and real Hollywood actors appearing in the cinematic scenes.</desc>

		<name>Wolfenstein 3d</name>
		<desc>Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the "Nocturnal Missions" pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed!

In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.

Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate "push walls" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.

Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).

Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).</desc>

		<name>World Cup Golf : Hyatt Dorado Beach</name>
		<desc>World Cup Golf takes the player to Puerto Rico's own Hyatt Dorado Beach Golf Course as they can choose from a bevy of fictional golfers or create their own in 18 rounds of golf. There are 15 types of tournaments to choose from including skins, medal and stableford to name a few. Players can also practice their swing on the driving range.

Players can also customize weather conditions as well as choose from a plethora of camera shots including the "Ball Cam" that follows the ball to its location. Like many golf games, a meter is used to determine the accuracy and the power of the players swing and also features in-game commentary.</desc>
