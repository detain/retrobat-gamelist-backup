		<desc>2 Shot Diary is a collection of twelve short episodes of sexual nature, each told by a different young woman, presented as entries in their diaries. There is no connection between the stories. Each heroine has a different profession and social status (high school student, nurse, model, etc.), where each episode usually centers around a particular sexual theme (voyeurism, lesbian sex, rape, etc.). The game is almost entirely pornographic, with nearly each screen being a depiction of a sexual activity.

The game may be considered a visual novel, because no skill whatsoever is required to play the game and most of it is composed of text accompanied by pictures rather than interaction. Instead of making decisions, characteristically for most visual novels, the player chooses words from a menu to insert into the text. If the choice makes no sense, it simply disappears and the player chooses another one.</desc>

		<name>2 Shot Diary</name>
		<desc>2 Shot Diary is a collection of twelve short episodes of sexual nature, each told by a different young woman, presented as entries in their diaries. There is no connection between the stories. Each heroine has a different profession and social status (high school student, nurse, model, etc.), where each episode usually centers around a particular sexual theme (voyeurism, lesbian sex, rape, etc.). The game is almost entirely pornographic, with nearly each screen being a depiction of a sexual activity.

The game may be considered a visual novel, because no skill whatsoever is required to play the game and most of it is composed of text accompanied by pictures rather than interaction. Instead of making decisions, characteristically for most visual novels, the player chooses words from a menu to insert into the text. If the choice makes no sense, it simply disappears and the player chooses another one.</desc>

		<desc>This is the last of the four episodic games that constitute the sequel to first 2 Shot Diary game. Unlike the first game with its 12 different scenarios, it only contains 2, and both are very short; however (also unlike the first game), most of the scenes here are animated. Both scenarios consist entirely of depictions of explicit sex.

One of the two scenarios depicts a meeting between Kaori, a successful OL ("office lady"), and her boyfriend. The two have sex, liberally utilizing vegetables for their intimate purposes...

The other scenario tells the story of Ayaka, a young girl who goes to a Catholic school. What she experiences there is not what she had expected: she becomes victim of sexual abuse and torture...

The gameplay follows the same template that was utilized in 2 Shot Diary: text and graphical scenes unfold automatically, and the player's input is restricted to choosing words from a list to fill blanks in sentences.</desc>

		<name>Ace Of Spades</name>
		<desc>Ace of Spades is a casino game with a gruesome twist. The player competes against female opponents in poker or blackjack; every victory leads to an explicit scene of sexual torture. The main mode includes a series of matches and subsequent sadistic scenes against various women. It is also possible to play poker or blackjack straight from the main menu, bypassing all these scenes. Both blackjack and poker rules are simplified: there is no betting, and the player with a better hand wins automatically.</desc>

		<name>Ace Of Spades</name>
		<desc>Ace of Spades is a casino game with a gruesome twist. The player competes against female opponents in poker or blackjack; every victory leads to an explicit scene of sexual torture. The main mode includes a series of matches and subsequent sadistic scenes against various women. It is also possible to play poker or blackjack straight from the main menu, bypassing all these scenes. Both blackjack and poker rules are simplified: there is no betting, and the player with a better hand wins automatically.</desc>

		<name>Alaskan Malamute G.c.</name>
		<desc>Alaskan malamute is actually a dog breed (similar to Siberian husky); but this game has nothing to do with dogs and everything to do with golf. The introduction story tells us that in 1912, the famous American businessman J.P.Morgan founded a golf tournament in Alaska. The best golfers from all over the world came to compete, but nobody from Japan... so naturally, the player has to correct that!

Referring to itself as a "3D simulation golf game", Alaskan Malamute G.C. features pseudo-3D terrain with rotatable camera. The player is able to adjust his golfer's position, strength, direction, and style of the shot. It is possible to create own players with different statistics. The game has various play modes, with up to 4 players competing in each; those modes include regular play, tournament, and training.</desc>

		<name>Alone In The Dark</name>
		<desc>Jeremy Hartwood has committed suicide in his Louisiana mansion, Derceto. You take the role of either Edward Carnby, a private investigator, or Emily Hartwood, Jeremy's niece, and investigate the suspicious death. The three-floor mansion is reputed to be haunted by its eccentric past owner. Very quickly, you realise that it is. Warped rats, zombies and giant worms are among the foes who are after you, and you must somehow escape.

Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models.</desc>

		<desc>Jeremy Hartwood has committed suicide in his Louisiana mansion, Derceto. You take the role of either Edward Carnby, a private investigator, or Emily Hartwood, Jeremy's niece, and investigate the suspicious death. The three-floor mansion is reputed to be haunted by its eccentric past owner. Very quickly, you realise that it is. Warped rats, zombies and giant worms are among the foes who are after you, and you must somehow escape.

Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models.</desc>

		<name>Amaranth</name>
		<desc>Trouble is in the kingdom of Stellar. The lovely princess has disappeared, and the king sends his best men to investigate. All they find on the spot where the princess has vanished is a confused young boy who has lost his memory and knows only his name: Liann. Since he still might have some connection to the princess' disappearance, the king sends Liann on a quest to find her. And perhaps along the way, the boy will be able to find the magic flower called Amaranth, that restores people's memories...

Amaranth is a RPG with action-based combat. Enemies appear randomly, and Liann and his party members are taken to a separate battle screen. Attacks are performed by bumping into enemies, like in  Ys series. The other party members are controlled by the AI. Equipment and items can be bought in town shops, and the heroes level up in a standard RPG fashion.</desc>

		<desc>Amaranth III directly continues the story of the  second game. The knight Lyann Fremdes and his lovely companion, the elf Din, the heroes of the game, head to the city of Dematria, where Din is met with joy; there is even an article about her magical healing powers in a local newspaper. All goes well till the heroes decide to visit the city Magnelia. A hostile army invades the train station and massacres people. Looks like Lyann and Din have to hide for the time being, before they can think of a secure way to stop the enemies - which is anything but easy, since the enemy seems to possess advanced technology...

Amaranth III differs from its  predecessors in several ways. It has a more modern setting, with steam-punk elements. The gameplay system has been re-vamped, becoming closer to a strategy RPG than to an action RPG. As before, the battles feature free movement, but it is turn-based now, with action points for each characters; the character can act as long as he/she still have action points left. There is a "Vigour" system that keeps track of characters' stamina; once the vigour is lowered, the character begins to lose hit points. Using special items and resting in inns restores vigour. 

The game also makes a step towards strategy RPGs by focusing less on exploration and more on pre-set, story-dictated battles. However, the small number of controllable characters and the ability to explore prevents it from being a full-fledged strategy RPG.</desc>

		<name>Amaranth 4</name>
		<desc>Amaranth IV continues the over-arching story of the  series. The main heroine in this game is not Liann Fremdes, the usual protagonist of Amaranth games, but his lovely elf companion Din. After visiting the ancient city of Posse and meeting some new friends, Din heads to the capital city of Stellar to meet prince Deinass, whom she helped eight years ago during events described in the  previous game. But shadows from the past keep haunting the young prince. His sister is kidnapped by an old acquaintance. Din, Deinass, and their friends must do everything they can to bring her back and to stop a new threat to the kingdom.

Similarly to the previous game, Amaranth IV contains elements of strategy RPGs: limited exploration, rare and story-dictated battles, and turn-based combat with free movement on the battle field. However, it gets rid of the "vigour" and action points system of the previous game, in favor of simpler gameplay. The player-controlled characters act in turns, and can usually move and execute a physical attack (or cast a spell) one time per turn. Some weapons require specific placement on the field (for example, bows require a character equipped with them to stand diagonally across the enemy in order to be able to attack). Character receive experience points and level up after defeating enemies; fallen character are resurrected to full health after battles. Instead of the usual top-down view, Amaranth IV uses isometric perspective for battles and exploration.</desc>

But shadows from the past keep haunting the young prince. His sister is kidnapped by an old acquaintance. Din, Deinass, and their friends must do everything they can to bring her back and to stop a new threat to the kingdom.

Similarly to the previous game, Amaranth IV contains elements of strategy RPGs: limited exploration, rare and story-dictated battles, and turn-based combat with free movement on the battle field. However, it gets rid of the "vigour" and action points system of the previous game, in favor of simpler gameplay. The player-controlled characters act in turns, and can usually move and execute a physical attack (or cast a spell) one time per turn. Some weapons require specific placement on the field (for example, bows require a character equipped with them to stand diagonally across the enemy in order to be able to attack). Character receive experience points and level up after defeating enemies; fallen character are resurrected to full health after battles. Instead of the usual top-down view, Amaranth IV uses isometric perspective for battles and exploration.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 1999. All over the world, excitement grows as the next millennium approaches. For the ordinary Japanese teenager Masa it doesn't mean that much. But very soon he discovers that he was wrong. At the turn of the millennium, ancient prophecies are being fulfilled.

With the help of the exchange student Sophia, who is in fact an angel in human form, Masa must stop the evil...

Angel Halo is a visual novel: the entire game is composed of text and still graphical images, with an occasional choice to make. The choices lead to various CG pictures, as well as different endings. The game contains explicit nudity and sexual scenes.</desc>

		<desc>Twelve years have passed since the half-elf Pikto and his friends have defeated the evil demon and restored peace in the world of Arcusas. But evil raises its ugly head one more time. The capital city is attacked, the soldiers are massacred... Is the powerful sorcerer Vido to blame? But Pikto knows that in order to preserve peace in the land, different races - elves, dwarves, humans - have to unite. He must find faithful companions, venture to dangerous places. and save the world once again!nnnnArcus III returns to the traditional gameplay concept of the first game: the entire game plays from first-person view; pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons are home to randomly appearing enemies, which must be defeated in turn-based combat. Pikto and his companions can also learn a variety of magic spells.</desc>

		<name>Artemis</name>
		<desc>Two young warriors, Notos and Ing, were traveling in a faraway country, when suddenly a giant woman-snake appeared in front of them. Ing escaped, knowing that Notos was probably killed by the monsters. Tortured by his conscience, Ing is found by a local young girl named Luna. But soon Luna and other young village girls mysteriously disappear, and Ing decides to help them however he can - not forgetting his quest for revenge against the snake...

Despite this RPG-like plot, the game is strictly a Japanese-style adventure. At every given screen, there are the standard Look, Talk, and Think commands. It is typically required to go through all the commands multiple times, obtaining the "Move" command and advancing the story.</desc>

		<name>Balance Of Power</name>
		<desc>The year is 1986. You take on the role of the US President or the Russian General Secretary. You have the full industrial capacity, covert forces, and military might of your country at your command. Your job? To make your country the world's most powerful and prestigious over the course of your eight years in office. Sounds easy, doesn't it? It would be if the other guy didn't have his finger poised over a red button that could wipe out the world!
You must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct military intervention to prop up third world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and his reaction.</desc>

		<name>Birthdays</name>
		<desc>Birthdays is a dating simulation game. The goal of the game is to successfully date a girl of the player's choice. The player first chooses a birthday and a name for his alter ego. Then he is presented with a calendar for the year. Visiting different locations (movies, shopping mall, etc.) leads to meetings with different girls. After learning their phone numbers, it becomes possible to call them and set a date. During dates, the player often has to choose between different dialogue lines to please the girl. It is also possible to buy present for the ladies. It is entirely possible to set dates with multiple girls, but they might meet each other and become jealous. Girls also don't take it lightly if you don't appear on a date. Finally, at the protagonist's next birthday, the most impressed girl will agree to have sex with him. The sex scenes are explicit, but rather few.</desc>

		<name>Blood Seed</name>
		<desc>The spaceship "Triant II", carrying an all-female crew under the command of Rachel Hugett, was attacked by mysterious aliens. The captain ordered to fire the strongest weapons, but nothing could help: the aliens invaded the ship...

...and in a unique twist, the player has to control an alien. No information is given about this playable character, that looks like a red crab. It starts at level 1, at the point where it invaded the ship. The game plays like a first-person dungeon crawler (this time the word "crawler" taken quite literally!). The alien moves through the pseudo-3D corridors of the ship. Crew members, robots and machines appear randomly and try to stop it. The battles are turn-based. The alien has two primary kinds of attacks at its disposal: physical attack (with its claw), and electricity attack. Defeating enemies brings experience points, leveling up the creature.</desc>

		<name>Bomber Quest</name>
		<desc>A young man named Shounosuke sees a strange dream: a voice talks about mankind and its sins, and a beautiful girl begs him to save her... The next day, when he goes to school, an earthquake occurs, and he is miraculously taken into another world, where he meets the girl from his dreams. She says that girls in different dimensions are in grave danger, and Shounosuke has to save them...

Bomber Quest has elements of both strategy/puzzle game and RPG. Each of the six girls has a different scenario, accessible from the beginning. Each scenario puts the player character into a top-down environment. Shounosuke has to build a maze to access its locations. The maze is built from small pieces taken from  Tetris. The player can rotate the pieces and then place them onto the ground. The goal is to build a maze that would cover possibly large ground, gaining access to important locations and items. Visiting uncovered locations in the right order leads to cut scenes, which advance the plot. 

Shounosuke will be randomly attacked by enemies during his wanderings through the mazes. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective and are turn-based. Shounosuke can only use physical attacks and items. Defeating enemies brings experience points, leveling Shounosuke up in a standard RPG fashion.

The game features scenes with nudity and sexual content.</desc>

Shounosuke can only use physical attacks and items. Defeating enemies brings experience points, leveling Shounosuke up in a standard RPG fashion.

		<desc>A young man named Shounosuke sees a strange dream: a voice talks about mankind and its sins, and a beautiful girl begs him to save her... The next day, when he goes to school, an earthquake occurs, and he is miraculously taken into another world, where he meets the girl from his dreams. She says that girls in different dimensions are in grave danger, and Shounosuke has to save them...

Bomber Quest has elements of both strategy/puzzle game and RPG. Each of the six girls has a different scenario, accessible from the beginning. Each scenario puts the player character into a top-down environment. Shounosuke has to build a maze to access its locations. The maze is built from small pieces taken from  Tetris. The player can rotate the pieces and then place them onto the ground. The goal is to build a maze that would cover possibly large ground, gaining access to important locations and items. Visiting uncovered locations in the right order leads to cut scenes, which advance the plot.

		<desc>Somewhere in the desert of Kalua, in the country of Suelang, stands a huge tower. This is the Tower of Fata Morgana. Legends say that powerful ancient wisdom is hidden in this tower. But no one dares to venture in, fearing ferocious monsters and deadly traps. Three people, however, are exception to this rule: the young thief Dee, who hopes to steal treasure from the tower; the lovely elf witch Clare, who needs to discover ancient magic; and finally, a mysterious man named Quien, who doesn't remember his past and works as a mercenary...

Brandish VT is the fourth installment of the  Brandish series. It abandons the over-arching story of the previous titles and tells a completely unrelated tale. The player is able to choose Dee, Clare, or Quien as the playable character right from the beginning. Each one of them starts in a different location, but eventually will have to face the riddles of the Tower. The gameplay is similar to the previous Brandish games, with point-and-click interface (or keyboard short-cuts), real-time combat, and the ability to jump. As before, there is a RPG system with experience points and levels. The game abandons the top-down view of the previous games, using isometric perspective.</desc>

As before, there is a RPG system with experience points and levels. The game abandons the top-down view of the previous games, using isometric perspective.</desc>

		<desc>The island of Radja was a peaceful place, ruled by a benevolent king. But one day, monsters have invaded the island. Both the prince and the princess of the kingdom were abducted. The king summons Shami, who, despite being a cute young girl, is the most powerful warrior of the kingdom. Shami has first to rescue the king's children, and eventually to find out the source of the demonic invasion.

Gameplay-wise, Branmarker mainly follows early  Dragon Quest template: it is a top-down RPG with random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective. The player controls Shami and another character who joins the party. Shami can cast a variety of offensive and healing spells, the majority of which must be found in treasure chests located in the dungeons rather than bought or learned. The main gameplay takes part in hostile areas, which are reasonably complex and maze-like, taking a while to explore. Leveling up is automatic, and combat mechanics are basic Japanese RPG fare. What makes it different are the various anime-style cutscenes scattered through the game, most of which feature nudity and erotic content.</desc>

		<desc>Bunkasai puts the player in the role of a male Japanese high-school student. One day his teacher tells him about the upcoming culture festival, giving him the assignment to help his lovely classmate Mia in the preparations. Naturally, the young man's mind is more directed towards... err... other aspects of Mia's personality. But what starts as a simple collaboration between high-school students soon turns into a drama full of violence and difficult decisions to make...

The game is a Japanese-style adventure with reduced command menu and interaction. At every given screen, there are a few commands (mostly just two), sometimes the standard Look and Talk, sometimes context-based actions. Usually the story advances automatically when the player has gone through all the commands several times.

The game has nudity and explicit sex scenes.</desc>

He intends to resurrect Daar and attack the king of Kypros. His minions attack three strongest knights who serve the king. But before he died, one of the knights released eight magical pearls. Each pearl can choose a hero, and eight heroes together would be able to stop Bido. Those heroes live in different places and belong to different races - humans, dragons, lizard-men, dog-like wosshus. Among them there are simple fighters, a thief, a powerful sorcerer. But they all know - the future of Kypros lies in their hands...</desc>

		<desc>The evil god Daar was defeated long time ago. The difference races of Kypros could co-exist in peace. But Daar had followers, among them a powerful warrior named Bido. He intends to resurrect Daar and attack the king of Kypros. His minions attack three strongest knights who serve the king. But before he died, one of the knights released eight magical pearls. Each pearl can choose a hero, and eight heroes together would be able to stop Bido. Those heroes live in different places and belong to different races - humans, dragons, lizard-men, dog-like wosshus. Among them there are simple fighters, a thief, a powerful sorcerer. But they all know - the future of Kypros lies in their hands...</desc>

		<name>Cal</name>
		<desc>The hero of this game is an ordinary high school student (the player has to name him by himself). He is mostly interested in pretty girls, in particular the lovely Mika, with whom he is even ready to discuss books just to get her attention. One day, a beautiful woman appears in front of him out of nowhere. She says that she is Venus, the goddess of love. She comes from a world called Cal, the eternal world populated by lovely girls. She tells the hero that soon he will be needed in that world... and disappears. Was that a dream? Or will our hero really travel to the magical world of Cal and encounter dangers he hasn't even imagined before?

Cal is a visual novel, with the sole interaction consisting of choosing sentences to say and sometimes actions to do from a context-specific menu at the bottom of the screen. Usually only one such selection triggers the next event; some choices lead to Game Over. The game contains erotic pictures with nudity and sexual situations.</desc>

		<desc>The story of this game is simple. The protagonist is a lonely guy who constantly dreams about having a girlfriend but doesn't do anything to actually get one. One night, a fairy with bunny ears named Ariko appears in front of him and says she will fulfill one wish for him. Afterwards she simply guesses what the guy needs most badly: a girlfriend. So she gives him a magic book, which will give him information about five beautiful girls living somewhere in the city. With this book the hero's chances are increased. The quest for love begins!

The game plays like a standard Japanese adventure (still shots of locations, menu-based interface), with some additions. The hero can buy items and give them to girls as presents to impress them. The conversations with the girls involve going through several topics to find out what the girl likes. Once a girl seems to be "ready", it's possible to directly use commands such as "kiss the girl", "touch the girl" (with body parts specified), and even "***** the girl", which speaks for itself.</desc>

		<name>Can Can Bunny 5 12 Limited</name>
		<desc>The sixth (or fifth and a half, as the title suggests) installment of the long-running  Can Can Bunny series belongs to the same story arc that started in the  fourth game and was continued in the  fifth. The player character is the same nameless hero that starred in the two predecessors. But in this game, the lovely goddess Swatty is not here to help the hero to find girls. Instead, all the hero gets is an apprentice goddess named Sawady, who is just a brat and who bothers the hero all the time. Looks like this is going to be the toughest quest yet, with Sawady around and with pretty, but tough-to-seduce girls!

Gameplay-wise, Can Can Bunny 5 1/2 Limited is more simplified than the previous game. The standard menu commands ("Look", "Talk", etc.) are gone. The only possible interaction consists of moving to various locations (menu choice), and selecting a dialogue choice during conversations. There are also less girls than in the previous game, and no extras (such as the album with the pictures of the girls, etc.).</desc>

		<name>Cats Part 1</name>
		<desc>Cat's Part 1 casts the player in the role of an unnamed protagonist, presumably young, male, and very interested in the members of the opposite sex. One fine day he meets Stella, the queen of magic world. She tells him that her duty is to sustain the balance between worlds, but now her power is fading, which means a new queen has to arrive and take her place. To find this queen, Stella tells her companion Pixie to open the gates to seven different worlds: three modern-day ones, three futuristic ones, and one "past", and sends the hero on the quest for balance in the world... and numerous sexually fulfilling encounters with pretty girls from different dimensions.

The game plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, with still pictures, plenty of text, and the necessity to go through all the commands several times to trigger new ones and eventually advance the story. However, unlike most games of this kind, Cat's Part 1 features a point-and-click interface along with the usual menu-based choices. Thus, the player can interact with various body parts of the girls, as well as some objects, by simply clicking on them.

The player must complete Modern World 1 first, but after that is free to travel to the six remaining worlds in any order. It is also possible to teleport out of the world at any time using a magic stone.</desc>

		<desc>One day, a lone traveler came from the desert to a small camp. There, he sat down, weary from his long travel, enjoying a short rest. "Have you heard of the Tower of Ouroboros"? - asked him a bearded old man who was sitting nearby. - "A legend says that if fulfills all your wishes. Many heroes tried their luck there. None has returned. Dangers lure at every corner in the tower, deadly enchantresses who will bring demise on anyone daring to set his foot there". Without answering, the young traveler left the camp, and soon he was standing at the tower gate...nnChaos Angels is a semi-erotic RPG similar to the first two Dragon Knight games. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. You gradually explore the huge 3D dungeon, the Tower of Ouroboros, fighting enemies and gaining experience points.</desc>

		<desc>Charade describes the daily high-school routine of a girl named Kazumi. The game proceeds from one school day to another, putting Kazumi in the same situations, facing the same choices. Those choices, as well as random events and meetings with other characters, schoolmates and teachers (only female), change Kazumi's viewpoints as well as relationships with the other girls.

The game is basically a visual novel, though choices pop out more than usually in games of this genre. Basically, each situation leads to two or more choices, such as choosing a location to go to, waiting for a character or leaving the room, dialogue choices, joining high school clubs, etc.</desc>

		<name>Chick's Tale</name>
		<desc>Chicks' Tale is a card game with  hentai scenes. Player-controlled character competes against four young girls. The rules of the game are rather simple: each player is dealt ten cards. Following clockwise turns, each player has either to play a card that has a higher value than the previous one, or pass. Winning a hand allows the player to begin the next turn with the card of his/her choice. It is also possible to play several cards of the same value at once. Whoever has played all the ten cards first wins the round.

After three rounds, a cut-scene follows, during which the defeated character shares sexual experiences from her life, presented as sexually explicit images with text. Afterwards, the card game is resumed.</desc>

		<name>Coin</name>
		<desc>The hero of this game (default name Ryouta) is a typical  hentai protagonist: a  male teenager who is interested only in sex. One day, Ryouta finds a cute black bunny and brings it home; the next morning, the bunny turns into a sexy black-haired girl! Needless to say the activities the two perform during the course of the game do not include playing chess or discussing philosophy. But Ryouta is not satisfied with the "bunny girl" alone, what with all those cute female schoolmates around him...

Coin is a visual novel with an emphasis on decision-making. Choices that the player has to make periodically lead to different scenes. Many of the choices (for example, raping a girl) are considered "wrong" and lead to a premature ending of the game.</desc>

		<desc>The hero of this game (default name Ryouta) is a typical  hentai protagonist: a  male teenager who is interested only in sex. One day, Ryouta finds a cute black bunny and brings it home; the next morning, the bunny turns into a sexy black-haired girl! Needless to say the activities the two perform during the course of the game do not include playing chess or discussing philosophy. But Ryouta is not satisfied with the "bunny girl" alone, what with all those cute female schoolmates around him...

Coin is a visual novel with an emphasis on decision-making. Choices that the player has to make periodically lead to different scenes. Many of the choices (for example, raping a girl) are considered "wrong" and lead to a premature ending of the game.</desc>

		<name>Columns</name>
		<desc>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</desc>

		<desc>The hero of this game is a teenage boy who failed his high-school examination; as a result, his parents decided to transfer him to a special school in another city. The young hero is at first sad and depressed, but soon discovers that the situation might not be so bad after all: the mansion in which he is going to leave is not empty, and his neighbors are all young pretty girls...

Coming Heart is a standard low-interaction Japanese adventure, with the omni-present "Look-Talk-Think" commands, occasionally accompanied by "Move". On a few occasions there are some dialogue choices, which might lock/unlock certain scenes. The sex scenes are non-interactive.</desc>

		<desc>Youhei is a Japanese teenager who is bored with his life, unable to find excitement anywhere. Even sexual escapades with various women don't satisfy him: he craves for real adventures. But on that particular day, his wishes were fulfilled in a very unexpected way. He was talking to a schoolmate named Mahiro, a girl he didn't even like particularly, when something like an earthquake shattered the school. Youhei and Mahiro hurried to the nearby classroom, only to find a strange mirror-like object - which in fact was a portal to a dungeon in another world. Now the two teenagers have to find a way to escape from the dungeon - and eventually to return home.

Crystal Rinal is an adult dungeon crawler along the lines of  Words Worth or  Raidy games; but instead of a lonely hero/heroine, the player controls a party of two, Youhei and Mahiro, who fight randomly appearing monsters in turn-based combat. There is also a "talk" command that lets the two heroes chat with each other and comment on the situation. Some gameplay segments follow the template of a Japanese adventure, with menu-based commands and multiple choices during dialogues.</desc>

		<name>Crystal Rinal Ouma no Meikyuu</name>
		<desc>Youhei is a Japanese teenager who is bored with his life, unable to find excitement anywhere. Even sexual escapades with various women don't satisfy him: he craves for real adventures. But on that particular day, his wishes were fulfilled in a very unexpected way. He was talking to a schoolmate named Mahiro, a girl he didn't even like particularly, when something like an earthquake shattered the school. Youhei and Mahiro hurried to the nearby classroom, only to find a strange mirror-like object - which in fact was a portal to a dungeon in another world. Now the two teenagers have to find a way to escape from the dungeon - and eventually to return home.

Crystal Rinal is an adult dungeon crawler along the lines of  Words Worth or  Raidy games; but instead of a lonely hero/heroine, the player controls a party of two, Youhei and Mahiro, who fight randomly appearing monsters in turn-based combat. There is also a "talk" command that lets the two heroes chat with each other and comment on the situation. Some gameplay segments follow the template of a Japanese adventure, with menu-based commands and multiple choices during dialogues.</desc>

		<name>Custom Mate</name>
		<desc>A young man finds a mysterious box. Making sure no one is at home, he opens the box and finds a scroll with a magic incantation inside. He chants the magic spell - and immediately a cute female elf appears. She says she can create any girl the hero wants. But once the girl is created, he has to figure out how to win her good graces...

Custom Mate can be called a "seduction simulator". Lacking the adventure elements of  Cocktail's most famous series,  Can Can Bunny, Custom Mate offers much deeper simulation gameplay instead. In the beginning of the game, the player effectively "creates" the girl he will need to seduce; it is possible to choose age, height, breast size, hair style, and personality. Mixing all these parameters results in different girls who require different approach. For example, an older, experienced and direct woman might appreciate physical stimulation (kissing etc.), while a young shy girl needs to talk more before the hero can afford any straight-forward actions. 

The gameplay is menu-driven - the player can choose to talk, to ask, to look, to touch, to kiss, and to take off the girl's clothes. Choosing one of these actions usually leads to a sub-menu, which varies depending on the girl and the current situation. For example, the "talk" menu usually brings a large sub-menu of more precise actions ("praise", "order", "beg", etc.), each of which opens new sub-menus. Similarly, physical interaction can also become quite detailed: the "kiss" command opens a sub-menu ("lick", "bite", etc.). Physical interaction is made more precise by implementing a point-and-click interface; in many cases, choosing the exact body part to interact with can be a matter of "life and death", since it is possible to make a girl very angry, which might lead to a Game Over.</desc>

		<desc>The second game in the  Custom Mate series once again allows the hero to create the girl of his dreams; this time not magically, but by engaging the services of Custom Corporation, whose operator is nevertheless still the same cute elf who created the girls in the previous game.

The "girl creation" part offers more possibilities than before, such as exact bra size or the clothes the girl will wear (school girl, nurse, etc.). This allows more combinations and therefore more different girls. The "seduction simulator" part is simplified compared to the first game. Instead of menu-based interface, initiating conversations, and physical interaction, the entire seduction part is composed of a conversation between the protagonist and the girl. The dialogue/action choices, however, are numerous and varied. The difficulty level varies greatly depending on the girl's personality, age, profession, etc.</desc>

		<desc>The second game in the  Custom Mate series once again allows the hero to create the girl of his dreams; this time not magically, but by engaging the services of Custom Corporation, whose operator is nevertheless still the same cute elf who created the girls in the previous game.

The "girl creation" part offers more possibilities than before, such as exact bra size or the clothes the girl will wear (school girl, nurse, etc.). This allows more combinations and therefore more different girls. The "seduction simulator" part is simplified compared to the first game.

		<name>Custom Mate 3</name>
		<desc>It's Christmas. Hayashi Ryuusuke is walking through the crowded city, feeling sad that he is alone on such a day. Suddenly, he spots a neon sign: Custom Mate. He enters and sees a strange receptionist with elf-like ears and a magic symbol on the forehead. She creates the girl of his dreams and they get married! But this is just the beginning, and Ryuusuke realizes that marriage is not all about the honeymoon...

The third  Custom Mate game differs from its predecessors by offering much deeper simulation gameplay, which includes different aspects of the life of a married couple beside just sex. In the beginning, the player creates the protagonist, choosing his age, blood type, and personality. The future wife is created the same way. Unlike the previous games, it is impossible to change appearance and physical aspects of the girl; however, there are many more personality traits.

After the honeymoon, the couple returns to daily routine. The player can make daily or monthly schedule. The wife's behavior is determined by character creation, but also by the choices the player makes. The wife would often ask questions, make suggestions, etc.; the player's reaction determines future interactions and the overall development of the relationship. The couple has various parameters, from love level to monetary wealth. Sex interaction plays an important role; the player should choose the right actions, depending on the wife's personality, otherwise the relationship will deteriorate. Menu-based interface is utilized for most of the game, but the actual sex interaction is done in point-and-click fashion, with action icons.</desc>

In the beginning, the player creates the protagonist, choosing his age, blood type, and personality. The future wife is created the same way. Unlike the previous games, it is impossible to change appearance and physical aspects of the girl; however, there are many more personality traits.

After the honeymoon, the couple returns to daily routine. The player can make daily or monthly schedule. The wife's behavior is determined by character creation, but also by the choices the player makes. The wife would often ask questions, make suggestions, etc.; the player's reaction determines future interactions and the overall development of the relationship. The couple has various parameters, from love level to monetary wealth. Sex interaction plays an important role; the player should choose the right actions, depending on the wife's personality, otherwise the relationship will deteriorate. Menu-based interface is utilized for most of the game, but the actual sex interaction is done in point-and-click fashion, with action icons.</desc>

		<desc>It's Christmas. Hayashi Ryuusuke is walking through the crowded city, feeling sad that he is alone on such a day. Suddenly, he spots a neon sign: Custom Mate. He enters and sees a strange receptionist with elf-like ears and a magic symbol on the forehead. She creates the girl of his dreams and they get married!

		<name>Cyber Illusion</name>
		<desc>Around the turn of the millennium, global warming has become a reality. Abusing energy and the Earth's resources, humanity has driven itself to a point where normal life on Earth could no longer exist. Drastic rise of temperatures caused planet-wide dehydration. The only way to keep existing was through the Cyber Net, a virtual reality system. But soon the Cyber Net began to suffer from continuous assaults by hackers, who programmed lethal viruses into it. Thus, the Cyber Police was born. The protagonist of the game is a high-ranked officer of Cyber Police. With the help of his team, he has to solve the hacker problem once and for all.

Cyber Illusion is a Japanese-style adventure. The interaction with the game world is performed by choosing the menu commands Look, Talk, Move, as well as context-specific ones that appear during some scenes. It is also possible to influence the course of the story by making choices at certain points. 

The game has explicit sex scenes, which are interactive and feature a point-and-click interface.</desc>

		<name>Dalk</name>
		<desc>A young man gets involved in a struggle between the gods Martis and Mira. Serving Martis, he believes that in order to restore the balance he has to unseal this deity, the protector of all women. Fourteen chosen girls must fight alongside the hero, venturing into the depth of a sacred mountain and helping him to defeat countless monsters who live there.

Made by the creators of Rance series, Dalk is an erotic RPG. However, it is more heavy on strategy element than Rance games. Town navigation is done from first-person view. You choose your party members among the 14 available girls, and take them to fight in the mountain. Once you enter the dungeon, the game switches to top-down view, and you advance in turn-based mode, assigning commands to your party and waiting for the enemy party to move. You can attack when an enemy is in range, or cast spells with your magic users.</desc>

		<name>Dalk</name>
		<desc>A young man gets involved in a struggle between the gods Martis and Mira. Serving Martis, he believes that in order to restore the balance he has to unseal this deity, the protector of all women. Fourteen chosen girls must fight alongside the hero, venturing into the depth of a sacred mountain and helping him to defeat countless monsters who live there.

Made by the creators of Rance series, Dalk is an erotic RPG. However, it is more heavy on strategy element than Rance games. Town navigation is done from first-person view. You choose your party members among the 14 available girls, and take them to fight in the mountain. Once you enter the dungeon, the game switches to top-down view, and you advance in turn-based mode, assigning commands to your party and waiting for the enemy party to move. You can attack when an enemy is in range, or cast spells with your magic users.</desc>

		<name>Dark Gaiden</name>
		<desc>Although it is branded a gaiden ("side story"), this game is actually a direct sequel to the  first D'ark. The anti-hero of the previous game, the mysterious Dulldeek, has released the four Dragon Knights in order to help the Darkness to defeat the Light in the upcoming battle. After the light warrior Felnous was defeated by Dulldeek, it looked like the Light has lost...

D'ark Gaiden allows the player to play through two scenarios, one continuing the adventures of Dulldeek and the Dragon Knights (starting as the Black Dragon Knight Zarsch, one of Dulldeek's companions), the other casting Felnous as a protagonist, recovering after the battle with Dulldeek and swearing to exact revenge.

The gameplay is essentially the same as in the previous game: basic solo dungeon crawl through pseudo-3D mazes, turn-based combat against random enemies. It is now possible to cast defensive support magic. The animations in combat are improved, and there are more different textures in the dungeons. As in the first game, there is the possibility to turn random encounters off; in this game, there is an additional "MAX" option, which cranks the encounter rate up.</desc>

		<name>Deep</name>
		<desc>In 1999, the Third World War has devastated most of the countries on the Earth. The one that emerged stronger than before was Japan. It became the world's undisputed leader in technology. In the beginning of the 21st century, a company named Nexus began developing a new technology that would eventually lead to production of cyborgs. Nexus soon became the world's most powerful corporation. By then, cyborgs broke loose and caused violent incidents everywhere. A special unit called "Hunter" was deployed to combat them. But Nexus wouldn't stop with their experiments. In 2014, their newest project began, called "Halleluja"...

In Deep, the player can choose between four main characters, which include the result of the Halleluja project, an artificial young girl who is called "Jesus" and proclaimed to be the savior of the world, as well as three other, less important characters, all having their own agenda. The story is, however, the same for all characters.

The gameplay consists of moving on a map with grids and accessing different locations. Sometimes there would be branching paths, but the progression is mostly linear and the same for all characters. Most of the locations contain one screen with a character picture. It is possible to interact with characters in point-and-click fashion, with the cursor turning to "Look", "Talk", and other commands. 

Sometimes, enemies would pop out and attack the player character. Some battles are pre-set and story-related. Even though the player characters have statistics and carry weapons, there are no real RPG elements in the game. The turn-based battles have a timer; if the player failed to choose an action within the time limit, the enemy will have a free turn. To make combat more challenging, the command menu is very large and has useful as well as useless commands, which are mixed up at the beginning of each turn.

The game contains graphics with explicit sexual content.</desc>

		<name>Demon City</name>
		<desc>On the continent of Barnhedge, there lies a kingdom named Vagrand. The inhabitants of the country are followers of what they call the "True Religion", which teaches them, quite simply, to enjoy life in all possible ways, without controlling their desires and lust. As a result, the capital of Vagrand became the center of corporeal pleasures, and its neighbors started calling it the "Demon City". The player controls a Vagrand knight who is sent by the princess Leticia on a confident mission. But intrigues and uncontrolled lust surround the hero everywhere: opposition in the palace, a young girl named Milk who wants him all for herself, and the mysterious cult of the Moon are all there to make the hero's life hard...

Demon City is a Japanese-style adventure. The interface consists of icons, selectable at any time, which correspond to actions such as Examine, Talk, Move, etc. The player can visit various locations in the city and its surrounding (done by choosing the Move command and a location name from the menu). During sex scenes, the interface changes somewhat, with additional icons for more specific sexual actions.</desc>

		<name>Dengeki Division</name>
		<desc>The powerful god known as Black B was securely sealed, preventing his powers from corrupting humans. The people of the Kingdom enjoyed a prosperous, peaceful life. But that ended when the nearby country, ruled by a ruthless Empress, heard of the sealed god. The Empire attacked the Kingdom, which had no other choice but release Black B and use his powers to defend themselves. Black B readily agreed to help, on one condition: all the generals in his army must be female...

Dengeki Division is a turn-based strategy/RPG hybrid. The player's first input is to throw dice to determine the amount of points that can be used to raised the parameters (strength, intelligence, agility, etc.) of the female generals. The player also assigns character classes (warrior, monk, magician, etc.) to them. Afterwards, the story unrolls; battles are dictated by the story, and there is no movement in the game outside of the battle field. Combat takes place on isometric locations, where only the immediate surroundings of the player-controlled characters are shown. The player then navigates the characters over the field, attacking enemies when they are in range of physical attacks or magic spells. Hurting a female enemy character (or sustaining damage) triggers a small nude picture of said character.</desc>

		<desc>The main hero of the game is a young doctor named Tanchi. One day, his boss, the old professor Akihabara, invites him to his office and reveals some secrets concerning the young man's parents and an international crime syndicate known as Black Cross, which Akihabara was trying to bring down. Meanwhile, Black Cross sends a female agent under codename 0074 to assassinate a certain powerful man who happens to stay in the same hospital where Tanchi works...

Dengeki Nurse consists of two main gameplay modes: Japanese-style adventure and turn-based one-on-one battles. The adventure gameplay stars Tanchi as protagonist, and requires the player to click on verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, Action, and Move) to advance the story. The turn-based battles have agent 0074 (Kirara) as the playable character, and occur as events dictated by the story; there is also a "Free Battle" mode (accessible from the main menu), which allows the player to fight against an opponent of his/her choice. Kirara can perform regular attacks (punches and kicks) for low damage, spend turns to charge power and unleash a devastating attack afterwards, or use various drugs for healing and supporting purposes.</desc>

One day, his boss, the old professor Akihabara, invites him to his office and reveals some secrets concerning the young man's parents and an international crime syndicate known as Black Cross, which Akihabara was trying to bring down. Meanwhile, Black Cross sends a female agent under codename 0074 to assassinate a certain powerful man who happens to stay in the same hospital where Tanchi works...

Dengeki Nurse consists of two main gameplay modes: Japanese-style adventure and turn-based one-on-one battles. The adventure gameplay stars Tanchi as protagonist, and requires the player to click on verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, Action, and Move) to advance the story. The turn-based battles have agent 0074 (Kirara) as the playable character, and occur as events dictated by the story; there is also a "Free Battle" mode (accessible from the main menu), which allows the player to fight against an opponent of his/her choice. Kirara can perform regular attacks (punches and kicks) for low damage, spend turns to charge power and unleash a devastating attack afterwards, or use various drugs for healing and supporting purposes.</desc>

		<desc>One day an unusual request arrives at the detective office where the main character works. The client's fiancée refuses to gain intimacy to him and he seeks for ways to change that. Compared to the previous "Pure" game of QueenSoft, the systems got more forgiving resulting in less stress. The story is same as absent here too though. Character designs are uneven. The feature of this work is that all the girls are in their twenties and possibly even in the thirties.</desc>

		<desc>One day an unusual request arrives at the detective office where the main character works. The client's fiancée refuses to gain intimacy to him and he seeks for ways to change that. Compared to the previous "Pure" game of QueenSoft, the systems got more forgiving resulting in less stress. The story is same as absent here too though. Character designs are uneven. The feature of this work is that all the girls are in their twenties and possibly even in the thirties.</desc>

		<desc>DOR features three independent scenarios, which are not connected to each other story-wise and can be accessed directly from the main menu.
The first scenario depicts a meeting between the male protagonist and a mysterious young woman near a giant observatory telescope. The hero finds out about the woman's tragic past and proceeds to "console" her.
The second scenario describes a telephone date a boy named Takeshi arranges with two "OLs" ("office ladies"). The hero must manipulate the conversation in such a way that he will win the graces of both.
The third scenario involves a cute female vampire named Kanako visiting the (again, male) hero in his apartment. Kanako is hungry and needs blood, so the protagonist has to come up with the right idea of what to demand in exchange for it.
All the three scenarios share the same gameplay: at every screen, the player is presented with a short list of possible answers/actions.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to  DOR is structured exactly the same way as the first game: play any of the three unrelated scenarios, accessible directly from the main menu.

The first scenario takes the player into France of 16th century, during a witch hunt. The playable character is a young girl who is falsely accused of being a witch and is taken into a dungeon, interrogated, and tortured. 

The second scenario follows the adventures of a young boy who has lost his way in a forest. Suddenly he meets a cute little female elf, who is willing to help him find the right way, in exchange for some other favors...

The third scenario is named "Armored Fighter Gyleban" and is in a way a parody on sci-fi anime movies. The player controls a commander of a unit of female fighters with enhanced abilities, that must stop an evil organization from conquering our world.

Like in the first  DOR, the gameplay is limited to selecting actions/answers from a menu at each screen. Correctly chosen actions will advance the story, while wrong ones will lead to a premature ending.</desc>

		<desc>DOR Special Edition '93 consists of three independent scenarios. 
The first scenario tells the story of Hiroshi, who has organised an expedition into the South American jungle to find the source of youth. The group has to face monsters and other dangerous jungle specimens...
The second scenario focuses on Farouk, who has been cursed by an evil magician. In order to lift the curse, Farouk travels across a vast desert to a nearby town, hoping to find people to help him in his predicament.
In the third scenario, the protagonist is the leader of a squad of female fighters, who are fighting an organisation led by Grauber. Meiya leaves this organisation and decides to help the heroines in their fight.
The gameplay is largely similar to the other DOR games: it is about making choices in a menu until the next scene is triggered.</desc>

		<desc>DOR Special Edition '93 consists of three independent scenarios. 
The first scenario tells the story of Hiroshi, who has organised an expedition into the South American jungle to find the source of youth. The group has to face monsters and other dangerous jungle specimens...
The second scenario focuses on Farouk, who has been cursed by an evil magician. In order to lift the curse, Farouk travels across a vast desert to a nearby town, hoping to find people to help him in his predicament.
In the third scenario, the protagonist is the leader of a squad of female fighters, who are fighting an organisation led by Grauber. Meiya leaves this organisation and decides to help the heroines in their fight.
The gameplay is largely similar to the other DOR games: it is about making choices in a menu until the next scene is triggered.</desc>

		<name>Dor Special Edition Sakigake</name>
		<desc>DOR Special Edition: Sakigake is the fourth entry in the  DOR series. Unlike all the previous games, it contains only one scenario instead of the usual three.

The scenario follows the story of Kensuke Funaki, a young boy who attends a prestigious private high school, where the students specialize in sports as well as various theatrical activities. The biggest event of the school is an all-female wrestling competition. Kensuke finds himself in a promising situation: in order to secure his support, the young and pretty competitors are willing to go far - very, very far...

The gameplay in DOR Special Edition: Sakigake is  the same as in the previous entries. At every screen, the player reads a bulk of text (descriptions and dialogue), after which a menu with a few (usually three) selectable actions/responses pops out. It is often needed to go through the choices several times before the next event is triggered, and the player is taken to another screen.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Half</name>
		<desc>One of the games based on Ryuusuke Mita's eponymous manga. The story focuses on the manga's protagonist, a cute half-human, half-dragon girl named Mink. She is in love with a pop singer and dragon-slayer Dick Saucer; however, to win his love, Mink has to find a magical potion to turn her into a human. In the game, Mink and her friend Lufa and Pia are having a vacation on the beach, listening to Dick Saucer's concert on the radio. When Dick mentions Mink in his "special thanks" speech, she decides to find him no matter what, even if it means changing her own nature.

This version of Dragon Half is an RPG with card-based system. The player navigates Mink, Lufa, and Pia through the top-down environments, encountering random enemies. During battles, the player selects cards for attack, healing, and other actions; there is no individual control of party members, and they also share an HP pool. The player can select several cards of the same type to increase the corresponding effect, or choose to save some of the cards for later to perform even more powerful combos.</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Knight 4 is a sequel to Knights of Xentar. Years have passed after Takeru defeated the ultimate evil. He married his sweetheart Luna, and they had a son named Kakeru. This fifteen-year-old boy has one weakness: he likes naked female elves. But soon he learns that the evil wizard Lushifon wants to turn all people into stones and control the whole world while nobody is able to stop him.

		<desc>Dragon Knight 4 is a sequel to Knights of Xentar. Years have passed after Takeru defeated the ultimate evil. He married his sweetheart Luna, and they had a son named Kakeru. This fifteen-year-old boy has one weakness: he likes naked female elves. But soon he learns that the evil wizard Lushifon wants to turn all people into stones and control the whole world while nobody is able to stop him. Together with the mysterious swordsman Eto and many other heroes, Kakeru must perform his ultimate quest and defeat Lushifon and his minions.
In this tactical role-playing game the player controls nine units in battles, assigned according to the class of the character who leads the unit. The opponents also form similar groups, and are also divided into classes. Each class has its own range, strengths, and weaknesses. There are many characters the players can recruit to the party, and they belong to different classes (barbarians, archers, magicians, etc.).</desc>

		<name>E.s.p.</name>
		<desc>E.S.P. is a side-scrolling shooter. There is no plot in the game - the player controls a robot-like flying device, shooting his way through hordes of organic and mechanical enemies. The player-controlled device can be moved in four directions, and also adjust the angle of fire. There is only one kind of power-up in the game (a floating letter P); eating it will expand the range of the device's fire and also grant it an additional weapon (shooting blue spheres); the player can then adjust the fire angle in such a way that the device can shoot in different directions with different weapons.

Each stage features two or three mini-bosses and a final boss. Fighting the bosses usually requires memorizing their fire patterns, avoiding their attacks and firing when there is an opening. There is no health bar in the game; the player is sent back to the beginning of the stage whenever his device touches an enemy or is hit by enemy fire. There are unlimited continues.

Instead of cut-scenes, usually advancing the plot in this type of games, the player is shown a completely unrelated erotic picture of a young girl after the end of each level.</desc>

		<desc>Edge is a side-scrolling beat 'em up and the gameplay involves a lot of enemies blasting, and then generally a battle against a boss to complete the level. The playing field is displayed without depth, as in a platformer. Some items can be collected, allowing you to expand your life-bar length.</desc>

		<name>Elm Knight</name>
		<desc>Elm Knight is set in a futuristic world, dominated by the totalitarian regime of the Empire, which hunts down the so-called "Irregulars" - people who have supernatural abilities. The young Rick Chandler is attending the Pilot Academy, where he learns to control giant robots known as "MPS". He discovers that he might be in possession of magical abilities (which would make him an Irregular), and escapes to the desert, where he meets a girl named Selena, who directs him to the base of a rebel organization. Joining the rebels, Rick must face his Imperial superiors, some of which are closely related to him...

Elm Knight is an action game that mostly focuses on giant robot ("mech") combat. The game is set in pseudo-3D maze-like environments (with an auto-map) and is viewed from first-person perspective. Enemies (such as enemy robots) walk around in hostile areas. The playable robot, controlled by Rick, is equipped with projectile weapons of different kinds, with limited ammo. It is also possible to use melee attacks to defeat the opponents. In some areas, Rick is controlled directly (though the view and the interface are the same), and is able to use weapons such as a handgun to defend himself.</desc>

It is also possible to use melee attacks to defeat the opponents. In some areas, Rick is controlled directly (though the view and the interface are the same), and is able to use weapons such as a handgun to defend himself.</desc>

		<desc>Elm Knight is set in a futuristic world, dominated by the totalitarian regime of the Empire, which hunts down the so-called "Irregulars" - people who have supernatural abilities. The young Rick Chandler is attending the Pilot Academy, where he learns to control giant robots known as "MPS". He discovers that he might be in possession of magical abilities (which would make him an Irregular), and escapes to the desert, where he meets a girl named Selena, who directs him to the base of a rebel organization. Joining the rebels, Rick must face his Imperial superiors, some of which are closely related to him...

		<desc>In Emerald Dragon the player takes control of Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...</desc>

		<desc>In Emerald Dragon the player takes control of Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...</desc>

		<name>Enchanter</name>
		<desc>You are a dim ignorant Apprentice Enchanter, but your task is enormous.  You must save the world from the warlock Krill who is ruling the land with his evil powers. You are not the first in this quest but hopefully you will be the first to succeed, as the more experienced members of the Circle of Enchanters are powerless. You know  the basics of magic and will have the chance to learn many spells. Keep your wits and use everything you can to your benefit!

Enchanter is a text adventure set in the Zork universe, following the original Zork trilogy. As in the previous games, the player interacts with the environment by typing in text commands, usually combinations of verbs and objects. A new feature in the game is the player character's ability to cast spells. These spells must be memorized before the protagonist is able to cast them, and are learned during the course of the game. The text parser understands the names of the spells as verbs, and the player only needs to type in the spell name and the name of an object he/she wishes to cast that particular spell on.</desc>

		<desc>Escape is a RPG-like labyrinth game for medium resolution coded in assembler. 

Your mission is to find the exit of the maze. On your way to the exit you will encounter many obstacles, like bombs, magic traps, teleporters, locked doors and an infinite supply of monsters. Many things in the maze will also aid you in your quest such as bandages, first aid kits, potions, scrolls, money, weapons, rings, belts, wands, and armor. Your inventory may contain up to eight items. 

When you start the game you have no health points so it is very easy to get killed right in the beginning. Your maximum health will increase every time you kill a monster.</desc>

		<name>Eve Burst Error</name>
		<desc>Eve burst error is set in modern-day Japan. The player controls two characters: a young, seemingly careless private investigator Kojiroh, and the special agent Marina. Kojiroh has been struggling to make a living as a lone PI, but now luck seems to smile to him: the director of the Eldian International School, Mr. Ko, asks him to find a missing painting, supposedly of great value. At the same time, Marina is hired by the ambassador of the fictional Middle East republic Eldia to protect his daughter Mayako from terrorists. Switching between Kojiroh and Marina, the player gradually finds out the connection between the two cases and plunges deeper into a mystery that involves political struggle, scientific discoveries, and horrifying murders.

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure: the player interacts with the world by choosing appropriate commands from the menu (which is different for every location). There are no puzzles to solve, and the player makes progress in the game by examining the environments and talking to the characters. At certain points, it is necessary to switch between the two characters and make them cooperate.

The original version was a full-fledged  hentai game with explicit sex scenes. Subsequent releases removed those, but still contained a lot of sexual innuendo in the dialogues and images of half-naked girls.</desc>

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure: the player interacts with the world by choosing appropriate commands from the menu (which is different for every location). There are no puzzles to solve, and the player makes progress in the game by examining the environments and talking to the characters. At certain points, it is necessary to switch between the two characters and make them cooperate.

The original version was a full-fledged  hentai game with explicit sex scenes. Subsequent releases removed those, but still contained a lot of sexual innuendo in the dialogues and images of half-naked girls.</desc>

		<name>Eve Burst Error</name>
		<desc>Eve burst error is set in modern-day Japan. The player controls two characters: a young, seemingly careless private investigator Kojiroh, and the special agent Marina. Kojiroh has been struggling to make a living as a lone PI, but now luck seems to smile to him: the director of the Eldian International School, Mr. Ko, asks him to find a missing painting, supposedly of great value. At the same time, Marina is hired by the ambassador of the fictional Middle East republic Eldia to protect his daughter Mayako from terrorists.

		<desc>This is a sequel to the first Farland Story game. After Arc and his friends have defeated the evil Demon King, the brave knight was chosen to be the next king, and the lovely priestess Ferio agreed to be his wife. On the day of coronation, Arc and his little sister recall the events of the grand battle, when suddenly they hear a noise from the shrine with the Hole Sword. When they rush there, they find out the sword was taken away by demons. So, was the Demon King not defeated by Arc after all?

The game looks very similarly to its predecessor. The entire gameplay is dedicated to strategic battles, during which you navigate your large party in turn-based mode over the world map. Once you have issued commands to all your party members, it's the enemies' turn to act. You can attack enemies when they are in range of your weapon, or cast healing and offensive area spells. Your characters level up, can use items, and equip a variety of weapons and armor pieces.</desc>

		<desc>This Farland Story game (chronologically the fifth in the main series) tells a story which is not directly connected to the adventures of Arc and his friends (told in the first three games). In this game, you control Kushna, the 17-year-old princess of Sardis. Two important people wish to marry her: the young Shacliff, prince of the neighbor kingdom Rulphan, and the count Geruda. However, the princess feels she is too young to marry anybody, and escapes the castle, dreaming to find a quiet place where she could practice martial arts. The situation changes somewhat when she accidentally meets prince Shacliff himself and discovers he is in fact quite a nice fellow. And meanwhile, horde of monsters invaded the castle, and there are rumors about a rebellion... Although it has a completely different story line, this Farland Story game plays and feels exactly like its predecessors. Once again, you control a party which you can freely move on the battle terrain in turn-based mode. You first assign commands to all your party members, and then wait while the enemies execute their turns. Both you and the enemy automatically counter-attack whenever the attacker is also within the weapon's range. You gain experience points needed for leveling up directly after each attack.</desc>

		<name>Farland Story 5</name>
		<desc>This Farland Story game (chronologically the fifth in the main series) tells a story which is not directly connected to the adventures of Arc and his friends (told in the first three games). In this game, you control Kushna, the 17-year-old princess of Sardis. Two important people wish to marry her: the young Shacliff, prince of the neighbor kingdom Rulphan, and the count Geruda. However, the princess feels she is too young to marry anybody, and escapes the castle, dreaming to find a quiet place where she could practice martial arts. The situation changes somewhat when she accidentally meets prince Shacliff himself and discovers he is in fact quite a nice fellow. And meanwhile, horde of monsters invaded the castle, and there are rumors about a rebellion... Although it has a completely different story line, this Farland Story game plays and feels exactly like its predecessors. Once again, you control a party which you can freely move on the battle terrain in turn-based mode. You first assign commands to all your party members, and then wait while the enemies execute their turns. Both you and the enemy automatically counter-attack whenever the attacker is also within the weapon's range. You gain experience points needed for leveling up directly after each attack.</desc>

		<name>File</name>
		<desc>In File, the player takes the role of young man named Pat, who is working for a powerful state security organization in an unspecified English-speaking country. His boss, a mysterious high-ranked agent named Cropp, tells him about a strictly classified project under the codename IBIS, which was intended as a counter-terror measure. Four young women have been apprehended under suspicious circumstances (amnesia following an accident, proximity to weapon research facility, etc.). Pat's task is to interrogate those women and to find out the truth about their activities.

In the beginning of the game the protagonist is shown all the four dossiers, and the player can choose to play the four interrogations in any order. The game has a typical Japanese-adventure interface with verb commands ("Look", "Talk", "Think") and some specific commands during particular situations. The game advances through continuous usage of these commands. 

The interrogation of the girls always leads to sexual situations - consensual or not. The game has scenes with explicit sexual content.</desc>

		<name>Foreigner</name>
		<desc>Klaus is a young man who has seen Jessica, the love of his life, killed in front of his eyes. Blaming himself for not being able to stop it, Klaus joins a group of mercenaries. Traveling together with his friends Bayse and Miria, Klaus encounters Stella, the princess of Valnausha. After the princess gets kidnapped, Klaus swears that he'll do everything he can to bring her back...

Foreigner is a RPG with a navigation system and interaction reminiscent of Japanese adventures. Menu-based commands ("Look", "Talk", etc.) are present at every screen, and the game lacks physical movement: even in hostile areas (dungeons), the player moves around by selecting screens on a mini-map, which takes him to the next picture. The RPG angle is traditional Japanese style, minus the physical navigation; when Klaus and his party are attacked, a combat screen with battle commands ("Attack, "Magic", etc.) appears. It is possible to buy items and weapons, and the heroes gain experience points and level up in a standard RPG fashion.

There is sexual innuendo and mild nudity in the game, but no explicit sex.</desc>

		<name>Foxy</name>
		<desc>The story of Foxy is rather basic: a hostile army from a country known simply as "Red" attacks the capital city of the "Blue" nation. Not only the enemy tries to invade the most important strategic points of the city - enemy generals also try to capture and enslave the "Blue" girls! Naturally, they must be stopped! As the commander of the Blue army, it's the player's task to face enemy forces in battles, rescue the girls, and drive the Reds out of the city.

Foxy is a pure strategy game, without any RPG elements. The player is taken from one battle to another; there is no gameplay outside of battles. The battles take place in various city districts. The player navigates his/her units in turn-based fashion. In the beginning, the battles are relatively small-scale, with infantry and tank units; as the game progresses, more unit types are introduced, including massive rocket-launching tanks, jet planes, catapults, etc.

Each unit has distinct advantages and disadvantages, different mobility, attack range, etc. For example, infantry units that carry rocket launchers can only attack diagonally, but cannot be hurt when they attack tanks from that position; being attacked frontally, however, makes them very vulnerable. Terrain also plays a role; certain terrain types may slow down certain unit types, or be completely impassable to others. Each next battle features more complex layouts and larger amounts of units.

Between the battles there are cut-scenes, most of which are dedicated to rescuing the girls, and feature nudity and mild sexual situations.</desc>

		<name>Foxy</name>
		<desc>The story of Foxy is rather basic: a hostile army from a country known simply as "Red" attacks the capital city of the "Blue" nation. Not only the enemy tries to invade the most important strategic points of the city - enemy generals also try to capture and enslave the "Blue" girls! Naturally, they must be stopped! As the commander of the Blue army, it's the player's task to face enemy forces in battles, rescue the girls, and drive the Reds out of the city.

Foxy is a pure strategy game, without any RPG elements. The player is taken from one battle to another; there is no gameplay outside of battles. The battles take place in various city districts. The player navigates his/her units in turn-based fashion. In the beginning, the battles are relatively small-scale, with infantry and tank units; as the game progresses, more unit types are introduced, including massive rocket-launching tanks, jet planes, catapults, etc.

Each unit has distinct advantages and disadvantages, different mobility, attack range, etc. For example, infantry units that carry rocket launchers can only attack diagonally, but cannot be hurt when they attack tanks from that position; being attacked frontally, however, makes them very vulnerable. Terrain also plays a role; certain terrain types may slow down certain unit types, or be completely impassable to others. Each next battle features more complex layouts and larger amounts of units.

Between the battles there are cut-scenes, most of which are dedicated to rescuing the girls, and feature nudity and mild sexual situations.</desc>

		<name>Gaias Lord</name>
		<desc>The hero of this game, named Zenith, has borrowed too much money. The village inhabitants just beat him up, but the village elder has other plans. It appears that several young girls have been missing lately. As a punishment, Zenith must venture to the nearby tower, infested by all kinds of monsters and demons, and see if he could find the girls there.

Gaias Lord is an action game with a lot of environmental puzzles, most of which involves pushing crates to clear the way through the top-down dungeon, accessing treasure chests, keys, and other important items. There are also enemies wandering around the tower, whom Zenith can fight in real-time combat, using his sword or special techniques. There are slight RPG elements, as Zenith can equip various weapons and armors scattered through the dungeon.

The game has anime-style cut scenes, some of which feature nudity and sexual situations.</desc>

There are slight RPG elements, as Zenith can equip various weapons and armors scattered through the dungeon.

The game has anime-style cut scenes, some of which feature nudity and sexual situations.</desc>

It appears that several young girls have been missing lately. As a punishment, Zenith must venture to the nearby tower, infested by all kinds of monsters and demons, and see if he could find the girls there.

		<desc>Minako was just an ordinary Japanese teenage girl - until she was killed by an evil gym teacher, whom she dared to oppose. However, she was resurrected with the help of cyborg technology, operated by a mysterious creature with a normal Japanese surname Yoda - and yes, he looks just like the famous character from  Star Wars. Yoda explains to Minako that her school has been possessed by demons, one of which is her former gym teacher, now turned principal! Minako heads back to her school, determined to demonstrate her new skills to the forces of evil!

Looks like all those cybernetic enhancements served just one purpose: enrich Minako's knowledge of contemporary Japanese pop culture. Because the only gameplay in this game involves answering timed trivia questions. The moment Minako encounters an opponent, the screen displays a fake battle field, and the quiz begins. If the player answers correctly, Minako causes damage to her opponent; if the answer is wrong, Minako sustains damage herself. Too many wrong answers result in Minako's death, this time irrevocable.

Extensive cut-scenes occupy the space between those "quiz battles". Most of them are heavy on explicit sexual content.</desc>

Minako heads back to her school, determined to demonstrate her new skills to the forces of evil!

Looks like all those cybernetic enhancements served just one purpose: enrich Minako's knowledge of contemporary Japanese pop culture. Because the only gameplay in this game involves answering timed trivia questions. The moment Minako encounters an opponent, the screen displays a fake battle field, and the quiz begins. If the player answers correctly, Minako causes damage to her opponent; if the answer is wrong, Minako sustains damage herself. Too many wrong answers result in Minako's death, this time irrevocable.

Extensive cut-scenes occupy the space between those "quiz battles". Most of them are heavy on explicit sexual content.</desc>

		<name>Galaga</name>
		<desc>Galaga is a vertical arcade shooter from Namco.  You control a space fighter at the bottom of the screen, scrolling left and right in order to avoid oncoming bombs and kamikaze attacks from alien invaders--and to fire your own missiles to fight back!

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</desc>

The remake features a re-vamped interface, more advanced graphics and sound, and over 30 scenarios (more are available on separately released scenario disks). The scenarios include the three classic "try" maps (one with ground combat only, one with ground and aerial combat, one with ground and naval combat), as well as new scenarios with a varied degree of difficulty and tasks. 

Some of the scenarios also allow the player to engage in a war between multiple countries (up to 5). Included in the game is a scenario editor, which allows the player to create his own maps from scratch.</desc>

		<desc>Jackie was having an ordinary life which seemed to culminate with an intimate intercourse with his sweetheart Mika. However, shortly afterwards he met a mysterious old woman who prophesied his imminent death. He was then transferred to the magical Realm Above the Clouds populated by humans and demons alike. Jackie has to find a way to return to our world and save Mika, who is considered a powerful goddess of love among the indigenous people.

Giga Mortion is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game viewed from an isometric perspective. Enemies appear randomly and the battles are turn-based. The player controls Jackie and two female characters who eventually join the party and can use magic spells as well as physical attacks. Leveling up is done in the automatic fashion characteristic of the genre. The game features adult cutscenes, some of which are animated.</desc>

		<name>Girls Paradise</name>
		<desc>The protagonist of the game is an eighteen-year-old boy whose destiny is to defeat a legendary demon, thus ending the Age of Darkness. As the hero embarks on his journey, he realizes that he must have chosen a wrong destination, for he becomes stranded on a tropical island that seems to be populated entirely by women. No, the hero does not abandon his world-saving mission because of that; but in order to leave the island, he needs to perform various quests for its young and pretty female inhabitants, which more often than not involve demonstrating... err... somewhat intimate aspects of his heroic nature. Girls Paradise is an adventure game without real puzzles and with menu-based interface; however, it differs from most typical Japanese adventures by allowing (and requiring) the player to find and pick up certain items and then use them from the inventory to advance in the game.</desc>

		<name>Goice</name>
		<desc>Goice contains three episodes, which tell three separate stories, but share the same villains: human-looking aliens under the command of the insane female captain Storm, and an army of mechanical dolls they use to kidnap and rape young girls from the Earth. 

The first episode focuses on two girls, Harue and Kyoko, who survive a car crash caused by the appearance of a giant foll that attacks the city in a Godzilla fashion, only to be captured by an army of smaller once, brought to Strom's space ship, and raped in various ways.

The second episode focuses on three very young high school girls, who hear a mysterious voice on the street and run to seek help by a classmate, but are sexually assaulted by the horny alien dolls.

The heroes of the third episode are two young martial artists, the boy Kenji and the girl Kaede; Kaede is kidnapped and raped by Strom and her hermaphrodite subordinate, and Kenji is trying to recue her.

Goice is almost entirely pornographic; by far the largest bulk of the game is dedicated to explicit sex scenes accompanied by long passages of text. Most of the sex scenes feature short loop-like animation. The stories are entirely linear, but some scenes offer interactivity in form of a point-and-click interface, with the cursor automatically turning into the only available action on the only available spot. This interaction is used only to deplete the available actions and advance the plot.</desc>

However, seeing how all the doctors, nurses, and patients turn out to be gorgeous young women, the hero quickly forgets the Hippocratic oath in favor of his less altruist, but more basic instincts...

		<name>Gokko Vol. 02 School Gal's</name>
		<desc>Gokko Vol. 02: School Gal's (sic) is very similar in structure to the  previous volume, but - as the title implies - with a different theme. The player controls a young male protagonist (default name Lance), who has spotted a beautiful girl near the gate of the prestigious Finlandia Girls High School. He is determined to gain access to the school, which is also attended by his sister. Though men are strictly prohibited from entering the school building, the hero is resourceful enough to find a way in; what happens afterwards should be clear to anyone familiar with the many high school-themed  bishoujo games...

The game plays very similarly to its predecessor, though the player has somewhat more freedom of choice and options this time. It walks a fine line between a "normal" Japanese-style adventure and visual novel, though due to lack of a fixed verb-based command menu it should probably belong to the latter. Most of the choices are there simply to try and see the responses; however, some of them lead to dead-end situations, which eventually result in Game Over.</desc>

		<name>Gokko Vol. 02 School Gal's</name>
		<desc>Gokko Vol. 02: School Gal's (sic) is very similar in structure to the  previous volume, but - as the title implies - with a different theme. The player controls a young male protagonist (default name Lance), who has spotted a beautiful girl near the gate of the prestigious Finlandia Girls High School. He is determined to gain access to the school, which is also attended by his sister. Though men are strictly prohibited from entering the school building, the hero is resourceful enough to find a way in; what happens afterwards should be clear to anyone familiar with the many high school-themed  bishoujo games...

The game plays very similarly to its predecessor, though the player has somewhat more freedom of choice and options this time. It walks a fine line between a "normal" Japanese-style adventure and visual novel, though due to lack of a fixed verb-based command menu it should probably belong to the latter. Most of the choices are there simply to try and see the responses; however, some of them lead to dead-end situations, which eventually result in Game Over.</desc>

		<desc>Long time ago, human passions caused the appearance of a monster tribe that has since become unwelcome in the human society. Years of bitter antagonism and violence followed as humans settled in the land of Galesnia. A thousand years later, a simple warrior named Grog enters a forest inhabited by monsters, and becomes gradually involved in a struggle that puts him in the forefront of the defense of Galesnia.

Guernica is a Japanese-style role-playing game with radically simplified gameplay mechanics. There is no party, no monetary system, and no equipment of any kind. Only bars and inns can be accessed in towns. The world map is completely linear, as the protagonist is only able to move on the roads and locations appear on it only when triggered by the plot. Much of the game consists of exploring hostile locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat that allows only physical attacks and usage of healing items that are randomly dropped by the foes. The game's cutscenes mostly depict explicit sexual encounters.</desc>

		<name>Gunblaze</name>
		<desc>The events of this game take place in London, in the second half of the 19th century. Mark Flint is a young private detective. One day he sees several men assault a young girl near his apartment. He saves the girl, only to discover that he has seen her face already on a wanted poster. But the girl (whose name is Jewel) explains that she is being hunted by the mysterious society of Rosenkreuz. Her father was a great scientist who knew how to make items out of pure ether; his zeppelin was attacked, and the Rosenkreuz are after the ether-made necklace Jewel is wearing. Mark, Jewel, and their friends have to find a way to defeat the Rosenkreuz and their leader, the ambitious Irene, who won't stop until the entire world is under her control...

GunBlaze plays like a story-driven Japanese RPG, with the real-world setting adding some unusual gameplay elements. Most of the game takes place in urban locations (such as the city of London); instead of a world map, there is a city map with locations marked on it. Despite the fantasy elements, the game tries to keep the realistic setting without supernatural or sci-fi themes - for example, there are no magic spells or any equivalent powers. The heroes fight with guns, for which they have to buy bullets, and which require re-loading during combat.

Otherwise, GunBlaze preserves traditional Japanese RPG gameplay elements such as linear plot progression, simple character development system (leveling up), random enemies, turn-based battle engine, etc.

Despite the historical European setting, GunBlaze has typically Japanese manga/anime-style character design. The game has nudity and sexual content, though it can be considered softcore.</desc>

The heroes fight with guns, for which they have to buy bullets, and which require re-loading during combat.

Otherwise, GunBlaze preserves traditional Japanese RPG gameplay elements such as linear plot progression, simple character development system (leveling up), random enemies, turn-based battle engine, etc.

Despite the historical European setting, GunBlaze has typically Japanese manga/anime-style character design. The game has nudity and sexual content, though it can be considered softcore.</desc>

		<desc>The events of this game take place in London, in the second half of the 19th century. Mark Flint is a young private detective. One day he sees several men assault a young girl near his apartment. He saves the girl, only to discover that he has seen her face already on a wanted poster. But the girl (whose name is Jewel) explains that she is being hunted by the mysterious society of Rosenkreuz. Her father was a great scientist who knew how to make items out of pure ether; his zeppelin was attacked, and the Rosenkreuz are after the ether-made necklace Jewel is wearing. Mark, Jewel, and their friends have to find a way to defeat the Rosenkreuz and their leader, the ambitious Irene, who won't stop until the entire world is under her control...

GunBlaze plays like a story-driven Japanese RPG, with the real-world setting adding some unusual gameplay elements. Most of the game takes place in urban locations (such as the city of London); instead of a world map, there is a city map with locations marked on it. Despite the fantasy elements, the game tries to keep the realistic setting without supernatural or sci-fi themes - for example, there are no magic spells or any equivalent powers. The heroes fight with guns, for which they have to buy bullets, and which require re-loading during combat.

Otherwise, GunBlaze preserves traditional Japanese RPG gameplay elements such as linear plot progression, simple character development system (leveling up), random enemies, turn-based battle engine, etc.

Despite the historical European setting, GunBlaze has typically Japanese manga/anime-style character design. The game has nudity and sexual content, though it can be considered softcore.</desc>

		<name>Hamlet</name>
		<desc>Hamlet is a redacted version of the famous play of the same name by William Shakespeare and presented as an adventure with a cartoon style. In the kingdom of Denmark Claudius and his assistant Polonius kill the king and queen to seize the throne. It is decided that Polonius' daughter Ophelia should marry Claudius, but then Hamlet, the prince of Denmark, returns from a long journey. Before he has the chance to avenge his parents and free Ophelia, a man from the future on a research mission lands his space ship on Hamlet, accidentally killing him. Since Hamlet is out of the picture, the unknown man decides to become a hero and free Ophelia himself.

Loosely based on the events of the play, the player guides the man through five acts to free Ophelia from the clutches of Claudius. The overall story is more or less maintained, with familiar characters such as Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and Laertes, but Polonius for instance is a green man in a space suit. Using a humorous style the unknown man needs to solve many puzzles in a typical point-and-click adventure style. As it is aimed towards a casual audience, a number of typical elements is not present, such as a conversation system, an inventory, item combinations, or different actions. Each puzzle is set in a single scene where the player needs to click objects in the environment to manipulate them. Puzzles range from simple combinations to much harder challenges that require some trial and error, and sometimes quick reflexes. It is impossible for the main character to die. The main character can be clicked to see his thoughts and sometimes this is a requirement to solve a puzzle. When the solution to a scene has not been found after several minutes, a question mark appears to receive a hint.</desc>

		<name>Hana No Kioku</name>
		<desc>Hana no Kioku consists of five episodes, all of which can be accessed from the main menu, in no particular order:
The young school girl Chiko is taking a subway train and is sexually molested by what she thinks is a chihan (a person with the popular Japanese "hobby" of touching young girls on the trains). However, the chihan turns out to be a young girl named Kiko, who wears a rather elaborate disguise.

 An episode dedicated to another popular Japanese theme: tentacle sex. A young girl named Mei thinks about anime stories and brave heroes who defeat monsters; at that moment, she is sexually assaulted by a horribly-looking giant squid monster.

Mei is back in school, but this time she is not the player-controlled character; the latter is now a female teacher named Sumi, who has ordered Mei to stay in the classroom after the lesson, in order to have sex with her.

A school girl named Saki is sick and is lying on the bed in the school hospital. From that point, the story can branch two different ways: either she is being raped by Sumi, or seduced by the nurse Aki.

 Back to Kiko from the first story; she is the playable character now, and, depending on the story branch, she either waits for her boyfriend and has sex with him, or goes outside in a disguise already seen in the first episode mentioned.All the episodes are visual novels with very little interaction; the player is only allowed to make a few choices. However, the choices usually change the direction of the events significantly, up to the point of leading to completely different situations.</desc>

		<desc>Two thousand years ago, a great hero has defeated the demon lord Gargantua, with the help of a magical sword and a young sorceress. Time has passed, and the sword was inherited by the descendants of the hero. The two last ones are brothers, named Cain and Abel. While Abel has proved himself as a great warrior, Cain prefers to stay in his home village and chase pretty girls. But one day, he has a strange dream. A woman who calls herself the Goddess of Time appears and tells him that Gargantua is about to be revived. Cain first tries to ignore the dream, but soon a series of strange events convinces him that the time has come to prove himself a hero.

Harlem Blade is a rather traditional Japanese RPG with top-down navigation (can be done with arrow keys or in a point-and-click fashion with the mouse) and a world-map with linear routes. Enemies appear randomly, with battle screens superimposed on exploration backgrounds. It is possible to speed up the battles by setting them on Auto. Characters level up, buy equipment, use magic and items, and otherwise follow standard Japanese RPG procedures, with the addition of scenes that contain nudity.</desc>

		<desc>Unlike the  first Idol Project, the story of the sequel is directly related to to the anime series Idol Project, starring the same characters, with the young and ambitious Mimu Emilton as the protagonist. Mimu finds herself on a tropical island, where she must rise to fame by winning contests and promoting her singing skills. Like in the previous game, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to exploring the top-down city, visiting various places, searching for necessary people and raising the protagonist's parameters. Mimu has a much more detailed set of parameters than the hero of the previous game, including physical attributes as well as popularity rankings. The RPG element has been further enhanced by introducing random character (crazed fans and alike) who would sometimes attack Mimu on the city map and other locations.

Like the anime, Idol Project 2 has somewhat sexy, but "cute" graphics, as opposed to the adult overtones of the predecessor.</desc>

		<desc>IF contains four scenarios, which are unrelated to each other and can be accessed directly from the main menu:
 The first scenario stars a 19-year-old young man who accidentally makes a wish and summons a cute-looking female demon, who is ready to serve his "master"... in various ways, including what you just thought.

 This scenario is sub-titled Triangle, and is dedicated to a high-school student who has a rather uneasy relationship with the girl he likes. One day he meets a female childhood friend, which further complicates his love life...

 Set in medieval (feudal) Japan, the scenario tells the story of a young man who is on his way to the capital city, to study martial arts by a famous teacher. He gets sick and has to stay in a mountain village. Soon he notices that strange things begin to happen there, and has to find a way to release a woman from a curse that was placed on her.

 The last scenario is set in a small village that lies deep in a forest, in a fictional country, and focuses on a young boy named Indy. He fancies the daughter of the village elder; one day she is kidnapped by strangers, and Indy swears to rescue her.All the scenarios have the gameplay of a visual novel: the player reads the vast amount of text that accompanies the pictures, choosing actions or dialogue choices from time to time. The first two scenarios feature branching story and Game Over moments; the two others develop in a linear fashion and have only one ending.</desc>

		<desc>IF 2 contains three separate scenarios (as opposed to four of the  previous game); they are numbered 5, 6, and 7 (continuing the count from the first IF), but have no relation story-wise either to the preceding scenarios or each other.
 "Scenario 5" is a rare example of "mainstream" eroge which deals with a male homosexual relationship. The adult content here is text-only; there are no graphics that depict explicit sex. The hero of the game is a young man who lives together with his boyfriend. A girl who works with him in the company seems fancy him, and the protagonist has to deal with her advances and his partner's jealousy, questioning his own orientation in progress.

 This scenario has a branching story line; the premise is that the hero, a college student, is desperate to find a date. The episode is dedicated only to one day of the hero's life; during this day, he must locate and convince a girl to have a date with him. Depending on the player's choices, the story develops in various different directions from there.

 The final, "seventh" scenario stars a female protagonist, a high-school student named Kumi. One night she dreams of her male classmate having a romantic relationship with her. Upon arriving in the school, however, she sees another girl obviously trying to seduce the man of her dreams. Will she be able to reclaim him for herself - and if so, by what means?..The gameplay in IF 2 is similar to that of the previous game, though the branching story line concept is somewhat deeper and more complicated. There are more choices to make, and they have a more significant impact on the development on the story. Particularly the second episode is notable for being more open-ended, but also unforgiving and leading to premature endings if the player doesn't choose the right things to do and/or to say.</desc>

		<desc>Like its predecessors in the  series, IF 3 contains three scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played directly from the main menu:
 The first episode, sub-titled Will for Suicide, is indeed about that: a person who tries to commit suicide. The scenario can be played in two different ways, from the point of view of either a male or female protagonist. reasons and circumstances of the suicide can also be chosen by the player. The scenario involves supernatural forces that change the fate of the heroes; however, the specific narrative is defined by the player.

 This episode is called Like a Magic Woman; the heroine is a beautiful young woman, contemplating about her future career and desire for money; at that moment, she is hit by a truck. Miraculously, she survives the accident, and is granted the magic ability of shape-shifting.

 The final episode is entitled Eday &amp; Magy (sic), which are the misspelled names "Eddie" and "Maggie". The setting is a fictional city in the USA called "Autumn City"; it is being governed by the powerful Chief Anderson, enjoying an era of stability and peace. But a criminal organization targets Eddie, a young half-Japanese police officer, and he receives the assignment to bring the villains to justice.The gameplay is visual novel-style; while the second and the third episodes feature few choices and the story develops more linearly (though some choices do influence the narrative as well), the first episode is more open-ended, also containing several premature endings that should be avoided.</desc>

		<name>If 3</name>
		<desc>Like its predecessors in the  series, IF 3 contains three scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played directly from the main menu:
 The first episode, sub-titled Will for Suicide, is indeed about that: a person who tries to commit suicide. The scenario can be played in two different ways, from the point of view of either a male or female protagonist. reasons and circumstances of the suicide can also be chosen by the player. The scenario involves supernatural forces that change the fate of the heroes; however, the specific narrative is defined by the player.

 This episode is called Like a Magic Woman; the heroine is a beautiful young woman, contemplating about her future career and desire for money; at that moment, she is hit by a truck. Miraculously, she survives the accident, and is granted the magic ability of shape-shifting.

 The final episode is entitled Eday &amp; Magy (sic), which are the misspelled names "Eddie" and "Maggie". The setting is a fictional city in the USA called "Autumn City"; it is being governed by the powerful Chief Anderson, enjoying an era of stability and peace. But a criminal organization targets Eddie, a young half-Japanese police officer, and he receives the assignment to bring the villains to justice.The gameplay is visual novel-style; while the second and the third episodes feature few choices and the story develops more linearly (though some choices do influence the narrative as well), the first episode is more open-ended, also containing several premature endings that should be avoided.</desc>

Controlling the cunning professor, you must seduce Reiko by selecting correct choices that are presented to you at almost any given point, avoiding disturbances such as the ugly housekeeper in Reiko's house.</desc>

		<desc>You play "Professor" Hitosuji, well-known reputed tutor and teacher for his abilities in turning even the worst students into straight A stars...although it might be just a coincidence that all those girls happen to be very young and beautiful students. His "private tutoring skills" might be somewhat questionable, but it works.

In Immoral Study 2, the task at hand is to tutor one Yuko Ijima, the only daughter of a big time factory CEO. She's been slipping in her grades lately and her father called you to put her back on the right track again. Oh, she has a major attitude problem. Nothing you can't handle though.

Another linear hentai game where all you have to do is click on the mouse from beginning to end, which surprisingly is a very short game by the way (less than an hour). It does come with voice support and pretty nice animated graphics, although it is partially censored.</desc>

		<name>Irium</name>
		<desc>The world Irium is a world ruled by magic. One of the most powerful magicians of Irium, the young and lovely Seria, decided to pay a visit to the magic-less world which is our Earth. There, she met a young man; they fell in love, and had a child together. But Seria eventually had to return to Irium. The child, who was named Masaya, grew up on the Earth and turned to be a normal teenager, unaware of the magical powers sealed within him - until a messenger from Irium appears on the Earth and tells him that their world is in great trouble, and he is the only one who can save it...

Despite heavy amounts of text, dialogues, and an adventure-like interface (with a menu of verb commands) for all the locations except the dungeons, Irium is still a RPG in its core, more specifically a first-person dungeon crawler. The player controls a party consisting of Masaya and up to three female companions. The dungeons are identically-looking pseudo-3D mazes (with an auto-map), which have to be explored and safely traversed to reach the destination dictated by the story. Enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based. Some of the characters learn offensive and supportive magic, used in combat or outside of it. 

There are sex scenes in the game, all of them rather "softcore" (comparable to those seen in  Knight of Xentar or other  Elf games). The player has no control over their outcome, but has to select menu commands to advance.</desc>

		<desc>Kenta is an ordinary Japanese teenager who enjoys his high school life. One day, he receives an anonymous letter, apparently from a girl, who says she likes him, and wants to meet him in an abandoned school building. However, upon arriving there, he finds that several of his classmates and teachers (mostly female) are there as well. When Kenta realizes they were lured there, it is already too late - they are locked in the building, unable to get out. Kenta must find a way to save his friends... but what if he can't save them all?..

Though a Japanese game, Isaku is a point-and-click adventure with inventory and puzzles, resembling Western adventures more than its compatriots gameplay-wise. The game is viewed from first-person perspective; while individual locations are presented as still images, the connecting corridors are done in pseudo-3D and can be physically navigated. 

Objects (and people) that can be interacted with are highlighted, offering one or more actions to perform. The gameplay mostly involves exploring the rooms and collecting the necessary information or items to unlock new areas. 

The player is also able to make decisions during the gameplay concerning Kenta's relationship with the various female characters. Depending on these decisions, Kenta will be able to become romantically involved with a girl of the player's choice.

The adult scenes in the game are very rare and occur only during the ending sequence, or in case Kenta allows one of the girls to be directly captured by the evil mastermind behind their imprisonment.</desc>

		<desc>The protagonist of the game, a young Japanese male, visits a small town and witnesses two thugs assaulting a terrified young woman. Unable to help her, the hero leaves the town and forgets about the incident.

Two years later, he is back in that town; but shortly after having arrived, he is attacked on the street, and robbed of all his possessions. Now he has to get to the bottom of the mystery, but first he needs money. Since the town is big on mahjong tournaments, the hero decides to get his money back by playing that game, at the same time investigating the townspeople... in more than one way.

Jan Jaka Jan is a  mahjong game in its core, the majority of the gameplay dedicated to mahjong matches (two- as well as four-people) against a variety of opponents. The player can navigate the protagonist around the top-down town and enter various locations, which are viewed from first-person perspective. 

The player is also able to buy items to increase his parameters during mahjong matches and encounters of sexual nature.

Cut scenes occur before and after mahjong games, and many matches and other events are dictated by the story. Defeating a female mahjong opponent usually leads to cut scenes that depict nudity and sexual situations.</desc>

		<name>Jealousy</name>
		<desc>An ordinary Japanese young man named Fujibayashi Kotarou was playing a computer game at his friend's house. Upon returning home at night, he was approached by mobsters, who demanded money. With debts everywhere and without real means to earn money, Kotarou opts to work for a dubious night club manager as a host. He finds it hard to adjust to the new life style, which brings not only danger and violence, but also sexual experiences he hasn't even dreamed of before...

Jealousy can be classified as a visual novel, though the choices the player makes during the game tend to have little impact on the story progression, and are quite rare. Most of the game consists of text accompanied by pictures or (more rarely) animated scenes of sexual nature.</desc>

		<name>Joker</name>
		<desc>Joker is set in the time period commonly known as the "Old West" or "Wild West" in the United States of America. The protagonist of the game is a young man nicknamed Wild, who lives in a quiet Native American village. Years ago, the village was hit by something its inhabitants have since called "The Great Disaster". In order to seal the forces that caused the catastrophe, Wild's father sacrificed his own life. Now, the ceremonial day of the White Magic approaches. The youngest in the line of witches, a girl named Laura, must predict the future for the village and the world. For an unknown reason, Laura is unable to see into the future. Concerned, the village elder sends Wild on a mission to the nearby town, to find out what could cause this and if there is a way to prevent the Great Disaster from returning...

Joker is essentially a Japanese-style adventure, with strictly menu-based interface, still screens viewed from first-person perspective, and no real puzzles. However, the game offers more interaction possibilities and less linear progression than it is usually the case in comparable games. The player must explore the town and talk to its inhabitants in order to advance the story and get to the bottom of the mystery.

The game has scenes with nudity and rather mild depictions of sexual situations.</desc>

		<desc>The game's hero, a young man named Otomegawa, encounter Chururu, a cheerful female magical creature, who accidentally curses him to become a woman. Only the princess of the Magic Land can lift the curse. The princess has been reborn as a human being and is currently living on the Earth. The problem is that as a human, she has no access to her magical powers that would help Otomegawa solve his predicament. Only a moment of true ecstasy (and since this is a  hentai game, we all know what it means) will awaken her true potential! Luckily, the princess also happens to be lesbian, which perfectly suits Otomegawa's current condition and the means necessary to achieve the goal...

JYB is structure like a Japanese-style adventure game, with menu-based interaction featuring omnipresent commands such as "Look", "Talk", "Think", etc. The locations are displayed as small interior images and character graphics super-imposed over the background of the city map. Most of the activity involves visiting different locations on the map, trying to figure out where the princess is and how to seduce her. Elements of "dating simulation" in form of money system and possibility to purchase items are also present.</desc>

		<desc>Nikki, the hero of the game, is a cybernetically enhanced young man from the future. His "home time" is the beginning of 22th century; his home town is the international megalopolis Shinjuku City, part of the old Tokyo. Humanity prospers, living in pleasure, relying on incredible scientific achievements. One of them is the time machine. Nikki finds out than four young, attractive school girls from 1994 got involved into some sort of trouble. Using his time machine, Nikki ventures into the past, determined to save them... and expecting a lot of... err... gratitude in return!

Kaiketsu Nikki is an adventure game in essence, with features somewhat unusual for a Japanese representative of the genre. As in most Japanese adventures, the interaction is done via verb commands selected from the menu. The player clicks on an object, which bring up the menu with the commands. However, while there are still no real puzzles, the challenge lies in completing certain actions in time, in order to avoid time paradoxes while staying in the past. The player must explore thoroughly the rooms of the four girls and figure out a way to conquer them.</desc>

		<name>Kanako</name>
		<desc>Kanako is a young woman who has just graduated from college and is in a desperate need of a job. Finally, she is invited to a job interview in a large and successful company. However, the boss seems to ask too many personal questions and generally looks at Kanako in a weird way. After she has been introduced to her duties at the new place, Kanako decides to get to know the employees better, and in process learns their most intimate secrets...

The game is a rather standard Japanese-style adventure; the interface consists of a menu with verb commands ("Examine", "Talk", etc.), which usually lead to sub-menus of objects or conversation topics. Navigation is also done via an appropriate menu command.</desc>

		<name>Kankin</name>
		<desc>The year is 2197. In order to be able to compete with the leading powers of the world, Japan was urbanized, huge city areas covering the entire country. In these huge, soulless cities, crime thrives. Violence is part of everyday life. Female police agents Sagoto, Kikuno, and Chisame are sent to Koube City to arrest drug dealers. But all goes wrong in the very beginning, and the young women fall victims to vicious criminals. 

Kankin has none of the classic (since  Mokkoriman RPG)  Illusion gameplay elements, and is low on interactivity even compared to other Japanese adventures. The player's input is reduced to choosing available menu options. Wrong choices may sometimes lead to Game Over, but most of the time the player has to go through all the options several times to make the story advance. There is no character movement whatsoever in the game, and the characters from whose point of view the story is told change with each scene, and include other minor characters beside the three main heroines.

"Kankin" shares its dark futuristic setting and several characters (such as Kikuno and others) with other Illusion games, in particular its follow-up  Requiem Hurts: Kankin.</desc>

There is no character movement whatsoever in the game, and the characters from whose point of view the story is told change with each scene, and include other minor characters beside the three main heroines.

"Kankin" shares its dark futuristic setting and several characters (such as Kikuno and others) with other Illusion games, in particular its follow-up  Requiem Hurts: Kankin.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2197. In order to be able to compete with the leading powers of the world, Japan was urbanized, huge city areas covering the entire country. In these huge, soulless cities, crime thrives. Violence is part of everyday life. Female police agents Sagoto, Kikuno, and Chisame are sent to Koube City to arrest drug dealers. But all goes wrong in the very beginning, and the young women fall victims to vicious criminals. 

Kankin has none of the classic (since  Mokkoriman RPG)  Illusion gameplay elements, and is low on interactivity even compared to other Japanese adventures.

		<desc>Karei naru Jinsei 2 is a board/dating simulation game, very similar to its  predecessor. As in the first game, players can compete against each other or against computer AI in an adult-themed board game, with the eventual goal of having sex with various female characters.

There are more girls and a larger variety of items to buy than in the first game. There are specialized shops (boutique, adult, etc.) which offer more items for sale. The basic gameplay is the same (each player starts a "roulette" which determines the amount of squares he can move on the board). However, an additional "event roulette" has been added, which resembles a slot machine. This roulette influences the player characters' parameters, money, etc.</desc>

		<desc>Rokuro Saito is an ordinary Japanese high school student. Summer vacation has arrived, and, as it often happens, he is out of money. Then he hears that Kawarazaki, a wealthy and powerful magnate, needs someone to take care of his mansion during his absence. When the boy arrives there, he is surprised to discover that the mansion is mostly populated by young attractive women - relatives, employees, maids, etc. Naturally, he is willing to concentrate on his job only inasmuch as it doesn't impede his advancements on the other "mission" - get friendly with every girl and... you know the drill. However, soon he begins to realize that something more sinister is going on in the mansion...

Kawarazakike no Ichizoku is a visual novel. The entire gameplay consists of occasional selection of a response and/or action from a menu. The rest of the game is dedicated to text accompanied by still pictures. Depending on the player's choices, different cutscenes will be triggered, and the player will achieve different endings, including several "bad" ones.</desc>

		<name>Kohakuiro No Yuigon</name>
		<desc>Kohakuiro no Yuigon ("Amber Testament") is the first in the row of detective games starring the fictional Japanese private investigator Ryūnosuke Tōdō. The events of the game take places in Japan in the year 1921, and Tōdō must investigate a mysterious murder of a rich man in his own mansion. The deceased had many relatives, and its the detective's job to find out which one of them (if any) has committed the murder.

The game plays mostly like an adventure with light simulation elements. The interaction is done with menu commands, focusing on conversation topics. The protagonist has to talk to the mansion's inhabitants about other people and hear their opinion concerning the crime, unlocking new topics as he gathers information. Rooms can and should be searched for clues as well. In his own room the detective can view dossiers and evidence.</desc>

		<desc>Haruki is a student at the prestigious private Morino High School, which he attends together with his beautiful sister, and where he leads the drama class. One day, Haruki discovers a strange toupee that transforms his body. Unbeknownst to him, he has gained special powers and comes into contact with a strange violent world that is hidden inside the school. Now he must understand what's truly going on there, at the same time trying to "score" with every girl he meets - be it student or teacher...

Kousoku Chojin plays like a cross between a "normal" Japanese-style adventure and a visual novel. The player has some freedom in choosing the locations he wants Haruki to visit, which triggers specific conversations and scenes. However, there is no other interaction with the game world beside this menu-based navigation - no possibility to actively examine objects, talk to people, etc.</desc>

		<desc>On a cold Christmas night, the male hero of the game enters a large building, hoping to find a warm place. But the elevator he enters is malfunctioning. After a short while he finds himself trapped in the elevator, unable to get out. As his eyes adjust to the darkness, he realizes that a young woman is inside the elevator as well. The two must find a way out, and also learn about each other's lives in the process...

Kurayami (meaning "darkness") is a visual novel concentrating on dialogue and decision-making within the confined setting of a broken elevator and developing relationship between the hero and the young woman. Depending on the player's choices, their relationship will evolve in different ways, leading to different endings.

The game contains scenes with nudity and sexual situations.</desc>

		<name>Kuroneko Kan</name>
		<desc>The game's protagonist is a young man named Okita. His friend Murakami has recently found a part-time job: housework in the Kuroneko ("Black Cat") mansion, which belongs to a rich and mysterious family. However, since then, Okita hasn't received a word from his friend. Worried about this strange silence, Okita travels to the mansion. There, he finds out that Murakami has left. He decides to stay and investigate the suspicious circumstances. But he is not prepared to the assault of wild eroticism that the mansion's inhabitants will soon unleash on him...

Kuroneko-kan plays mostly like a visual novel, albeit with more choice prompts than it is usually the case in comparable games. The player is sometimes able to choose a location to visit; many other instances require him to choose the correct action and/or answer in order to view an additional scene, or avoid premature death.</desc>

		<name>Last Armageddon</name>
		<desc>The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.
Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens.</desc>

		<desc>In Lipstick Adventure, the player takes the role of Gorou, a young Japanese private detective. One day, a wealthy and powerful old man contacts him and asks him to find a box which - according to him - contained a family treasure. The young detective thinks that fortune has finally smiled to him, but when his pretty girlfriend Otomi disappears, he realizes that the mystery is bigger than he thought...

The game is a traditional Japanese adventure, with the usual first-person view and "Look - Talk - Think - Move" interface. There are no puzzles, and the game usually advances the plot when all the commands at a given screen are depleted, sometimes requiring to visit different locations several times.</desc>

		<desc>This is the second entry in  Lipstick Adventure series. Once again, the protagonist is the young private detective Gorou. One day his girlfriend Otomi introduces to him a customer, a man who calls himself Sakamoto. When Gorou meets him at the train station, Sakamoto hands him a suitcase, saying he should deliver it to his company in Osaka. However, the suitcase contains a bomb, and the poor Gorou is brought to police headquarters as a terrorist suspect...

Like the first game, Lipstick Adventure 2 is a detective/mystery Japanese-style adventure with comical and erotic elements. The player typically advances in the game by going through all the menu commands at a given screen. The commands are of a traditional "Look - Talk - Think - Move" variety, with sub-menus for object names.</desc>

		<desc>This entry in the  Lipstick Adventure series continues the story of the young private detective Gorou and his sweetheart Otomi. After attending a friend's marriage ceremony, they return to Gorou's office and find a strange package in the flowers. The package contains pictures of Otomi and several other girls, her schoolmates, some of them naked. Gorou heads to Otomi's high school to begin the investigation, without realizing that he will soon become involved in a sinister conspiracy...

Lipstick Adventure 3 plays similarly to its predecessors, having typical Japanese adventure gameplay with menu-based verb commands. The interface has been slightly tweaked, allowing easier "triggering" of events by eliminating some unnecessary commands.

Like the previous games in the series, Lipstick Adventure 3 walks a fine line between adult and non-adult games, having graphical nudity and plenty of sexual innuendo, but no explicit sex scenes.</desc>

		<desc>Love Phantom is a story about Akira Izayoi, a healer with supernatural powers, able to cure curses and demonic diseases, who also happens to be a big admirer of the opposite sex. This time, he finds out that the spirit of Lucretia, a French witch from 16th century, still exists, and must find and deal with it, aided by his pretty assistant and (also pretty) female witches, before an evil demonic organization beats him to it.

Love Phantom consists of a large amount of text accompanied by still pictures (mostly of sexual content). From time to time, the player is able to make a choice, which would change the following dialogue and unlock (or lock) CGs rather than alter the course of the story.</desc>

		<name>Lunatic Dawn</name>
		<desc>A long time ago, humans possessed unique power, that allowed them to create wonderful things and to build a highly advanced civilization. But it all ended when the chariots of the terrifying Death God attacked and destroyed the beautiful cities beyond the skies. Humans have lost their memories. And the magical powers from before started serving evil intentions...

Although a Japanese game,  Lunatic Dawn is much more similar to "old-school" Western RPGs than to its compatriots. For once, it is not a story-driven game. There are almost no scripted events, very few dialogues, etc. The overall theme of the game is quite abstract: the cities serve as places to buy equipment and learn combat techniques, but have no real locations (everything is accessed via a menu). 

The game is dedicated to character creation, RPG-style character development, and exploration. In the beginning, the player creates the playable character, choosing age, gender, and even weaknesses - all of which affect the character's parameters such as stamina, weapon technique, charisma, etc. Afterwards, the player allocates points into the remaining parameters. The player starts in a city and is absolutely free to go wherever he/she wants. There is a day/night cycle in the game. It is necessary to keep an eye on the character's stamina and buy food rations - the character can die of exhaustion and hunger. Random enemies appear on the world map and in dungeons. Battle screen is isometric and allows free movement. It is not necessary to choose a command for each turn: the battles evolve automatically until the player interrupts them with a new command.</desc>

		<name>Marginal Points</name>
		<desc>The Western kingdom of Endelunia is in grave danger. The forces of Darkness have invaded the country, threatening to conquer it completely and extinguish the power of Light. Princess Armantia appeals to the world's inhabitants to save the kingdom. Eventually, an unlikely hero joins forces with famous female warriors, and together they venture to drive the demonic invaders out of the country.

Marginal Points is a turn-based tactical game with rather simple mechanics. The player controls an army represented by several key characters, which act as unit leaders. The amount of soldiers in each unit is equivalent to individual character hit points. The player navigates the leaders through top-down environment, attacking enemies when they are in weapon range. The actual hostile encounter is displayed on a separate screen, and proceeds automatically. Extended cutscenes advance the story between battles. These scenes may feature dialogue options and even short one-screen point-and-click segments.</desc>

		<desc>Marine Buster is a turn-based strategy game that builds upon the rules of the popular board game BattleShip. The basic principle is the same as in BattleShip: players position ships on a board and then take turns attacking enemy ships by guessing their location on the opponent's board.

		<desc>A Japanese high-school student receives a letter from his sweetheart Mayumi, who has gone to study in a remote school as an exchange student. Something in the tone of the letter convinces the young man that Mayumi might be a trouble. He travels to her school, only to discover that Mayumi was kidnapped. Now it is up to him to investigate the school premises, talk to the personnel and other students, and rescue his beloved one.

Mayumi is a Japanese-style adventure. Interaction with the environment is performed by selecting verb commands that appear as icons surrounding the viewable area. These commands include the standard Look, Talk, Use, and Move, as well as the less common Hear and Hit. In some cases it is necessary to click on an object on the screen to interact with it after having selected a verb.</desc>

These commands include the standard Look, Talk, Use, and Move, as well as the less common Hear and Hit. In some cases it is necessary to click on an object on the screen to interact with it after having selected a verb.</desc>

		<desc>Merry Go Round is set in Yokohama, in year 2197. The city has turned into an international megalopolis, where crime prospers, and where justice is pursued by lone vigilante fighters. The hero of the story is a private detective named Brian. The first case is about an assault on a prostitute in the brothel "John Wayne". Further investigation reveals that the assault is connected to other cases, some of which involve dangerous biological experiments. With the help of the policewoman Akane, the bounty hunter Ridley, and others, Brian begins to gradually see the whole picture...

Merry Go Round consists mostly of still graphical images and plenty of text. The interaction is reduced to occasional choice-making. However, most of the choices don't influence the story, but simply lead to additional text description or picture. The game contains nudity and explicit sex scenes.</desc>

		<desc>Many years ago, in imperial Japan, advances in a mysterious science called "meta-topology" have led to the unexpected prosperity of the Heian era. A special university was founded by the scientists, where researches in bio- and nano-technology were conducted. Since women dominated society during that time, they were the ones imbued with the powers of meta-topology. A series of conflicts between reactionary governments and the "meta-women", as they began calling themselves, continued thousands years into the future. Led by Mayumi Tanaka, president of the astronomy department, a group of young women tries to protect their existence using their remarkable powers.

Metajo is a tactical role-playing game. The game consists of a series of large-scale battles, with cutscenes and dialogues advancing the story. The player controls a group of meta-women, navigating them over top-down battle area. The main characters are controlled by the players, while "nameless" units follow AI routines. Individual battles are displayed on separate screens, and are calculated according to the attributes of the participants. Leveling up occurs after having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points.</desc>

		<desc>Metal Eye 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe and is closely related story-wise to the  first game. In the future, people have built the floating city Zeron, where the best scientists work on creating androids, artificial human beings who look the same way as real ones. Harvest Corporation is the biggest company that creates androids. The hero of the game is a scientist named Wirg, the father of the first game's protagonist. His work is to train the androids after they have been created. One day, the company building is attacked, and Wirg has to escape. He is saved by a nun and brought into a small town in the middle of wasteland, where his adventure begins.

The game mostly follows a traditional Japanese RPG template: Wirg and his companions (a party of three) explore the top-down world and fight random enemies in turn-based combat in first-person view. The pictures of enemies appear super-imposed on whatever location the characters are currently in, without separate battle screens. The towns have isometric perspective. Like its predecessor, the game has a large world map that consists of many separate screens, often including dungeon-like locations.</desc>

		<desc>Metal Eye 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe and is closely related story-wise to the  first game. In the future, people have built the floating city Zeron, where the best scientists work on creating androids, artificial human beings who look the same way as real ones. Harvest Corporation is the biggest company that creates androids. The hero of the game is a scientist named Wirg, the father of the first game's protagonist. His work is to train the androids after they have been created. One day, the company building is attacked, and Wirg has to escape. He is saved by a nun and brought into a small town in the middle of wasteland, where his adventure begins.

The game mostly follows a traditional Japanese RPG template: Wirg and his companions (a party of three) explore the top-down world and fight random enemies in turn-based combat in first-person view. The pictures of enemies appear super-imposed on whatever location the characters are currently in, without separate battle screens. The towns have isometric perspective. Like its predecessor, the game has a large world map that consists of many separate screens, often including dungeon-like locations.</desc>

		<name>Cyberblock Metal Orange</name>
		<desc>Cyberblock Metal Orange is a ball-and-paddle game with adult content. Like Breakout/Arkanoid, the player must keep the ball from falling out the bottom of the screen, while at the same time attempting to break all destructible blocks on the screen.

Whenever you break certain blocks, colored capsules will pop out. Pick up the blue capsule to slow down the speed of the ball. Picking up the red capsules will increase your power meter by one increment. Depending on how full it is, you can choose from 7 different power-ups.

Some of these can be powered up by two or more levels, while others cannot be used together.

Each stage stars one of 5 girls: Tomo, Kazumi, Mika, Rinn and Cynthia. They will take off pieces of clothing as you play through more levels. A stage is cleared when the girl is completely naked.</desc>

		<name>Mirage</name>
		<desc>In the 19th century a young cavalryman gets raided. The robbers kidnap his girlfriend Jenny and now she is about to get sacrificed by a cult. Now the player has to rescue her and bring the culprit to justice. While searching the desert. Then he finds some odd balls, steps through a portal and has to activate so-called "mirages" which provide the back story of the game through live action videos or letters. 

To activate the mirages the player has to find clues in several scenarios. The goal of this scenarios is to find the exit, which is achieved by searching the stills after clickable objects and sometimes manipulate them with found objects. When clicking an object the game shows an FMV to show what happens. There are possible deaths and dead ends when choosing the wrong items on the screen. 

The scenarios are presented in high-definition stills and have the typical style of Western, including bordellos, saloons or gunmen.</desc>

The scenarios are presented in high-definition stills and have the typical style of Western, including bordellos, saloons or gunmen.</desc>

		<name>Mirage 2</name>
		<desc>The sequel to Mirage is set in the same world and features some recurrent characters, although the protagonist and the story are different. The main character is a young monster hunter named Etranze. He needs to slay a certain amount of monsters to reach a higher level, but meanwhile is struggling to be accepted among other heroes. This changes when he befriends Tree, Neat, and Lawn, the three lovely ladies who work (of all places) in the local church. Soon Etranze is summoned by queen Irene, who sends him on a quest to find a magical artifact that will save her kingdom from great peril.

Like its predecessor, Mirage 2 is a dungeon crawler. The dungeon exploration is done in 3D and is viewed from first-person perspective. Randomly appearing enemies must be defeated in turn-based combat. The player directly controls only Etranze in battle; his companion (the first one is Tree) is controlled by the AI, attacking or casting healing magic. 

Like the first game, Mirage 2 contains scenes with nudity, mild sexual situations, and pretty demonic female enemies who undress when defeated.</desc>

		<desc>The hero of the game is a seemingly ordinary man named Kaneda Momezo. But in fact he is not an ordinary man at all, but a superhero called "Mokkoriman", a name which is derived from the Japanese word for the "splash!" sound usually associated with sex. Young girls have been kidnapped and turned into seductive, but deadly monsters, who kill people with lethal attacks called SEX. It's time for the Mokkoriman to show his true face! With the help of his two superhero-aiding pretty girls, Mokkoriman is out for justice, revenge, and mutual SEX.

Mokkoriman RPG mostly plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG, with world map, random turn-based battles, party management, levels, equipment, and everything else, albeit with a definite comedic undertone: the enemies are naked girls, regular attacks are called "sex" (with choices of one-on-one or group), instead of magic there is "dirty talk", and health is restored by reading Japanese porn magazines. 

The game is very heavy on explicit sexual content; even during regular battles the attacks are animated in a very suggestive way. The game marks the beginning of Illusion's career as the maker of interactive sex scenes. The sexual encounters in Mokkoriman RPG have their own gameplay, which involves manipulating the mouse to simulate the movements of the player character during intimate moments. Some of the sex scenes are animated, making the game a RPG pioneer in this field.</desc>

		<desc>Moon Light Enegy (sic) is a Japanese-style adventure. The heroine of the game is a high school student named Maki, who is focused on just one thing: sex with girls. Most of the game is dedicated to seduction and sexual scenes between Maki and other young women. The interface includes the traditional commands Look, Talk, and Move, as well as context-specific commands grouped under "Action". Sometimes verb commands lead to a selection of objects to interact with. Interactive sex scenes feature detailed commands and special "pleasure bars" for Maki and her partner.</desc>

		<desc>A young man wakes up and sees a young woman in front of him. She tells him that her name is Crith, and she is the village nurse. The young man tells her that his name is Graffy, and... but that's all he can remember. Just his name, and the name of his cute strange pet animal - Lippen. Crith says that he was found unconscious outside of the village. Graffy is naturally eager to restore his memory, but there is more pressing business: it appears that the gods are angry at the villagers, and demand a human sacrifice, which has to be Crith. Graffy is determined to protect the girl, but there is only one way: to descend into the gods' temples and to find out why they are angry...

Mug-R is a first-person dungeon crawler, the gameplay focusing on exploring and mapping (with an automap) the maze-like temples. The party of playable characters - Graffy, Crith, and Lippen - fight randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. they gain experience points and level up in standard RPG fashion. Other RPG elements are somewhat reduced: there are no magic spells at all, and item usage is limited. The game contains explicit sexual scenes.</desc>

		<desc>The Necronomicon is a single player card game based on the works of HP Lovecraft where you battle against your opponent by attacking with cards, casting spells and summoning creatures. 

Each player is dealt 5 cards and take it in turns to play a card against the opponent, dealing damage, healing themselves, or 'tainting' the opponent and boosting your attack power and defense. After both players have used a card, a new card replaces each card that was played. Cards cost 'sanity' points to play, and if you spend all your sanity points you go insane and get affected by different types of phobias or other maladies that make it harder to win.

Both the player and the CPU go up ranks, and with each rank, extra life is awarded, and at certain times new cards are unlocked.

There is also a Challenge Mode, where you try to defeat the CPU in increasingly difficult situations such as having only 5 health to start with.

Scores are received after each battle, and a final score and other stats are displayed at the end of the 30 ranks of play.</desc>

Scores are received after each battle, and a final score and other stats are displayed at the end of the 30 ranks of play.</desc>

		<name>Satyr</name>
		<desc>The background story of Satyr is rather vague: the main character (default name Momojirou) is hired for two weeks to help a female gardener named Ayaka to grow flowers for celestial creatures - also female, young, and cute, though with elf-like ears and sometimes even wings. The goal here is to learn enough about different flowers, the ways to make them grow, and the preferences of the girls. 

The player is given exactly fourteen days of game time to accomplish this task. From the main screen it is possible to access information about flowers, check the weather conditions, talk to the girls (one time with each girl), then decide which flowers to plant. It is then possible to choose again with which girl to talk; sometimes they will ask different questions (about various topics, but mostly concerning flowers), and the answers will also influence their attitude towards the main character. Afterwards, a day of game time will pass. If the player is successful, the satisfied girls will pose naked, and eventually have sex with the hero.</desc>

		<name>School Girls</name>
		<desc>School Girls tells the story of Shinsuke, a young man looking for a teaching job. His uncle is the principal of a prestigious girls' high school, and he assigns to his nephew the job of a substitute art teacher. The rest of the plot is mostly dedicated to Shinsuke's relationships (sexual and otherwise) with the various female students and co-workers. The game allows no interaction besides choosing a location in the school to visit (office, gym, main gate, etc.). Going to specific locations triggers scenes that eventually advance the story. At certain points the player will also be prompted to make a choice regarding a context-specific action. Many of these choices, however, are purely cosmetic and do not affect the plot.</desc>

		<desc>Yusuke Nagase is an ordinary Japanese teenager who goes to high school. Lately, however, he has been experiencing something quite out of ordinary: he would see dreams and visions full of violence and rape scenes. Yusuke doesn't understand what is happening to him. The only grown-up he trusts is his uncle, who works as a teacher in the same school. Every step he makes leads to potential danger, and Yusuke must be very careful as he attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery and separate dream from reality.

Shizuku is a visual novel. The game consists of still images (usually with photorealistic backgrounds and anime-style character graphics) with text superimposed on them. The player's interaction is confined to scrolling through the text and occasionally helping Yusuke to make a choice. Depending on these choices, the game's story might go in a different direction, or end prematurely.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 1999, the Guild of Magicians was about to open a portal to the mysterious dimension of Nemesis, intending to rejuvenate Earth's polluted atmosphere. One of the magicians  used the portal for his own gain, releasing hostile creatures known as Lucifer Hawk onto Earth. 24 years later, a special unit was formed to combat the enemy.This episode involves the sighting of a strange ship in the clouds above Tokyo. Closer inspection reveals that the ship appears to be identical to the famous Titanic that sank  in 1912. The protagonist boards the ship along with Rally, Kiddy, Nami and other heroines from the manga in order to investigate this seemingly inexplicable phenomenon.The gameplay is done in Japanese-style, puzzle-less adventure format. The entire game is set on the Titanic. The player is generally free to visit various areas of the ship in any order, though access to certain locations is restricted and necessary events must be triggered in order to gain it.</desc>

		<name>Slayers</name>
		<desc>Slayers is based on an manga series of the same name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress). The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and fight the bad guys. In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and find out who or what has attacked her.

The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in Dragon Quest fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. There is no overworld character navigation; instead, the player selects locations on the map for instant travel. The game features anime-style cutscenes.</desc>

		<desc>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.

The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf .</desc>

		<name>Star Platinum</name>
		<desc>High in the heavens, there was a girl who was training in a shrine to be the successor of a goddess. One day, the goddess had to leave the shrine to attend a meeting of the many gods, leaving the girl alone at the shrine. The goddess warned her to leave alone a box of star-souls within the shrine, and that under no circumstances should she open it. Naturally, as soon as the goddess had left, the girl's curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box.

The star-souls escaped, turned the girl into a small fairy, and fled down towards the Earth. She must track down and capture the star-souls, now causing mischief on Earth, before the goddess returns to the shrine. However, while chasing several of the star-souls through the sky, the girl crashes through the window of a young man who lives on Earth. She decides that since he can somehow see her, that he's going to help her out, and so the two of them begin their adventure.

Star Platinum is an erotic visual novel combined with a basic card game. The player reads through the story as it progresses, accompanied by still illustrations of the events as they unfold. Whenever a character in need of exorcising is encountered, the game switches to the battle mode. In the battle mode, the player and the computer take turns matching and collecting cards that feature various astrological symbols. If one collects enough cards of a certain type to create a set, then the player can attack, reducing the opponent's health by a set amount and resetting the cards to their neutral state.

If the player can deplete the opponent's health, then the story will continue and the player will be rewarded with increasingly erotic images of the opponent (which can be viewed again later through the main menu). However, if the player's health is depleted, then the battle must be started over again from the beginning.</desc>

		<name>Star Platinum</name>
		<desc>High in the heavens, there was a girl who was training in a shrine to be the successor of a goddess. One day, the goddess had to leave the shrine to attend a meeting of the many gods, leaving the girl alone at the shrine. The goddess warned her to leave alone a box of star-souls within the shrine, and that under no circumstances should she open it. Naturally, as soon as the goddess had left, the girl's curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box.

The star-souls escaped, turned the girl into a small fairy, and fled down towards the Earth. She must track down and capture the star-souls, now causing mischief on Earth, before the goddess returns to the shrine. However, while chasing several of the star-souls through the sky, the girl crashes through the window of a young man who lives on Earth. She decides that since he can somehow see her, that he's going to help her out, and so the two of them begin their adventure.

Star Platinum is an erotic visual novel combined with a basic card game. The player reads through the story as it progresses, accompanied by still illustrations of the events as they unfold. Whenever a character in need of exorcising is encountered, the game switches to the battle mode. In the battle mode, the player and the computer take turns matching and collecting cards that feature various astrological symbols. If one collects enough cards of a certain type to create a set, then the player can attack, reducing the opponent's health by a set amount and resetting the cards to their neutral state.

If the player can deplete the opponent's health, then the story will continue and the player will be rewarded with increasingly erotic images of the opponent (which can be viewed again later through the main menu). However, if the player's health is depleted, then the battle must be started over again from the beginning.</desc>

		<name>Star Trap</name>
		<desc>Year is 2189, humanity has visited numerous galaxies due to the hyper-space engines. In search of adventure and exotics of the distant lands you have signed contract for 5 years with the Intergalactic Company to work on the Space Lines. For your first trip you were appointed as technician trainee on the freighter AMPELOS. The freighter left Achernar VI in direction of Tau Ceti II. Some hours later you were in the room of piloting when suddenly all alarms start... What is that? You have only 8 hours to discover it.

You start to explore the freighter AMPELOS. Robots became uncontrollable and attack you. They are surely behind the commander's death. Happily, the computer can help you to deactivate them. But your adventure is only beginning and already the cap of the dead commander (peace to his soul) reveal a number, which you remembers quickly.

The gameplay flows as the icon-based first-person adventure. You may move in available directions and do the actions via set of  icons, which are "Take", "Put", "Look at", "Examine", "Use", and some new such as "Listen", "Recharge" (a battery, a weapon). Another icon allows you to start a dialogue, for example, with the navigator or the doctor. You can then ask them simple questions from predefined words such as "HOW TO DEACTIVATE ROBOTS?" and you'll hear the words pronounced. At the right side of the screen you'll see the objects in your possessions and useful information: health, fatigue, your ammunition, your reservation of air (if you are wearing a combine suit). When you arrive in a place, you should use the icon to look at the place (the eye), sometimes several times to discover objects. Then (and before taking the object) you should use the magnifier on the object, because it can't be used on the object already put in inventory. 

Amstrad CPC version of the game is port of Atari ST version and use only 4 colours.</desc>

		<desc>Year is 2189, humanity has visited numerous galaxies due to the hyper-space engines. In search of adventure and exotics of the distant lands you have signed contract for 5 years with the Intergalactic Company to work on the Space Lines. For your first trip you were appointed as technician trainee on the freighter AMPELOS. The freighter left Achernar VI in direction of Tau Ceti II. Some hours later you were in the room of piloting when suddenly all alarms start... What is that? You have only 8 hours to discover it.

You start to explore the freighter AMPELOS. Robots became uncontrollable and attack you. They are surely behind the commander's death. Happily, the computer can help you to deactivate them. But your adventure is only beginning and already the cap of the dead commander (peace to his soul) reveal a number, which you remembers quickly.

The gameplay flows as the icon-based first-person adventure. You may move in available directions and do the actions via set of  icons, which are "Take", "Put", "Look at", "Examine", "Use", and some new such as "Listen", "Recharge" (a battery, a weapon). Another icon allows you to start a dialogue, for example, with the navigator or the doctor. You can then ask them simple questions from predefined words such as "HOW TO DEACTIVATE ROBOTS?" and you'll hear the words pronounced. At the right side of the screen you'll see the objects in your possessions and useful information: health, fatigue, your ammunition, your reservation of air (if you are wearing a combine suit). When you arrive in a place, you should use the icon to look at the place (the eye), sometimes several times to discover objects. Then (and before taking the object) you should use the magnifier on the object, because it can't be used on the object already put in inventory. 

Amstrad CPC version of the game is port of Atari ST version and use only 4 colours.</desc>

		<desc>Steam Heart's is a 2D sci-fi vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with erotic content. The game takes place in the far future, on an alien planet dominated by seven elf-like or catgirl princesses that have fallen under the spell of a unique virus that has driven them mad and threatens to destroy the planet if all the rulers declare all-out war.

Only Blondia Varady (nicknamed "Blow") and his sister Fallandia have been spared from the disease and must pilot their fighter ships in order to penetrate deep into the domain of each princess, destroy their war machines, and administer the antidote. Fortunately for Blow, the antidote has been synthesized into his reproductive organ, so that means there is only one way to inoculate the girls....

The player controls the fighter ship through vertically scrolling stages, trying to destroy every ship that crosses its path and reach the end boss. The ship has a primary weapon that can be constantly upgraded by collecting power-ups, and a secondary slot for all sorts of collectible weapons that can be picked up in mid-air. The game features 2P-cooperative gameplay and cutscenes made of still images that explain the plot and depict the protagonist's encounters with each princess.</desc>

		<desc>Arigawa is just an ordinary Japanese teenager, who attends an ordinary Japanese high school. At least he was ordinary until he met Mimi, the charming new exchange student. One day, being a perfect gentleman, Arigawa walked her home after the school, but was attacked by angry female martial artists. Mimi reveals to him that she has studied esoteric martial skills by a man known simply as "The Teacher". Unfortunately, not every one who knows these secret techniques uses them for the good. The young hero gets involved in a conflict from which there is no escape...

Super Battle Skin Panic is a hybrid of Japanese-style adventure and card-based battles. During the adventure part, the player clicks on one of the three available commands ("Look", "Talk", and "Move") to interact with the environment. As in most Japanese adventures, there is no puzzles or other kind of challenge, and at most screens the player simply has to deplete all the commands to proceed.

The battles are pre-set and follow a turn-based pattern. The player controls Mimi. Both player-controlled character and the enemy are dealt five cards, one of which the player has to "play"; after the turn is over, the player is dealt a new card. The cards work like battle command: attack, defense, etc. A special card is "undress", which, unsurprisingly, makes the character remove some of her clothes or even get completely naked. Both Mimi and the enemy have a "shame" meter, which can be reduced (or raised) by playing certain cards. The higher the shame meter, the more the character feels ashamed of her nudity, which leads to decrease in combat performance.</desc>

		<name>Super Battle Skin Panic</name>
		<desc>Arigawa is just an ordinary Japanese teenager, who attends an ordinary Japanese high school. At least he was ordinary until he met Mimi, the charming new exchange student. One day, being a perfect gentleman, Arigawa walked her home after the school, but was attacked by angry female martial artists. Mimi reveals to him that she has studied esoteric martial skills by a man known simply as "The Teacher". Unfortunately, not every one who knows these secret techniques uses them for the good. The young hero gets involved in a conflict from which there is no escape...

Super Battle Skin Panic is a hybrid of Japanese-style adventure and card-based battles. During the adventure part, the player clicks on one of the three available commands ("Look", "Talk", and "Move") to interact with the environment. As in most Japanese adventures, there is no puzzles or other kind of challenge, and at most screens the player simply has to deplete all the commands to proceed.

The battles are pre-set and follow a turn-based pattern. The player controls Mimi. Both player-controlled character and the enemy are dealt five cards, one of which the player has to "play"; after the turn is over, the player is dealt a new card. The cards work like battle command: attack, defense, etc. A special card is "undress", which, unsurprisingly, makes the character remove some of her clothes or even get completely naked.

		<name>Suzaku</name>
		<desc>Suzaku is the youngest in the tribe of warriors of the country of Oomi, which has a long tradition of martial arts and magical powers. The old teacher sees to that Suzaku is training with the best warriors of the country, and the young hero's first true assignment consists of retrieving a magical mirror from a nearby mountain cave. Little does Suzaku know that a series of events will occur that will require the warriors to seek help from other countries, and together defeat the evil that is threatening the land...

Suzaku is an RPG with predominantly Japanese-style elements (linear gameplay, party of characters that are essential to the story, simple leveling system, etc.). There are towns in which player-controlled party can rest and shop; however, most of the gameplay takes place in pseudo-3D, first-person maze-like dungeons (with an auto-map feature). There is no "world map" to navigate. Enemies appear randomly and have to be dispatched in simple turn-based combat, by using physical attacks or magic.</desc>

		<name>Sword Dancer</name>
		<desc>It is said that the country of Suzaku is protected by the spirit of the legendary White Dragon, a mythical benevolent being. A young maiden known as "dragon sorceress" always resides in the temple. Her protectors are young men which are called "sword dancers". One night, the current dragon sorceress, a girl named Setsuna, was attacked by a horrifying monster. Her sword dancer, Hien, tried to save her; but the monster was stronger and flew away with the girl. The young hero swears to bring her back, restoring his honor and the peace in his country.

Sword Dancer has top-down navigation, linear story progression, automatic leveling up, and randomly appearing enemies, which effectively makes it a Japanese-style RPG; however, unlike in most other games of the genre, the battles here aren't turn-based. Taking place on small side-scrolling areas, the battles switch to action gameplay, with the hero being able to jump, duck, and execute different kinds of attacks.

Various characters will join the party, but the player can only control one at a time. Any character can be chosen to be the lead of the party, and hence the active character in battles.</desc>

		<name>Sword Dancer</name>
		<desc>It is said that the country of Suzaku is protected by the spirit of the legendary White Dragon, a mythical benevolent being. A young maiden known as "dragon sorceress" always resides in the temple. Her protectors are young men which are called "sword dancers". One night, the current dragon sorceress, a girl named Setsuna, was attacked by a horrifying monster. Her sword dancer, Hien, tried to save her; but the monster was stronger and flew away with the girl. The young hero swears to bring her back, restoring his honor and the peace in his country.

Sword Dancer has top-down navigation, linear story progression, automatic leveling up, and randomly appearing enemies, which effectively makes it a Japanese-style RPG; however, unlike in most other games of the genre, the battles here aren't turn-based. Taking place on small side-scrolling areas, the battles switch to action gameplay, with the hero being able to jump, duck, and execute different kinds of attacks.

Various characters will join the party, but the player can only control one at a time. Any character can be chosen to be the lead of the party, and hence the active character in battles.</desc>

		<desc>Crazy Park is a place not recommended for people who want to have a peaceful existence, because the murderers, thieves and other thugs converted it in their home. But of course, as in every other story where some bad guys take a place which doesn't belong to them, there will appear a guy ready to end with them.

Trigger is a first-person view game where you have to make use of your Gun Stick accessory. The game has a side scroll by which you will see a multitude of enemies emerging. Some of them will shot at you, others will launch grenades, knives... there will even be exhibitionists. But don't go too fast, there will be other persons to which you should not shot at, otherwise points would be reduced from your marker. Also, there will also appear some objects that will recharge your ammunition.</desc>

		<name>True Love</name>
		<desc>As summer break rolls around, you, a college student, have decided to find the woman of your dreams! But, wait, who could it be? Maybe your childhood friend Mikae, athletic tomboy Chiemi, maybe even your teacher Miss Yumi? Who knows? But the only thing we do know is that now is your chance to find your true love!

True Love is a simulation of dating, with role-playing elements. You control a high school student looking for his true love. The goal of the game is to win the girls' hearts before your last summer of freedom is over. Every day when you wake up you plan your schedule for morning, afternoon and evening. Your choices (such as pleasure, sports, study, etc.) determine what special events will occur on that day (if any), and also raise your skills in the selected category. Different girls in the game (there are ten of them) have different interests, goals and preferences. If your skills in the category they find most important are high enough, you have a chance to get that girl into your bed.</desc>

Your choices (such as pleasure, sports, study, etc.) determine what special events will occur on that day (if any), and also raise your skills in the selected category. Different girls in the game (there are ten of them) have different interests, goals and preferences. If your skills in the category they find most important are high enough, you have a chance to get that girl into your bed.</desc>

		<desc>The protagonist of the game is assigned to supervise and lead a group known as Tuned Heart, which fights crime on city streets. The members of the group are all young and pretty girls, and also experts in firearms and vehicles. Mysterious mind-controlling criminals have appeared in America, and now cities are overrun by biker gangs and other criminals. It's time for the hero to assemble his group and show those criminals who is the boss!

Tuned Heart is a turn-based strategy game with strong RPG elements. Characters are moved around on vast top-down battle fields, attacking enemies with pistols and other weapons. Characters also receive experience points and gain levels, in a RPG fashion. Beside the usual weapon-related attributes, it is possible to customize the vehicles driven by the characters, and their strength can influence the outcome of battles.</desc>

		<name>Ultima 6 - The False Prophet</name>
		<desc>Several years after having restored Lord British to his rightful position as the monarch of Britannia, the Avatar is captured by demon-like creatures and placed on a sacrificial altar. His friends Iolo, Shamino and Dupre appear just in time to save him. In the Britannia castle, the Avatar learns that his abductors were gargoyles, a race of enigmatic creatures who have recently invaded Britannia and occupied the shrines of Virtue. As the Avatar embarks on a quest to liberate Britannia, he begins to gain insight into the gargoyles' true motives, and realizes that it is his duty to achieve peace and understanding between the two races.

Ultima VI is notable for having a fully continuous world. There is no "world map" in the game; all the locations are seamlessly connected to each other, turning the game world into an open environment. Compared to the previous installments in the series, the game focuses more on quests and exploration rather than on combat. The latter no longer involves separate screens; battles occur during exploration, without any transitions. The turn-based system from the previous games has been preserved.</desc>

		<name>Ultima Underworld - The Stygian Abyss</name>
		<desc>After having brought peace to Britannia during his previous journey there, the Avatar returns to our world. However, he is haunted by ghostly dreams that warn him of a great danger in Britannia. The Avatar decides to travel there once again. Upon his arrival, he witnesses the kidnapping of Baron Almric's daughter. Found guilty of the crime, the Avatar is thrown into the Great Stygian Abyss with the choice of either finding the girl or rotting in the dungeon. On his journey he will have to get along with the many inhabitants of the dungeon, who are survivors of a failed colony, and eventually find out that there's much more to this kidnapping than meets the eye.
Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss is commonly considered the first role-playing game with fluid first-person movement in a real 3D environment. Unlike earlier first-person RPGs such as Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder, the player can move in every direction and the graphics are updated continually. The player is also able to look up and down with the press of a key, jump, and swim. The dungeon is not made entirely of corridors and rooms arranged in a rectangular fashion, but has a lot of variety: slopes, stairs, bridges, underground rivers, and more.</desc>

Looks like the quiet family life they were hoping for will never become reality...

Ura Mansion Hakkin is an adventure game with very limited interaction, which mostly plays like  "choose-your-adventure" book. The protagonist is automatically taken to different locations and through the story; however, many scenes offer the possibility to make a choice, selecting a corresponding command from the menu. Some of these choices just involve choosing different ways of sexual intercourse, while others propel the story into a different direction. The game is very heavy on explicit sexual content, the majority of its scenes being depictions of sexual encounters the hero witnesses or participates in.</desc>

		<name>Vain Dream</name>
		<desc>The age of peace has come to an end...

For many years, the inhabitants of the country Ellzeria enjoyed a peaceful, prosperous life, protected by the goddess Ell. But the island nation of Seljild, led by demonic warlocks, began to conquer one Ellzerian city after another. To protect Duma, the heart of the land, the knight Tristram fought valiantly, but was heavily wounded in battle. Mel, a young female magician from Asrafil, has tended to his wounds, and after three months Tristram is healthy again, ready to enter a decisive battle against the forces of Seljild.

Vain Dream is a RPG with traditionally Japanese emphasis on story and characters, as well as simple game mechanics and mostly linear progression. However, combat is handled differently in this game than in most other Japanese RPGs, and similarly to  Emerald Dragon (made by the same company); still turn-based, it allows free movement on the battle field, calculating the amount of turns without displaying them, thus creating an illusion of real-time battles. Enemies usually appear in groups and are visibly walking on screen in hostile locations.</desc>

		<desc>The first game in the series largely ignored a major storyline in favor of focusing more on the fighting system and hentai sequences. Players take control of one of six V.G. waitresses and battle the other five in order to win the tournament. Kaori Yanase and Reimi Jahana serve as the game's sub and final boss characters respectively unless the player is controlling one of them, in which case Yuka takes the place of the player-controlled character.</desc>

		<name>Venus</name>
		<desc>Venus is a fairly simple dating simulation game. The player controls a man named Saeki who gets acquainted with four young women, three Japanese and one Western. Each girl has her own preferences as well as parameters that describe her feelings towards the protagonist. The goal is to raise these parameters (and ultimately the girls' "love level") by repeatedly going on dates. From time to time the player is required to make choices that would influence subsequent dating. There is an internal clock that is advanced every time the player character goes on a date. Successful dating results in explicit erotic scenes.</desc>

The goal is to raise these parameters (and ultimately the girls' "love level") by repeatedly going on dates. From time to time the player is required to make choices that would influence subsequent dating. There is an internal clock that is advanced every time the player character goes on a date. Successful dating results in explicit erotic scenes.</desc>

		<desc>The protagonist of the first game, Leopard Chateau-Lyon, finds himself wandering in a forest, having no memory of his own past, except his name. He is captured by two female warriors and is brought to their queen. It appears that there are only women in this country; when the hero says he is a man, the queen rejoices, telling him about an ancient legend that prophesied the advent of a creature named man, who will save their country from the ruthless queen of the neighboring land. The hero has to prove himself worthy of his heroic status and to defeat the enemy forces that threaten the country.</desc>

		<desc>God had created the world with Light and Shadow completing each other, maintaining the balance of events. The Tribe of Light are humans, living on the surface; the Tribe of Shadow has many different creatures, who dwell underground. To sustain peace and harmony between the tribes, a huge stone tablet called Words Worth was erected.nnBut one day, someone has shattered the tablet. Both Tribes blamed each other and began a bloody war that has been raging for hundred years. Finally, the king of the Shadow Tribe sends his son, the brave Astral, to find out what really happened to the tablets, and to restore peace in the world.nnWords Worth is primarily a first-person dungeon crawler. Even though there are a few "friendly" areas, such as a town where the hero can rest and buy supplies, most of the game is spent in dungeon-like, maze-like areas. There is no party in the game: Astral has to face the enemies alone. The enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based.</desc>

		<name>Words Worth</name>
		<desc>God had created the world with Light and Shadow completing each other, maintaining the balance of events. The Tribe of Light are humans, living on the surface; the Tribe of Shadow has many different creatures, who dwell underground. To sustain peace and harmony between the tribes, a huge stone tablet called Words Worth was erected.nnBut one day, someone has shattered the tablet. Both Tribes blamed each other and began a bloody war that has been raging for hundred years. Finally, the king of the Shadow Tribe sends his son, the brave Astral, to find out what really happened to the tablets, and to restore peace in the world.nnWords Worth is primarily a first-person dungeon crawler. Even though there are a few "friendly" areas, such as a town where the hero can rest and buy supplies, most of the game is spent in dungeon-like, maze-like areas. There is no party in the game: Astral has to face the enemies alone. The enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based.</desc>

		<desc>In X the player pilots a space tank sent to another planet to defend the earth from an alien invasion. There are ten missions with different objective ranging from restoring power to a power plant, to 'seek and destroy' missions. The player can guide the tank freely across the over world, but there are enemy patrols that will open fire. The alternative is going though underground tunnels, where there are spots to replenish the tank and its weapons. The player only has a limited amount of time for each mission, and shielding for the tank. If either runs out, the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>In X the player pilots a space tank sent to another planet to defend the earth from an alien invasion. There are ten missions with different objective ranging from restoring power to a power plant, to 'seek and destroy' missions. The player can guide the tank freely across the over world, but there are enemy patrols that will open fire. The alternative is going though underground tunnels, where there are spots to replenish the tank and its weapons. The player only has a limited amount of time for each mission, and shielding for the tank. If either runs out, the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>Three years have passed since the brave young warrior Latok Kart defeated the evil demon Badu, bringing peace to Xak, the world of humans. But one of Badu's servants, a sorcerer known as the Necromancer, has escaped. He plans to summon another dark being, known as the Gospel, from the demon world Zekisis to the world of Xak. Meanwhile, Latok and his companion, the fairy Pixie, are on the way to the village of Banuwa, hearing the rumor that Latok's long lost father has been seen nearby...

Rising of the Redmoon is the sequel to The Art of Visual Stage and the second entry in the Xak series. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor: Latok wanders through hostile areas, fighting enemies in action melee combat, gaining experience points and leveling up. A few options have been added, such as praying to Duel, a legendary god of war, to restore hit points.</desc>

		<name>Xenon - Mugen no Shitai</name>
		<desc>Kōji, a Japanese high school student, experiences strange, recurrent life-like dreams. He finds himself in a space station inhabited by beautiful young women. As he tries to explore the dream realm he wakes up. His teacher, intrigued by his account of the bizarre adventure, urges him to travel back to the space station in his dream and report his discoveries to her. Eventually Kōji realizes that his dream and reality are tightly connected, and finds himself compelled to avert a grave danger.

Xenon is an erotic sci-fi visual novel. The player takes control of Kōji by occasionally making decisions, most involving choosing a location to travel to. The entire game is confined to the space station of Kōji's dream and the high school building of reality. Depending on the player's decisions the story may branch into different directions, creating alternate versions of Kōji's dream.</desc>

		<name>Xenon - Mugen no Shitai</name>
		<desc>Kōji, a Japanese high school student, experiences strange, recurrent life-like dreams. He finds himself in a space station inhabited by beautiful young women. As he tries to explore the dream realm he wakes up. His teacher, intrigued by his account of the bizarre adventure, urges him to travel back to the space station in his dream and report his discoveries to her. Eventually Kōji realizes that his dream and reality are tightly connected, and finds himself compelled to avert a grave danger.

Xenon is an erotic sci-fi visual novel. The player takes control of Kōji by occasionally making decisions, most involving choosing a location to travel to. The entire game is confined to the space station of Kōji's dream and the high school building of reality. Depending on the player's decisions the story may branch into different directions, creating alternate versions of Kōji's dream.</desc>

		<desc>Adol Christin's long-time friend, Dogi, wishes to return to his home town of Redmont after hearing about strange disturbances that are happening there. Always looking for an adventure, Adol joins him and soon finds out the cause of this new evil.
Ys III: Wanderers from Ys breaks away from the "bumping into enemies" battle system of the first two games, allowing Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions. Beside changing the battle system, the game's perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has the ability to jump now. New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up abilities such as healing and shielding. The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.</desc>

		<desc>Princess Maker is the first of Gainax' "princess-raising simulation" game series.

You are a noble warrior who has just saved your kingdom from an invasion by the terrible Demon Lord. The grateful king offers you to choose any reward you wish for your brave deed. But instead of opting for half of the kingdom or the riches of the land, you ask the king for the permission to raise a poor little orphan girl named Maria. 

And so the game begins. You are the one who has to build Maria's future. Of course, you can do it in many ways. You can strive to make a real princess out of her, teach her good manners, study arts, to make her a brave fighter like yourself, or just a lazy bimbo who cares for nothing. Her destiny is in your hands!</desc>

		<name>Alone In The Dark</name>
		<desc>Jeremy Hartwood has committed suicide in his Louisiana mansion, Derceto. You take the role of either Edward Carnby, a private investigator, or Emily Hartwood, Jeremy's niece, and investigate the suspicious death. The three-floor mansion is reputed to be haunted by its eccentric past owner. Very quickly, you realise that it is. Warped rats, zombies and giant worms are among the foes who are after you, and you must somehow escape.

Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models.</desc>

		<desc>In Alone in the Dark 2, you play as Detective Edward Carnby. Carnby must now investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack who has allegedly kidnapped young Grace Saunders. His partner Ted Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated Hell's Kitchen mansion and rescue the girl, only to disappear.
Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are actually 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack allied himself with Elizabeth Jarret, a voodoo witch. However, the dark magic that allows them to remain immortal forces Jack and his crew to make regular human sacrifices.
Carnby must now fight his way through Hell's Kitchen to find a way to break the spell.
The game's graphics are a 2D-3D hybrid. You must solve numerous puzzles while fighting zombie pirates with your weapons or by trickery.</desc>

		<desc>Something has wrecked the Hakurei Shrine, and the resident Shrine Maiden isn't going to take it lying down. She charges through the gateway into another world, intent on locating and punishing the one responsible for the act. Although she isn't capable of harming her enemies directly, she wields an incredible weapon: the Hakurei Yin-Yang Orb. With it Reimu will be able to cut a bloody swath through all who stand before her... assuming that she can manage to control it!</desc>

		<name>Arcus III</name>
		<desc>Twelve years have passed since the half-elf Pikto and his friends have defeated the evil demon and restored peace in the world of Arcusas. But evil raises its ugly head one more time. The capital city is attacked, the soldiers are massacred... Is the powerful sorcerer Vido to blame? But Pikto knows that in order to preserve peace in the land, different races - elves, dwarves, humans - have to unite. He must find faithful companions, venture to dangerous places. and save the world once again!

Arcus III returns to the traditional gameplay concept of the first game: the entire game plays from first-person view; pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons are home to randomly appearing enemies, which must be defeated in turn-based combat. Pikto and his companions can also learn a variety of magic spells.</desc>
