		<path>./No-Intro/Arkanoid DS (USA) (Demo).nds</path>
		<name>Arkanoid Ds</name>
		<desc>The latest version of Taito's classic game: Arkanoid.
It features the classic gameplay of the previous games, the player controls the Spaceship VAUS (a moving platform at the base of the lower screen) and its energy ball to destroy the color block (in the upper screen) through each levels.
As usual, there are various power-ups to help through the game (laser, slow ball, duplicate balls, next level, etc.)

The game has one player mode, multiplayer and vs COM modes.

The one player mode consists of the Clear mode and the Quest mode.

The Clear mode is a series of 7 zones of 5 rounds each. There is a total of 28 zones in the game. At the end of the Clear modes, Ananke (the main character and pilot of the VAUS) frees one of his captured friends, these friend's VAUS can then be used in the game.

In the Quest mode, each previously played round is available to replay with a specific challenge (Break all blocks of one color within time limit, or ball launch limit, etc.) Each round gives points that can be used at the shop to buy in-game features to customize it (Blocks shapes, VAUS, backgrounds, etc.)

The VS Com and Multiplayer are similar. You must defeat either the Com or another friend in either Bust All or Bust Color match. The quickest to achieve the goal wins. There is also new power-ups that hinder the opponent.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Cake Mania (USA, Europe) (Demo).nds</path>
		<name>Cake Mania</name>
		<desc>Jill is a young baker who acquired her passion for baking from her grandparents in their bakery, Evans Bakery.  When she returned from culinary school, she discovered Evans Bakery closed down because a "Mega-Mart" moved in.  Jill decides to show the mega corporation what her family's baking is all about and opened her own bakery in order to earn enough money to buy back Evans Bakery. Can Jill handle the pressure of running her own business and beat Mega-Mart?

In Cake Mania, your job is to help Jill meet the monthly quota through 48 progressively difficult levels. This is no simple task because you will have to bake quickly as well as serve the customers quickly.  

There are a variety of different customers to serve.  From nice old ladies to impatient holiday icons like Cupid! Each kind of customer have a different patience-level (indicated by the number of hearts).  The longer they wait, the lower their patience.  If they get too low, they will storm off and cost you money!

When a customer first enters your bakery, hand them a menu. Then they will give you their order (in the form of a thought bubble) and you will have to create that cake.  If you create the wrong cake (wrong shape or wrong frosting, etc) then you will have to throw it away and start over (costing you more money). You start off with one oven and one frosting machine.  Between levels you will have the opportunity to purchase upgrades or new items that will improve the bakery's.  For example, you can purchase upgrade your oven to one that bakes faster or you can purchase a T.V. that will help improve customers' patience.</desc>

		<desc>Set in the early 19th century, this installment of the long running Castlevania series takes a slight departure from the typical series storyline. A secret monastic organization, Order of Ecclesia, is charged with finding alternative ways of combating the hordes of undead summoned by the ever-returning evil lord Dracula, as the Belmont clan has apparently gone into hiding. Shanoa, a young acolyte of the Order, is chosen for her extraordinary magical abilities to wield Dominus: the ultimate spell against evil. As she is about to complete the ritual to absorb Dominus a rogue acolyte named Albus steals the three tomes containing the spell. Shanoa is then dispatched to track down Albus and return him and the spell back to the Order.</desc>

This installment of the long-running series adds dual screen gameplay, enabling the player a wider view, and a 2-player co-op mode via local Wi-Fi connection. Each player is now given two weapon slots which can be filled with any one of the game's many weapon power-ups and switched at will with a press of a shoulder button. The game features nine levels set in such classic Contra locations as Jungle, Waterfall and a pseudo-3D Base.
As a bonus, the cartridge contains an illustrated history of Contra, as well as the Contra and Super C original NES games.</desc>

		<desc>The fifth game in the Custom Robo series, Custom Robo Arena moves the action into the portable realm again with the first entry on the DS. It is the first in the series to be released in PAL territories, and the second in North America.

The story has the player's character joining the Robo Team 'Numero Uno' and the story unfolds as they attempt to win the Robo Cup. Like all the Custom Robo games, except the GBA incarnation, the battles are conducted in 3D, with the player attempting to defeat their opponent, in a Pokémon fashion similar to the previous games. The touch screen is used to clean off the player's Robo after it becomes dirty, as this reduces its efficiency.

In another first it offers 2 player multiplayer over Nintendo Wi-Fi and allows voice chat and utilises the rivals system seen in Metroid Prime: Hunters.</desc>

Diddy Kong Racing DS is remake of the Nintendo 64 game of the same name.  However, while the story and setting remains the same, this is more of an upgrade instead of a port.  Players can still race around assorted tracks around Tiger Island via kart, hovercraft or plane, winning races to earn golden balloons to progress and defeating bosses to confront Wizpig.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy IV</name>
		<desc>Final Fantasy IV is a remake of the classic Japanese RPG that was first released for SNES, known as  Final Fantasy II in the West. 

Unlike the many subsequent ports (to Playstation, GameBoy Advance, etc.), this release is a full remake, programmed from scratch with real-time 3D graphics. The characters have a "super-deformed" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.

It also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called "augments", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc. 

Beside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the "naming" moogle of the original game, etc.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure (USA) (Rev 1) (Video).nds</path>
		<name>Henry Hatsworth In The Puzzling Adventure</name>
		<desc>Poppycock!  When the number one pompous adventurer, Henry Hatsworth, discovers a golden hat deep in the jungle, it makes him twenty years younger - but it also unleashes another world, releasing hordes of nasty monsters!  To top it off, the number two pompous adventurer, Weaselby, is one step ahead of Hatsworth - eager to snag up the remaining pieces of the Golden Suit and claim the number one position in the Pompous Adventurer's Club for himself!  Who can grab the suit, put Weaselby in his place, and seal up the other world, all before Tea Time?  Why, Henry Hatsworth, of course!

Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure is a hybrid of two styles of game - the top screen has an action-platformer starring Hatsworth, who must defeat enemies with his sword.  When he does, they fall down into the Puzzle Realm on the Touch Screen, which plays like Tetris Attack.  Players must match the block enemies up with other colored blocks to finally destroy them, before they rise up back to the top screen to harass Hatsworth once again.

Henry also has access to a super meter - by clearing blocks in the Puzzle Realm, he fills it up.  If he fills it up enough, it's Tea Time!  This means that Hatsworth can transform into superpowered steampunk robot that shoots lasers and missiles and is completely invulnerable, which is handy when the player is in a jam.</desc>

		<name>Iron Man</name>
		<desc>Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven different platforms. The NDS version, by A2M, is the most different one.

The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them back.

The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through 8 different missions, divided in by air and by foot missions, and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through images between every mission, which use the voices of the actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard.

As for the game mechanics, by foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red and gold suit later, using range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles, micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful "Unibeam". Both the weapons and the suit (propulsion and armor systems) are upgradeable using the points that each mission regards you.

In the handling section, the next approach is used: move with a given set of controls, aim with another. In addition, there is also a button for repulsors (extra propulsion) to fly faster. The NDS touchscreen is used for aiming 360-wise, touching in a given direction from the center of the screen, and the pad is used for moving.</desc>

		<desc>Players of all ages are encouraged to aide Ivy on her journey, utilizing the Wii Remote or Nintendo DS stylus to create the stretchy and flexible vines that propel Ivy forward, over and through obstacles before her. Players encounter crows, rats, raindrops and more, all of which aim to hinder Ivy's progress. But every story's hero finds a way, and Ivy soon finds an ally in the unlikeliest of places-the strange vines that erupt forth to guide, protect and propel her on her way. As skill improves, players must more carefully and quickly manipulate the trusty vines in new ways and utilize the game's distinct mode of transport.</desc>

		<name>Jam Sessions</name>
		<desc>Jam Sessions is a reworked and localized version of the Japan-only DS title Hiite Utaeru DS Guitar M-06. It is a rhythm/music game, but rather than only offering musical challenges like other games in the genre, it can also be used as a tool - a pocket guitar. Simulating a guitar, the game part allows players to go through a list of famous songs. The chords are selected on the D-pad while the stylus is used to simulate strumming on the screen. Alternately, the L-button can be used to strum. The details are worked out thoroughly - speed and power change the sound, and downstrokes sound different from upstrokes. With only one strum string shown, only chord progression can be performed and no individual riffing or picking. The game does not punish players for not doing well, songs just keep on going regardless of the player's performance. There is a tutorial and warm up mode to get familiar with the controls.

As a tool, it allows players to compose their own songs and add a variety of effects. These include distortion, low cut, high cut, delay, chorus and flanger with extensive settings for each of them. These can be set invariably or made touch-specific. When using headphones or external speakers, the DS microphone can be used to sing along. Additionally, the DS can be plugged in to an amplifier via the headphone jack to output a more natural sound. A US re-release include a mini-amp in the package. Instead of using a stylus, pick-shaped variants were also made available.

In the top screen, players can add a metronome, guide bars and tab guides, along with different backgrounds and templates. Up to five different compositions can be saved.</desc>

A series of seemingly unrelated deaths are taking place in San Francisco. Some look like suicide or robbery, but something doesn't add up. Players are part of the Women's Murder Club and take on the role of Lindsay, Cindy or Claire using their respective skills for the task at hand. Lindsay, the police officer, investigates the crime scene, first by clearing up the "mess" and then by looking for clues as indicated, such as items that may have belonged to the victim or the murder weapons. Claire, the medical examiner, finds out the cause of death and anything that can be deduced from the body. There are no penalties for choosing the wrong object and there is no time limit.</desc>

		<desc>In this game based on the 2008 DreamWorks movie of the same name, the player is Po the panda. Po finds out that the best kung fu masters have been captured by the evil Tai Lung. Po is fat, loves to eat dumplings, and is pretty slow and clumsy at kung fu, so he is shocked when he is asked to go rescue them. Although some elements have been changed, the game's theme is largely identical to the movie and linear in design.

Po's journey consists of finding the five kung fu masters, mastering a new skill that they teach him, then continuing on to find Tai Lung. This game is a 3rd-person side-scroller with frequent use of the touch screen and seems largely based on the mechanics and engine employed in the DS version of Spider-Man 3.

Po's movements are controlled through the D-pad while attacks are performed by swiping the styles on the touch screen. These are also used to throw objects and perform the learned special moves. Most of the gameplay consists of hand to hand combat with enemies, and traversing levels by consulting your top screen mini-map. New moves are learned gradually and there are also small puzzle elements where Po needs to interact with the environment to progress.</desc>

		<desc>Ride into adventure with Link and Princess Zelda.

? Wield weapons and solve puzzles, all with your stylus

? Duke it out with friends in multiplayer battle mode

? Link and Zelda adventure together for the first time

The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks sets hero Link on a daring new adventure. The game provides players with a new story, more puzzles and even a new mode of transportation. In this game, Link voyages by train, which offers up new possibilities for problem-solving. The game has the same look and feel established in the hit Nintendo DS game The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass.

? Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he?s accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touchscreen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm.

? When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks.

? Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system.

? As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.</desc>

		<name>Lunar Knights</name>
		<desc>Many years into the future, a race of vampires have emerged, plunging planet Earth into darkness with an environmental control system called the 'paraSOL'.  They now control the planet, with humans living in fear.  When all hope seems lost, two boys with amazing power emerge to save the planet.  The Dark Swordsman, Lucian, and a rookie member of the vampire fighting 'Guild', Aaron.

Lunar Knights is an indirect sequel to the Boktai series of games, which takes place many years after.  Its focus is much more on action as opposed to stealth, although some stealth elements from the earlier games remain (for example, you can blow into the microphone to whistle and attract the attention of enemies).  Players control the two characters, Lucian and Aaron.  Lucian fights with a huge sword called 'Vanagand'.  As a result, Lucian has a close combat style.  Lucian uses the power of moonlight to fuel his special attacks and moves.

The other character is Aaron, a gunslinger for the Guild.  He fights by using sunlight to charge up his gun, the Knight, and shoot ranged shots at foes.  Aaron's special attacks and moves use up sunlight.  Both Aaron and Lucian can use junk materials to increase the level of their weaponry, giving them more power.

The main goal of the game is to make your way through the dungeons and purify the vampire at the end.  The dungeons themselves are fairly standard - you search for treasure chests, avoid traps and solve puzzles.  At the end, you'll fight a boss vampire, and once you've defeated them, the Casket Rocket will be called.  Because the vampires have blocked out the sun on Earth, you'll need to take the vampire into space to purify them.

At this point, the game becomes a touch screen controlled shooter.  To control the ship itself, you drag it around the screen with the stylus.  To shoot enemy ships, you tap them with the screen.  Once you reach the end, the vampire will be purified by the magnified power of the sun.</desc>

		<name>Madagascar Kartz</name>
		<desc>Madagascar Kartz is a racing game based on DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar. It was released on October 27, 2009 and the second game on Madagascar's spin-off series.

Gameplay[edit]
The game is a basic kart racing game, and the player can perform jumps, flips, rolls.[1] There are many different stages from scenes of the franchise.[1] Playable characters include Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, King Julien, Mason and Phil, or all four of the penguins.[1] The Madagascar Kartz Wheel is bundled with the Wii version of the game. This wheel is optional. This wheel's look is different from that of the Wii Wheel from Mario Kart Wii.[1]

Playable characters include Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, Gloria the Hippotamus, The Penguins, The Chimps, and King Julien from the Madagascar. Two characters from other movies are included alongside the Madagascar, Shrek from Shrek, and B.O.B. from Monsters vs. Aliens, all DreamWorks Animation franchises. Race types include Quick Race, Championship, Time Trial and Checkpoint race. A Championship race is one where the player collects mangoes and tries to finish first place in order to unlock higher speed classes (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 200cc, the last one is raced in reverse direction/mirror mode), more karts and tracks. In Time Trial, players beat their own times and earn medals (gold, silver and bronze). In Checkpoint Race, players collect as many hourglasses as they can before the time runs out. There are several tracks in the game. Also, in a track, most tracks have 2 shortcuts. "I Like to Move It", sung by Reel 2 Real, is the menu theme. The game's gameplay is similar to those of Mario Kart Wii, by Nintendo. The sequel is Super Star Kartz.</desc>

		<name>Magnetica</name>
		<desc>Playing with balls is fun! Magnetica is a fiendish action puzzler game from Japanese developer Mitchell Corporation, and the sequel to the 1998 arcade game Puzz Loop. Marbles will relentlessly roll across twisted tracks and into a hole in its center. When three same-coloured marbles touch each other, they destroy themselves. With the DS Stylus, players must shoot same-coloured marbles into the oncoming rows in order to prevent them from falling down the hole and thus clear a track. The twist is that now, marbles that share the same color will attract each other!

Magnetica takes advantage of the Nintendo DS hardware for precise touch-screen functionality and brings a new play mechanic to the famous puzzle. Test your ball-shooting skills in Challenge Mode, Puzzle Mode, Quest Mode and more.</desc>

		<name>Mario &amp; Luigi : Bowser's Inside Story</name>
		<desc>Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story is the third game in the Mario &amp; Luigi series of games. Players control Mario and Luigi simultaneously in the side-scrolling platform environment of Bowser's body, while also controlling the Koopa King himself in the top-down world of the Mushroom Kingdom. Similar to games like Earthbound, enemy encounters are seen as actual enemies that players can avoid or attempt to strike early. The actual battles are a combination of turn-based menu attacks, and timed reactions to enemies during battle. By watching the way an enemy reacts, you can anticipate their attack and avoid it or counterattack.</desc>

The mini-heroes have to find the crystals before he does, making their way through giant environments filled with enormous creatures. The single-player campaign takes place in five different settings, each of them ending with a boss. As usual, players have to collect coins and stars, at the same time escaping dangers such as Piranha Plants and other classic creatures from the Mario universe.</desc>

All the puzzles are fairly small and take up anywhere from one screen to four screens (2x2) in size. All the Mini-Marios that are collected in each room are then used in the Donkey Kong boss battle at the end of the world. All of the control is done with the stylus; no buttons are used at all.</desc>

		<name>Meteos</name>
		<desc>Designed by Masahiro Sakurai and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Meteos was the DS's second big-name puzzle game (after Polarium).  

Most of the game's action takes place on the bottom of the DS's two screens, where colored meteors plummet downwards towards a planet's atmosphere.  There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button.  When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they "ignite" and rocket up towards the top screen.  Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once.  The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into "orbit" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors.  Meteos features many different "planets" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Over the Hedge</name>
		<desc>A portable adventure game based on the animated movie of the same name and which chronicled the adventures of a group of animals in their struggle against a recently-built housing development.

Playing as either RJ, Hammy or Verne you'll have to complete several incursions into the human dwellings to steal food, supplies and sabotage further housing developments.

Gameplay-wise the game is a 3rd-person perspective stealth-adventure hybrid in which you must navigate through several houses looking to retrieve your current objective while avoiding the many traps set by the homeowners (as well as the homeowners themselves). To get by you can make use of several unique items that allow you to set up diversions, or create them yourself by blowing into the microphone. Each character has individual strengths and weaknesses and in many missions you'll have to alternate between each character to successfully complete the level. 

As a unique feature the game displays the standard 3rd person perspective on the top screen while the lower screen features a top-down view which allows you to better scan the levels for traps and items, both rendered with fully polygonal graphics.

Features a single player campaign and a wireless multiplayer mode with a two-player mode in which two players compete to clear out a level of food.</desc>

They talk and team up with other Pokemon to set out on an epic voyage while navigating an endless array of randomly generated dungeons.</desc>

		<name>Pokemon Ranger - Guardian Signs</name>
		<desc>In the region of Oblivia, a gang of thieves known as the "Pokémon Pinchers" are stealing wild Pokémon and planning to use them for their own nefarious purposes.  Two Pokémon Rangers, Summer and Ben, are sent to investigate.  However, after an encounter with the Pinchers, one of them is kidnapped while the other is left stranded on an island.  There they meet a Pichu with a ukulele, who teams up with them to help rescue its Pichu friends who have also been captured by then Pinchers.  Can you rescue your partner, and save the Pokémon of the Oblivia region?

Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs is the third in the Pokémon Ranger series.  As with the previous games, you move your character around using a device known as the stylus, as well as battling with a device called the "capture styler" (represented by the stylus).  To battle, you encounter a Pokémon on the touch screen, and your aim is to repeatedly draw connecting loops around it until you deplete its health to zero, allowing it to join your team.  Pokémon can be used in the environment to clear obstacles and help you progress (such as such as cutting trees, extinguishing fires and so on), or by assisting you in battle and helping you weaken enemy Pokémon.  Near the start of the game, Ukulele Pichu becomes a part of your team and randomly appears during battles to assist.  If you tap it when it appears, it will jump into battle and play its ukulele, which scatters musical notes around the screen which weaken enemies.

A little bit further into the game, you also gain the help of the Legendary Pokémon dogs, Raikou, Entei and Suicune, first introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver.  These Pokémon have special abilities that allow you to reach places that you normally couldn't (for example, Raikou can leap across large gaps).  To summon these Pokémon, you must draw a special sign with the stylus that represents them, but these can only be drawn outside where the sky can be seen.

After a key point in the game, you also unlock the ability to travel back in time with Celebi, which gives you access to wireless multiplayer Pokémon Ranger missions.  These missions can be played with up to four players, and Rangers can team up to help capture Pokémon more quickly.  This is a great help as each mission must be completed within a certain time for it to be a success.  Most wireless missions can also be played solo, but are more difficult this way.  You can also earn experience which can be used to increase your capture styler's power, health and speed.</desc>

		<name>Polarium</name>
		<desc>This is a puzzle game similar to Tetris in that blocks fall from above, and to clear the lines before the screen fills up, you must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white).  To change the color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select it with the stylus, then tap it again to make the block flip.  You can also drag the stylus along the screen to change the polarity if many block at the same time.

There is also a puzzle mode where time isn't as critical.  Blocks aren't falling, but are just in a certain pattern on the screen.  The object is to make the polarity of every block in each horizontal line the same.  But the trick is to do the entire screen with one swipe of the stylus.  There are 100 puzzles in this mode and they can get very difficult.

The most addicting part of this game is the multiplayer.  Utilizing the DS's two screens, you can see your blocks and your opponent's blocks.  As you create a horizontal line all of the same polarity, that line is then scrambled and sent to your adversary.  The object is to clear your screen before your opponent does.  The multiplayer mode does not require 2 Game Cards to play.  In fact, when the game is sent over to another DS through the IPL, they don't even need to play multiplayer.  The person that received the game can play a simple demo of the game by themselves.</desc>

		<name>Professor Layton and the Curious Village</name>
		<desc>After hearing about a strange inheritance dispute in the town of St. Mystere, Professor Layton and his young apprentice, Luke, travel there on behalf of Lady Dahlia, who has requested their presence to resolve the issue.  However, it quickly becomes apparent that St. Mystere is quite strange... all the townsfolk seem to be obsessed with puzzles, and Baron Reinhold's fortune isn't the only secret that the town has hidden...

Professor Layton and the Curious Village is a puzzle game which uses the works of Akira Tago, author of the Japanese series of Head Gymnastics books as its basis.  As both Layton and Luke, players explore the town of St. Mystere screen by screen.  Each screen contains puzzles, either hidden in the scenery or by talking to characters.  Upon finding a puzzle, the screen changes and the player is presented with the puzzle itself: the description of the puzzle on the top screen, and the puzzle (as well as the place to input the answer) on the bottom screen.  Some puzzles require simple calculation, some have a trick answer, while others are riddles.  The selection of puzzles is quite varied.  If the player gets stuck, they can purchase a hint with 'Hint Coins'.  However, these are limited - more can be found hidden in the game world, but there a set number of coins in the entire game.

Professor Layton has a visual style similar to that of a watercolor painting.  While most of the game does not have much animation, key story sequences are told in fully animated and voice acted scenes.  The game also used Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to connect to the Internet and download additional puzzles for players to solve.</desc>

		<desc>When Professor Layton and his assistant, Luke, receive a letter from the Professor's mentor, Dr. Andrew Schrader, Layton feels uneasy.  The letter mentions that Schrader has acquired an elusive artifact called the Elysian Box - legend has it that anyone who tries to open it dies.  The pair rush to Schrader's apartment, but it is too late - the box appears to have claimed another victim, and yet is missing.  The only clue is a ticket for the luxurious Molentary Express, found in the apartment.  Will Layton and Luke be able to solve this latest mystery?

Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box is the sequel to Professor Layton and the Curious Village, taking place directly after the events of the first game.  Players take the role of the titular professor and his assistant Luke as they explore the Molentary Express for clues to the mystery of the Elysian Box.  By talking to people and examining the environment, players discover puzzles, which when solved progress the story further.

As with the first game, puzzle can range from logic problems, to riddles, to simple calculation.  If stuck, players can spend 'Hint Coins' that they can find throughout the game - but there are a finite amount available, so they should only be used when needed.</desc>

		<name>Professor Layton and the Unwound Future</name>
		<desc>Professor Layton and his assistant Luke attend the unveiling of a new invention called a time machine.  The Prime Minister of London is volunteered as a test subject, but the machine explodes and there is no trace of him.  With the Prime Minister missing, London is in chaos!  Shortly after these events, the puzzle-solving pair receive a letter, which has apparently been sent by Luke's future self, stating that London is in serious trouble.  The Professor and Luke follow the directions in the letter, which leads them to their most exciting adventure yet...

Professor Layton and the Unwound Future is the third installment in the Professor Layton series. As with the previous games in the series, players explore game scenes by tapping on areas of interest with the stylus.  Doing so can cause Layton and Luke to examine objects, talk to characters, finding hint coins (which can be spent on hints for difficult puzzles) and most importantly, discover puzzles that can be solved.  Puzzles range from math, to logic, to riddles to sliding block puzzles, as well as many more different types.  There are also "secret" areas in scenes which, when tapped, may leave a puff of dust or a rustle of leaves.  Repeatedly tapping on these areas reveals a hidden secret, such as a bonus hint coin, or even a hidden, more difficult puzzle.

New to Unwound Future is the addition of the 'Super Hint'.  While as with the previous games, you can spend a hint coin to unlock up to three hints, there is also another option.  Once these three hints have been exhausted, for the price of two hint coins, you can unlock a more detailed 'Super Hint' as a last resort.  There are also three new minigames incorporated into the game.  In the Picture Book game, you must place the correct stickers in the right spots to make a story that makes sense.  In the Toy Car game, you must place tiles which navigate a toy car around the board, collect all the objects, and then reach the goal.  Finally, in the Parrot game, you must tie ropes onto pegs to help your parrot deliver parcels to people who have requested them.</desc>

They have established their base at a shopping mall and begun training for their nastiest scheme yet. As part of this training, the Rabbids must carry out several missions around the globe to help them in an attempt to dominate the world. The Rabbids will also try to study human behavior by mimicking everything we do... but in the Rabbid sort of way, with no logic... of course.</desc>

		<name>Rhythm Paradise</name>
		<desc>Get ready to feel the rhythm!  Rhythm Heaven is a game based entirely around musical rhythm and timing.  The game is a collection of games based around a song, where the player must perform actions in time to the music to successfully complete the game.  All games are based around the simple motions of tapping, sliding and flicking the stylus.

As each game varies from each other, at the start of each game, you're given a brief tutorial to get the hang of how the game you'll be playing works.  Tasks for games include (but are not limited to) flicking to construct machinery, releasing the stylus at the right time to belt out a loud note, sliding to rub a lizard's tail in time to a mating dance beat, tapping to gulp down dumplings, tapping and flicking to harvest vegetables and get rid of moles, and more.  After every four games, a special "remix" game appears, which combines the previous games into a hectic mix, where you never know what will be up next.</desc>

		<desc>Shrek the Third for Nintendo DS is the only Shrek 3 game that does not follow the movie plot. It makes heavy use of the microphone and touchpad to make a unique gaming experience. You can play as Puss in Boots, Prince Artie, and, of course, Shrek. Player controls are almost entirely touch screen based. Each character has his own special ability, so you need to figure out little puzzles and switch characters in order to continue. 

The game features local multiplayer, allowing up to 3 players to play and each control a different character. Multiplayer gameplay is the same as single-player. The game features 3D graphics and lots of VO.</desc>

		<desc>In a frantic battle to the checkered flag, Sonic and friends speed around tracks set in medieval castle ramparts, lush rainforests and bustling cities, all taken from the visually rich and varied universes of Sonic and SEGA. Fan favorites such as Dr. Eggman, Tails, AiAi, Amigo and many more will join Sonic in their custom built vehicles, revving their engines and jostling to stay ahead of the pack. Each character will speed around the track in cars, planes, motorbikes, and in Aiai's case -- a banana mobile! Secret short cuts, swift handling and avoiding strategically placed obstacles are certainly the best way to get to the top of the podium.</desc>

		<name>Sonic Rush</name>
		<desc>Sonic's first outing on the Nintendo DS system features action in two screens with a story featuring Sonic getting involved in another one of Dr. Eggman's evil plots. A mysterious Emerald is left behind by Dr. Eggman, but an unfamiliar character makes off with it before Sonic can investigate! Sonic gives chase, and thus the adventure begins. Playable characters in the game are Sonic the Hedgehog and new character Blaze the Cat. Appearances from other characters include Miles "Tails" Prower, Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit, and Knuckles the Echidna. Each playable character has four moves as well as a variety of "Trick actions" which, when performed, will raise your Tension Gauge. Filling the gauge allows you to do a Boost which will propel Sonic or Blaze at a high speed across the ground or along the air to defeat enemies or move certain blocks.There are 14 levels that play out over both the top and bottom DS screens, giving you a bigger view of your surroundings. You will race through the levels collecting rings, using "gimmicks" such as bungee ropes and giant waterwheels, performing tricks, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies. When you beat each level, or "act", you will face a Boss Act which is played out over the top screen in 3D. In addition to these levels, there are Special Stages. These are played on the touch screen, and unlike the rest of the game, feature control with the stylus. Upon completion of the game, Time Attack mode will be available. In it, you play levels/boss acts for the best time record. Battle Play is a multiplayer mode in which two players compete to finish a level first. It can be played over single-card download or multi-card wireless.</desc>

		<name>Spectrobes</name>
		<desc>Junior Nanairo Interplanetary Patrol officers Rallen and Jeena are on a routine mission when they hear a strange distress call. They find the wreckage of an ancient escape pod. Its inhabitant is in cryogenic sleep and when revived tells them about a terrible new threat: the Krawl. The Krawl are an alien lifeform who consume whole planets, and they have already been spotted in this part of the galaxy. 

Fortunately, there is a way to defeat them. This requires the help of an extinct lifeform called Spectrobes. Rallen and Jeena must visit planets to find fossils of these Spectrobes, excavate, awaken and train them. There are almost 500 different ones for the player to collect and trade. To excavate a Spectrobe, the player must first locate it using another Spectrobe. Using the stylus on the touch-screen, one can carefully remove layers of rock and soil to dig up the fossil, without damaging it. 

The fossil must then be taken back to the space ship, put in a machine and awakened by using your voice or blowing in the microphone. The soil also contains various crystals and minerals, which can be used to feed and train the Spectrobes. They will evolve to stronger and more effective stages. 

The Krawl are on the planets in the form of vortexes. Walking too close to them triggers a battle, in which two Spectrobes join Rallen against the enemy. With a combination of buttons and shoulderbuttons the Spectrobes can unleash special attack powers or combine their respective attacks in real time action.

Via WiFi and on a dedicated website players can battle against each other or exchange Spectrobes and items. Special collectibles can be downloaded. Items and Spectrobes can also be added to the game using game cards with holes through which the touch-screen must be touched in a specific order.</desc>

		<desc>Based off the 2007 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 3 puts players in charge of the titular hero as he tries to once again New York City safe from the combined menace of the New Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom.

This version of the game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D stylized elements.  The action is primarily controlled using the touch screen.  Players use the stylus for combat, webbing, and item interaction. The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains from the comic book mythos.

One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man's black symbiote costume. When Spider-Man's "Rage" meter builds up, the black suit automatically takes over, allowing Spider-Man to become faster, aggressive, and more powerful.</desc>

		<desc>Life begins as a simple Oogie, a primitive hatchling that falls into the ocean from a fallen spaceship. Soon, this helpless Oogie is thrust into a new world and must evolve to face its challenges.

In Spore Creatures, players must find new body parts and customize their creature to help survive the often-harsh environment. The game's Creature Creator offers a near-infinite number of possibilities with hundreds of options that can improve and alter your creature. Players can choose to create aggressive carnivores, cute and cuddly herbivores, or anything in between.

As the story unfolds, your creature will discover six new planets to explore, as well as dozens of bizarre species to befriend, intimidate, or eliminate. Spore Creatures is entirely touch screen based, with activities for dancing, cuddling, and fighting other species. Players can also collect 50 achievement badges to unlock new game modes, parts, and features.

Spore Creatures allows players to upload their favorite creatures to the internet using the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Other players' species will "pollinate" the Nintendo DS game, appearing throughout the game's story.</desc>

Upset by witnessing devastation that the first World War will cause, he is determined to stop it at all costs, however, his backstabbing assistant Dr. Klaus Scythe takes the time machine and plans to acquire weapons from the future to rule the world for himself and it is up to Dr. Clock to stop him.

The main idea of the game is to fly in 3-D modeled planes, ranging from World War II fighter planes, to modern day jet fighters and up to space fighters of the future.  There are 19 levels to explore, picking up various power-ups scattered throughout the level to upgrade armor, firepower and speed.

There is also multiplayer ability using Wi-Fi where players can dogfight head-to-head in the plane of their choice or four players can play in a variety of minigames like racing.</desc>

		<name>TrackMania DS</name>
		<desc>The TrackMania series is now going portable with this Nintendo DS release.

Race with over 100 tracks by yourself or with your friends. The new modes exclusive to the game are 'Platform', in which you must navigate through complex levels without using too many retries, and 'Puzzle', in which you must create your own map with checkpoints and a limited number of building blocks to connect the pieces, and race to the finish, while the 'Race' mode is left intact. The game includes three environments to race: Desert (the environment used in TrackMania Original), Rally and Stadium (the environment used in TrackMania Nations).

Instead of complex racing simulators where you have to measure a correct speed to turn through narrow roads, this is an arcade-style racing game with high speeds (over 400 km/h!) and simple controls. All you have is accelerate, brake, horn and that's it! Of course, like it's PC counterparts, you can freely reset the track if you fall of the track, or if you want a better medal. There are three types of medals: bronze, silver and gold. You can either race with AI opponents or race by yourself. The main objective is to get to the finish line as fast as possible. The target time is given to you at the beginning of every track, depending on for which medal you are racing.

The game also includes a built-in map editor, which allows you to create a custom map with your stylus.</desc>

		<desc>First installation of the Burnout-series on handheld consoles combines the best features of the first three games: Burnout, Burnout 2: Point of Impact, and Burnout 3: Takedown.  Aggressive racing is still the centerpiece attraction of Burnout Legends and the player's task is not only to win the races but also crash opponent cars as much as possible.  Opponent takedowns, drifts, and other stunts award Burnout Points which in turn unlock new cars and other awards.

One player games can be played as single events or as a World Tour where the player needs to compete in different races and succeed in them in order to advance through five car classes (Compact, Muscle, Coupe, Sport, and Super).  In addition there is the Crash mode, where the goal is to create as much wreckage as possible by ploughing the player car into the traffic.  The different race types include Race, Time Attack, Road Rage, Pursuit, Face Off, Eliminator, Burning Lap, and Grand Prix.  Multiplayer game modes include Race, Road Rage, Pursuit, special Crash modes Double Impact and Party Crash (all these can can be played as single events or as a tournament), and Collector Challenge where the player has the opportunity to win other player's Collector cars.

PSP version game sharing feature allows others to play multiplayer events or single player demo without their own Burnout Legends UMD.

DS version Multi-Pak support allows two player games without additional game cards.  More than two player games require multiple game cards.</desc>

		<desc>The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian takes players throughout Narnia and includes a level, which is unique from both the novel and the film. The level, which is set between the events of "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe" and Prince Caspian, takes place at the castle of Cair Paravel and tells the story of how Narnia fell to the Telmarine hordes. In Prince Caspian, Cair Paravel is seen only as abandoned ruins the Pevensies discover hundreds of years later. The action/adventure game offers gameplay for one or two players on the same system and drop-in/drop-out features, allowing either player to join the game and leave. With combat, exploration and puzzle solving that extends beyond the film, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is the ideal complement to the movie-going experience. The game features more than 20 playable characters including the ability to play as Prince Caspian.</desc>

		<name>Electroplankton</name>
		<desc>In Electroplankton players interact with various "plankton" to create "media art". Using the DS touch screen, microphone, and other input methods, you can make the plankton to react, creating numerous audio and visual experiences.

There are two modes Performance and Audience. In Audience, the plankton will perform for you, as long as you see fit, or your battery will allow. In Performance you can interact with the plankton and create your own audio-visual show.

The Various Plankton are as follows 

1. Tracy: You will have several plankton. They will move along lines you draw for them, their speed varying on how quickly you drew the lines. The sound they create changes depending on their speed and where they are on the screen. 

2. Hanenbow: These little creatures launch out of a small body of water and bounce off the leaves of plants. Depending on the levees they bounce off of they will create different sounds. 

3. Luminaria: You will have four plankton on a grid. Each has a different speed. Depending on what point on the grid they hit they will make a different sound. Arrows on the grid, that you can alter, will determine where they move. 

4. Sun-Animalcule: You place these little creatures on the screen and they will grow. As the become larger they will create different sounds. 

5. Rec-Rec:  Using the mic you can record four samples that then replay with various drumloops. 

6. Nanocarp: These little plankton move about the screen randomly, they will alter how they move according to what you input. Touching one will make it "pling" and clapping twice will make them swim in a circle. 

7. Lumiloop: You spin them around. They glow and make sound according to the direction and speed. 

8. Marine-Snow – Each of these plankton will make a tone when touched, and move about. 

9. Beatnes: Plays NES music and you can create repeating NES-esque music by touching the plankton on various parts of their bodies. 

10. Volvoice: This plankton will record you voiced and the play it back in different ways.</desc>

		<desc>Brand new this year is the 360 degree dribbling system, giving you the most precise control ever. There are also changes to how the defensive line is formed, as well as improvements to crosses, freekicks and goalkeepers (who can now receive red cards).

Naturally the game retains its hugely successful on and offline multiplayer modes, with new options and better stability for online play. The manager mode has also seen a massive update to make it just as deep and complex as the main game. With all these new features and more EA Sports are betting on FIFA remaining the champions for a long time to come.</desc>

		<desc>FIFA 11 reinvents player authenticity - on and off the ball - for every player and at every position on the pitch with Personality+, an all-new feature that sees individual abilities reflected in game, enabling clear differentiation for every player.

With Personality+ a footballer's abilities on the pitch is mirrored authentically in game, creating individual personalities. Players will be distinguished from one another through a sophisticated database that evaluates and grades each player's skill-set over 36 attributes and 57 traits, compiled by 1700 scouts around the world. Real Madrid's Kaka will deliver crisp, creative passes, Barcelona's Andres Iniesta will utilize tighter turns and close control to dribble through defenses, Manchester United's Wayne Rooney will hold off defenders and strike shots from distance with pace, and top-flight defenders like Giorgio Chiellini of Juventus will anticipate, predict and react to offensive players to win back possession.</desc>

4. Drafting: stay in the opponent's slipstream to raise a power bar.

5. Driving Skills: race against the time and keep the timer going by passing through gates that award time bonuses.

6. Seconds Out: race against the time while collecting bonuses.

7. Time Attack: a straightforward timed race.

8. Boost: race with two boosts per lap.

9. Relay: transfer a baton three times around the track.

		<desc>Take on the role of Harry, Ron and Hermione as they begin their fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year, the Triwizard Tournament takes place, and Harry is mysteriously entered into the tournament himself.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance is a top-down action/adventure game where you play as the three friends and progress through the story based on the book and film.

Make your way through various scenarios by attacking enemies and solving puzzles using spells. One button fires a ranged spell, such as Confoundus, while another is used for stream spells, like Wingardium Leviosa, which can be moved around with the Control Pad. You can also call your friends for added power to your magical spells.

The DS version includes a small bonus game where you take care of a magical creature called a 'Niffler'. It is a simulation game, like a very simple Tamagotchi. You can feed the Niffler, clean it, and give it toys - depending on what you do, it will become more or less pleased with you.  Perform well enough, and it will become really happy, and let you pat it to make it even happier.</desc>

		<desc>In Lost Magic the player controls Isaac, a young Wizard who initially sets out looking for his missing father. Soon his investigations uncover a threat to the world by the evil Diva of Twilight.

Lost Magic is a game that where the primary focus is combat, with little in the way of exploration to interrupt the main theme of the game.  The stylus is used to direct the player's allies, (monsters captured by Isaac)and to cast spells.

The focus of the game is capturing monsters to later help the Isaac defeat the more powerful foes. Up to 400 different spells can be cast, many in combination with others to create new effects. The challenge lies in using the stylus quickly and accurately to not only combine these spells, but to effectively direct the real time battles.

The game supports Wi-Fi as well as both single and multi cartridge  versions of multiplayer.</desc>

		<name>Meteos</name>
		<desc>Designed by Masahiro Sakurai and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Meteos was the DS's second big-name puzzle game (after Polarium).  

Most of the game's action takes place on the bottom of the DS's two screens, where colored meteors plummet downwards towards a planet's atmosphere.  There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button.  When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they "ignite" and rocket up towards the top screen.  Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once.  The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into "orbit" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors.  Meteos features many different "planets" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.</desc>

Pac-Man must roll his way through Ghost-Land, collecting pellets and confronting Ghosts to save his family and restore peace to Pac-Land. Introducing an innovative new control scheme, Pac'N Roll lets players control Pac-Man with the Nintendo DS stylus. Players can roll and dash around the environment as well as execute maneuvers such as hairpin turns, immediate stops and precision rolling with effortless strokes of the stylus. In his quest to save Pac-Land, Pac-Man will venture through stages such as Castle Pac, Gyro-Jungle and the Ghost House, while facing perilous hazards like moving floors, dash panels, jump zones and wind zones. Along the way, Pac-Man will find power-ups like the Winged Chocolate, allowing him to fly through the worlds and jump over Ghosts, or the "Knight Chocolate," providing him with armor which grants him the power to crash through walls and withstand more damage. Pac'N Roll also includes the original Pac-Man arcade game, allowing up to two players to munch on pellets and claim the highest score.</desc>

		<name>Pac-pix</name>
		<desc>Pac-Pix originally started as a tech-demo for the Nintendo DS when the DS was first announced. Many people at E3 liked the demo so much that Namco made it a full-fledged game. In this DS exclusive title, Pac-Man has been captured by the ghosts and you must save him. You use the touch-screen to draw Pac-Man and try to eat the ghosts.  There are a few different types of ghosts that require a different strategy for each type.

You have Pinky that just moves around slowly and Blue that will make a quick dash as you approach him. There is Numboos which is multiple ghosts with numbers and you must eat them in order if you wish to defeat them. Bari-Boo has a shield and you can only defeat him by attacking from behind, if you hit his shield in front of him or from the side you just bounce off. There's the ink ghosts which throw ink and then there's the block ghosts which require you to break their defenses with a bomb.

During your adventure you will learn to draw arrows to shoot ghosts and stun them, as well as ghosts that are floating in bubbles. You will also be able to draw bombs to destroy blocks that are in your path. There are many things to do with the touch screen in this game. Pac-Pix is a Pac-Man game like no other before it.</desc>

		<name>Polarium</name>
		<desc>This is a puzzle game similar to Tetris in that blocks fall from above, and to clear the lines before the screen fills up, you must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white).  To change the color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select it with the stylus, then tap it again to make the block flip.  You can also drag the stylus along the screen to change the polarity if many block at the same time.

There is also a puzzle mode where time isn't as critical.  Blocks aren't falling, but are just in a certain pattern on the screen.  The object is to make the polarity of every block in each horizontal line the same.  But the trick is to do the entire screen with one swipe of the stylus.  There are 100 puzzles in this mode and they can get very difficult.

The most addicting part of this game is the multiplayer.  Utilizing the DS's two screens, you can see your blocks and your opponent's blocks.  As you create a horizontal line all of the same polarity, that line is then scrambled and sent to your adversary.  The object is to clear your screen before your opponent does.  The multiplayer mode does not require 2 Game Cards to play.  In fact, when the game is sent over to another DS through the IPL, they don't even need to play multiplayer.  The person that received the game can play a simple demo of the game by themselves.</desc>

		<name>Puyo Pop Fever</name>
		<desc>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!  

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</desc>

		<desc>Ridge Racer DS is a remake of Ridge Racer 64 with some changes and additions.  All the same levels are there, but there are plenty of new cars, including Namco- and Nintendo-themed vehicles.  There is also some new music that was not in the N64 version.

The Touch Screen on the Nintendo DS is put to use all throughout the game, including navigation through every menu and even a revolutionary new control where the player steers the steering wheel with the stylus or thumb ring.

Another addition to the game is the use of the Nintendo DS's Wi-Fi capabilities.  Using wireless communication, up to 6 players can race against each other.  In fact, up to 6 players can play with a Game Card in only one of the systems.  The other 5 players don't even need the game.  There will be more items, such as cars, available to play with if all of the systems have a Ridge Racer DS Game Card in though.  So there is an advantage to having multiple Game Cards.</desc>

		<name>Robots</name>
		<desc>Based on the Blue Sky film (distributed by Fox) of the same name,
Robots takes players on an adventure to save Robot city. When Rodney Copperbottom travels to Robot City to meet Big Weld, the famous inventor, he finds that something is wrong. Big Weld is missing and the evil Ratchet has taken over Big Weld Industries. With the help of his friends the Rusties, Rodney puts an end to Ratchet's villainous ways and restores order to the city.

Robots uses a unique perspective that combines 2D side-scrolling with 3D views. The game takes the player to locations from the movie like Robot City, Big Weld's Mansion, the Outmode, and Madame Gasket's Chop Shop. Using the invention mode, players build and upgrade Rodney's weapons including the wrench, scrap gun, electro zapper, and magno grenade. With a combination of navigation, jumping, and combat skills, players can make their way though the world of Robots and bring an end to Ratchet's tyranny.

In addition to the main story line, players will find robots in need all over the city. The parts these poor robots are missing can be found hidden in the numerous maps and returning the correct part rewards the player with power-ups and weapon upgrades. All of the maps are interconnected, so players can easily find their way back to a previous area to uncover additional secrets.The maps are connected with a transit ball mini-game, just like the transit system in the movie.

The DS version of the game features a map that can be annotated by the player, a unique 3D version of the transit ball game that utilizes the stylus for control, and 3D menus. In addition to the new features, the DS also includes high resolution maps that include more detail than the GBA version.</desc>

		<desc>Get ready for a different kind of brawl as Shrek steps into the ring with nine of his crazy friends like Donkey, Princess Fiona and the idle Prince Charming! 10 battle levels and stunning attacks like Puss in Boot's Love Stun and Shrek's very unpleasant Green Storm, which take combative attacks to a whole new level. Not only is it a lot of fun to watch Shrek and his friends, but also to play with it! With a load of weapons, magic potions and magical items to bring in the victory, you can grab a viking helmet, transform yourself into a living battering ram or beating your opponents with a big Ham Hock! And with violent attacks that make the ground shake you can ruin your environment and pulverize the walls beneath your sulking blows, let Shrek pound you more than just your own opponents! Then there is the fantastic multiplayer mode, where four players can compete against each other. You will also find 25 mini-games, which you can play if you get tired of all that action. This is THE Grand Slam ...</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to Snood keeps the gameplay from the original game but takes it to locations around the world. In this puzzle game players need to line up groups of three or more adjacent Snoods to remove them, similar to the Bust-a-move series. They are launched from the Snood-o-matic cannon at the bottom of the screen. For every Snood launched, the danger level increases and causes the Snoods at the top to move downwards. When the bottom is reached, the game is lost.</desc>

		<name>Sonic Rush</name>
		<desc>Sonic's first outing on the Nintendo DS system features action in two screens with a story featuring Sonic getting involved in another one of Dr. Eggman's evil plots. A mysterious Emerald is left behind by Dr. Eggman, but an unfamiliar character makes off with it before Sonic can investigate! Sonic gives chase, and thus the adventure begins. Playable characters in the game are Sonic the Hedgehog and new character Blaze the Cat. Appearances from other characters include Miles "Tails" Prower, Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit, and Knuckles the Echidna. Each playable character has four moves as well as a variety of "Trick actions" which, when performed, will raise your Tension Gauge. Filling the gauge allows you to do a Boost which will propel Sonic or Blaze at a high speed across the ground or along the air to defeat enemies or move certain blocks.There are 14 levels that play out over both the top and bottom DS screens, giving you a bigger view of your surroundings. You will race through the levels collecting rings, using "gimmicks" such as bungee ropes and giant waterwheels, performing tricks, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies. When you beat each level, or "act", you will face a Boss Act which is played out over the top screen in 3D. In addition to these levels, there are Special Stages. These are played on the touch screen, and unlike the rest of the game, feature control with the stylus. Upon completion of the game, Time Attack mode will be available. In it, you play levels/boss acts for the best time record. Battle Play is a multiplayer mode in which two players compete to finish a level first. It can be played over single-card download or multi-card wireless.</desc>

		<name>Tao's Adventure : Curse of the Demon Seal</name>
		<desc>In Tao's Adventure: Curse of the Demon Seal, the player controls the young Air Speller by the name of Tao. When his village gets attacked by Ancient Monsters, he is sent by the council over to the town of Mondominio to seek the help of a friend of his father. Mondominio is famous for containing the Monster Tower which was sealed for many years until a lightning storm hit the tower and broke the seal.

The game plays quite similarly to Azure Dreams. Most of it is based around leveling up, learning new spells, and collecting monster eggs from the monster tower, and then selling them in town or hatching them as pets that will aid you in your quest. The player begins with the basic elemental spells which are cast using the DS stylus. The battles, movements, and almost any action taken in the monster tower is turn-based. The higher the player progresses up the tower levels, the stronger the enemies become. With every five levels of the tower, the player will encounter a boss.</desc>

Nintendo DS players will also take Sk8land online through the wi-fi mode, along with touch screen controls. GBA players aren't left behind either, with an updated create-a-park and skater modes and multiplayer to boot.</desc>

		<desc>A pure adventure game for the Nintendo DS platform. You play as teen Ashley. Raised by her aunt Jessica, Ashley believed both of her parents were dead; on the eve of her 14th birthday, she receives a strange letter and a device called a DTS from her father. She and her aunt are summoned to Blood Edward Island, which is where the game begins.

Near the beginning of the game, you meet the ghost of a boy who can't remember his past. Over the course of the game, you will uncover the truth of both your own past and this mysterious boy's.

Much use is made of the unique features of the DS. You will use the stylus, the microphone, and even the "sleep" feature in addition to more traditional puzzle solutions. Your character cannot die; there are no action or arcade sequences.</desc>

		<name>Ultimate Spider-man</name>
		<desc>For Ultimate Spider-Man for the DS, developer Vicarious Visions takes the technology and gameplay style  of their earlier Spider-Man 2 to adapt the storyline of the console version for the handheld.

Based on the Ultimate Spider-Man comic series, the game follows up on the comic's storyline about Peter Parker's childhood friend Eddie Brock and the Venom suit. Three months after his apparent death, Venom roams the streets of New York again. Thus Spider-Man must not only deal with the usual assortment of criminals and supervillains but also his old friend, while both Trask Industries and S.H.I.E.L.D. have set their sights on Eddie, who struggles to take control of the Venom suit. The DS game follows a cut-down version of the console version's storyline, but differs a lot in the details. The story is told in comic-style cutscenes that emulate the drawings of series artist Mark Bagley and also feature voice acting.

The game is a 2D side-scroller with real 3D graphics, with the camera moving and rotating to always keep the protagonist in view. Players will play as both Spider-Man and Venom, who have different abilities and are controlled in fundamentally different ways. Both must beat up various enemies and fight bosses, but other goals vary between the two.

Spider-Man is controlled via a standard button interface, allowing him to jump, swing along his web, punch, kick, shoot web balls and use his web to zip to walls and ceilings. When attack moves are stringed into combos, a power meter fills up that allows Spidey to unleash a special move that can be selected beforehand from the touch screen. His Spider-Sense also comes into play: when in immediate danger, an icon flashes. Pressing the left shoulder button within time allows Spider-Man to dodge the attack that follows.

A large part of Spider-Man's levels consists of rescuing innocents - freeing them from below heavy objects or carrying them away from danger. Lifting up the objects requires stroking upwards on the touch screen. The screen is also used for modifying electronics or disarming bombs. Lights flash up on a grid: green ones must be touched and red ones avoided.

In contrast, Venom is controlled almost exclusively through the touch screen. Alternate button-based controls are available but don't offer the full variety of moves. Venom can attack through either his claws or his tendrils by tapping either close or away from him. He can also use his tendrils to pick up objects and enemies and throw them around or smash them to the ground, all done through stylus movements. A further use of the tendrils is a targeted attack launched by stroking away from Venom in the wanted direction. 
Another gameplay element that only applies to Venom is feeding. The Venom suit drains Eddie's health constantly, so he must feed on humans to survive. This is done by simply tapping and holding the intended victim.

The game features branching paths: at some points, players can choose where to continue with the story (like Spider-Man choosing on whether to confront Shocker or the Rhino), leading to different sets of levels.

A multiplayer mode is also available: it features five different characters and eight arenas for one-on-one fights.</desc>

Double Trouble is a standard side-scrolling beat-em-up in the vein of earlier entries in the Viewtiful Joe series. As with earlier entries in the series, Double Trouble sets itself apart from other games in the genre with the inclusion of VFX powers. The VFX powers in this game include:

Slow - Joe's signature VFX move, this allows him to slow down time to effectively dodge and counter enemy attacks.
Scratch - Shake things up and drop items on enemies, or just shake them until they're dizzy.
Split - Alter your environment by cutting a new path yourself.
Slide - Get a closeup view of the action and add a little extra power to Joe's hits.</desc>

		<name>Whac-a-mole</name>
		<desc>This is an adaption of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo's handheld devices. At the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.

The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which  once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it's own graphical theme.

The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so. The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up. However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location.

The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what difficulty and then try to be successful. The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.</desc>

		<name>Yoshi Touch &amp; Go</name>
		<desc>Yoshi Touch &amp; Go is based on a tech demo that Nintendo showed at trade shows to demonstrate the technical abilities of the DS. Like in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Yoshi is carrying Baby Mario on his back and is walking through the countryside. There are enemies, pits in the ground, and other obstacles you must circumnavigate. You do not control Yoshi; you must use the stylus to draw alternate paths (made of small clouds), kill enemies, and throw eggs for him. There is only one level, but it can be played as a Marathon game, Time Attack, Score Attack, and a couple other modes. You can also play against a friend in Versus mode.</desc>

		<desc>The zoo animals have revolted against the zoo keeper.  It is your job to restore order and "capture" all of the animals.

In this colorful and fast-paced match-up game, players select animals of the same type using either the touch-screen or a standard controller. Line like animals up in rows by swapping them from spot to spot in the time allowed. 

There are 5 varied game play modes: Normal, Tokoton, Quest, Time Attack and 2P.  Normal mode has you clearing a set amount of animals each level before progressing to the next.  Tokoton is similar to Normal, but has all the animal amounts set to 100 before you'll level up.  Quest has you playing ten set stages with specific goals (such as only capturing animals of a certain type) that you must attempt to achieve.  Time Attack has you aiming to get the highest score possible in the time limit.  2P has two players battling it out against each other.</desc>

		<desc>Cooking Mama is, as the name implies, a game where you cook!

The player takes orders from various customers and then has to prepare the to fit their order and to satisfy their tastes. The way the meal is prepared is up to the player, and a number of different ingredients are available.

Each preparation section is timed, as well as this, players are marked on the final product.

The touch screen is used to slice and soak vegetables, marinade meat, peel fruit and of course cook it on the stove.

The screen allows for more sensitive and easier interaction allowing a more realistic and hands on cooking experience than a mouse or controller could.</desc>

		<name>Electroplankton</name>
		<desc>In Electroplankton players interact with various "plankton" to create "media art". Using the DS touch screen, microphone, and other input methods, you can make the plankton to react, creating numerous audio and visual experiences.

There are two modes Performance and Audience. In Audience, the plankton will perform for you, as long as you see fit, or your battery will allow. In Performance you can interact with the plankton and create your own audio-visual show.

The Various Plankton are as follows 

1. Tracy: You will have several plankton. They will move along lines you draw for them, their speed varying on how quickly you drew the lines. The sound they create changes depending on their speed and where they are on the screen. 

2. Hanenbow: These little creatures launch out of a small body of water and bounce off the leaves of plants. Depending on the levees they bounce off of they will create different sounds. 

3. Luminaria: You will have four plankton on a grid. Each has a different speed. Depending on what point on the grid they hit they will make a different sound. Arrows on the grid, that you can alter, will determine where they move. 

4. Sun-Animalcule: You place these little creatures on the screen and they will grow. As the become larger they will create different sounds. 

5. Rec-Rec:  Using the mic you can record four samples that then replay with various drumloops. 

6. Nanocarp: These little plankton move about the screen randomly, they will alter how they move according to what you input. Touching one will make it "pling" and clapping twice will make them swim in a circle. 

7. Lumiloop: You spin them around. They glow and make sound according to the direction and speed. 

8. Marine-Snow – Each of these plankton will make a tone when touched, and move about. 

9. Beatnes: Plays NES music and you can create repeating NES-esque music by touching the plankton on various parts of their bodies. 

10. Volvoice: This plankton will record you voiced and the play it back in different ways.</desc>

		<desc>Ride into adventure with Link and Princess Zelda.

? Wield weapons and solve puzzles, all with your stylus

? Duke it out with friends in multiplayer battle mode

? Link and Zelda adventure together for the first time

The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks sets hero Link on a daring new adventure. The game provides players with a new story, more puzzles and even a new mode of transportation. In this game, Link voyages by train, which offers up new possibilities for problem-solving. The game has the same look and feel established in the hit Nintendo DS game The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass.

? Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he?s accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touchscreen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm.

? When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks.

? Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system.

? As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.</desc>

While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks.

? Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system.

? As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.</desc>

		<name>Magnetica</name>
		<desc>Playing with balls is fun! Magnetica is a fiendish action puzzler game from Japanese developer Mitchell Corporation, and the sequel to the 1998 arcade game Puzz Loop. Marbles will relentlessly roll across twisted tracks and into a hole in its center. When three same-coloured marbles touch each other, they destroy themselves. With the DS Stylus, players must shoot same-coloured marbles into the oncoming rows in order to prevent them from falling down the hole and thus clear a track. The twist is that now, marbles that share the same color will attract each other!

Magnetica takes advantage of the Nintendo DS hardware for precise touch-screen functionality and brings a new play mechanic to the famous puzzle. Test your ball-shooting skills in Challenge Mode, Puzzle Mode, Quest Mode and more.</desc>

		<desc>Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis is an action/puzzle game where the object is to bring as many Mini-Marios to the exit door as possible by solving the puzzle. All the puzzles are fairly small and take up anywhere from one screen to four screens (2x2) in size. All the Mini-Marios that are collected in each room are then used in the Donkey Kong boss battle at the end of the world. All of the control is done with the stylus; no buttons are used at all.</desc>

		<name>Meteos</name>
		<desc>Designed by Masahiro Sakurai and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Meteos was the DS's second big-name puzzle game (after Polarium).  

Most of the game's action takes place on the bottom of the DS's two screens, where colored meteors plummet downwards towards a planet's atmosphere.  There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button.  When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they "ignite" and rocket up towards the top screen.  Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once.  The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into "orbit" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors.  Meteos features many different "planets" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Picross Ds</name>
		<desc>Picross DS is a touch screen-based puzzle game for the Nintendo DS.  By following the numbers on the left and top of the game grid, players can uncover the picture hidden away.  The rules are simple - if there is one number on a line, say, 10, then you know that there are ten squares in a row that must be chipped away on that line.  If the numbers read something like 2 7, then you must chip away two squares somewhere in the row, separated by at least one empty square, and then seven squares to be chipped away.  By applying these rules horizontally and vertically to the grid, you can work out the picture using logic.

There are two methods of control: you can use the Control Pad to move a cursor, the A Button to chip a square, the B Button to mark it, and the X Button to zoom in or out (similar to Nintendo's previous Picross games).  Alternatively, you can use the stylus to play.  In this mode, the Control Pad changes the functions of the stylus.  When you press Up, you'll chip squares, Down will mark them, Left will zoom in and out, while Right allows you to scroll.  The buttons on the right of the DS perform the same functions, which is helpful if you're left-handed.

Picross DS has a variety of different modes:

1.  Picross - This is standard Picross.  Play through easy, medium and difficult puzzles, or learn how to play.  You are penalized with time for any mistakes you make in easy and medium modes.  In difficult, your mistakes are not noted at all.

2.  Daily Picross - Play a quick set of five Picross puzzles, once a day.  Each day, your score is added to a chart, so you can track whether you're improving or getting worse, similar to Brain Age.

3.  My Picross - Design your own Picross puzzles by drawing on the grid.  When you're done, you can play your puzzles, or send them to others.

4.  Competition Picross - Play Picross against others in this mode.  You can choose to use single-cart multiplayer, multi-cart multiplayer, or online play via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

You can also download additional puzzle packs for Picross DS by using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, including puzzles from Mario's Picross.</desc>

		<desc>Originally conceived as a launch title before Pictochat was announced as a packed-in feature of the DS, Ping Pals lets players create an avatar to send chats and doodles wirelessly with your friends.  Although only one person needs a Ping Pals cartridge to start the chat, the game uses unlockable clothing and accessories as incentive to purchase their own cartridge and chat away.  Got no friends?  Ping Pals can even simulate chat with a simple AI chatbot.

Players can purchase items from a store using coins or trade for them with other players.  Coins are earned in various ways, including receiving a daily allowance, chatting for a long time, typing special predetermined keywords, and playing minigames.</desc>

		<name>Planet 51 - The Game</name>
		<desc>Planet 51 is a galactic sized alien adventure comedy from the writer of "Shrek" and "Shrek 2", the story revolves around American astronaut Captain Charles "Chuck" Baker who lands on Planet 51 thinking he's the first person to step foot there. To his surprise he finds that this planet is inhabited by little green people who are happily living in a white picket fence world, reminiscent of a cheerfully innocent 1950s America, and whose only fear is that it will be overrun by alien invaders...like Chuck! With the help of his robot companion "Rover", and his new friend Lem, Chuck must navigate his way through the dazzling, but bewildering, landscape of Planet 51 in order to escape becoming a permanent part of the Planet 51 Alien Invaders Space Museum. The Planet 51 game will take the form of an entertaining mission-based driving game with various characters from the film available to play. The game allows audiences to immerse themselves into this amazing vibrant world, and truly experience the hours of fun that Planet 51 has to offer!</desc>

		<name>Planet Puzzle League</name>
		<desc>Take on the world in Planet Puzzle League, a simple but addictive puzzle game that you may recognize as Tetris Attack, Panel De Pon, or Pokémon Puzzle League.  Colored tiles rise up from a bin, and its your job to arrange them horizontally or vertically in lines of three or more of the same tile.  This causes them to disappear.  Advanced players will be able to arrange tiles so that when they land, they clear additional tiles to stop the tiles from rising and score even more points!

Planet Puzzle League features a wide variety of different game modes to keep even the most dedicated puzzler busy:

1.  Endless - Play forever until you fail.  The tiles rise faster over time.
2.  Clear - Remove all the blocks down to the 'CLEAR' line, buried deep down.
3.  Garbage Challenge - Garbage blocks rain down on your bin - clear as many as you can!
4.  Vs. COM - Play against the CPU.  Try to get their tiles to reach the top of the bin first!
5.  Time Attack - See how many points you can earn in two minutes.
6.  Puzzle - Either clear the preset mind-bending puzzles, or try the various missions that you are given.

Similar to Brain Age, Planet Puzzle League features a 'Daily' Mode.  Play these short games once a day to track your skill over a long period of time.  Are you getting better?  Or worse?

You can also play multiplayer modes of the game, either locally, or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Modes of play include Birthday Battle (play against people who share your date of birth), Free Play Battle (play an unranked match), and Friend Battle (play against Friends you've traded Friend Codes with).</desc>

		<desc>Take on the world in Planet Puzzle League, a simple but addictive puzzle game that you may recognize as Tetris Attack, Panel De Pon, or Pokémon Puzzle League.  Colored tiles rise up from a bin, and its your job to arrange them horizontally or vertically in lines of three or more of the same tile.  This causes them to disappear.  Advanced players will be able to arrange tiles so that when they land, they clear additional tiles to stop the tiles from rising and score even more points!

Planet Puzzle League features a wide variety of different game modes to keep even the most dedicated puzzler busy:

1.  Endless - Play forever until you fail.  The tiles rise faster over time.
2.  Clear - Remove all the blocks down to the 'CLEAR' line, buried deep down.
3.  Garbage Challenge - Garbage blocks rain down on your bin - clear as many as you can!
4.  Vs. COM - Play against the CPU.  Try to get their tiles to reach the top of the bin first!
5.  Time Attack - See how many points you can earn in two minutes.
6.  Puzzle - Either clear the preset mind-bending puzzles, or try the various missions that you are given.

Similar to Brain Age, Planet Puzzle League features a 'Daily' Mode.  Play these short games once a day to track your skill over a long period of time.  Are you getting better?  Or worse?

You can also play multiplayer modes of the game, either locally, or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Modes of play include Birthday Battle (play against people who share your date of birth), Free Play Battle (play an unranked match), and Friend Battle (play against Friends you've traded Friend Codes with).</desc>
