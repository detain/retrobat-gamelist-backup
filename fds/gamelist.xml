		<desc>I Am a Teacher: Super Mario Sweater was designed to be a sewing simulator. Players were able to design sweaters, adding pictures of famous characters such as Mario,Luigi, Peach and Bowser in the process. It was devised by Royal industries Co. Ltd., a Japanese appliance and sewing machine company. Royal industries Co. Ltd. realized that they could profit from a sweater-design program, which led to the development of this game.</desc>

		<name>I Am A Teacher - Teami No Kiso</name>
		<desc>I Am A Teacher: Teami no Kiso (roughly "I Am A Teacher: The Basics of Hand-Knitting") is an instructional tool to help would-be knitters create their own garments. The user can input the amount, length and type of wool they have and the size and type of the item of clothing they wish to create and the program will put together a guide to help them achieve this goal. The user can save their progress at any time and pick up from where they left off.

Unlike Super Mario no Sweater, its predecessor in the I Am A Teacher series, there are no Nintendo characters present in Teami no Kiso. Rather, Teami no Kiso is a guide for teaching the fundamentals of knitting to novices, with Super Mario no Sweater intended for those who already have some experience who wish to try new Mario-themed designs.

As with Super Mario no Sweater, Teami no Kiso was commissioned by major Japanese wool and sewing products manufacturer Royal Kougyou, but it's believed that Nintendo developed and published the game themselves.</desc>

		<name>Tarot Uranai</name>
		<desc>Tarot Uranai (Lit. Tarot fortune telling) is a fortune telling simulation developed and published by Scorpion Soft for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. During play, the game predicts the player's future in several areas, including love, finance, and education. It followed a series of other astrological "utility" programs for the platform, including Chuugoku Senseijutsu and '89 Dennou Kyuusei Uranai.

The game focuses on the Tarot deck and their supposed clairvoyant properties. The game will randomly shuffle a deck and lay them out in a formation of the player's choosing - each formation is meant to predict a different aspect of the player's life. The game will then reveal cards that the player chooses and decipher the meaning behind them.</desc>

		<name>Michael English Daibouken</name>
		<desc>Michael English Daibouken (lit: "Michael's English Grand Adventure") is an educational game where the character of Michael, an orange cat, teaches kittens the various letters in the English language as well as some English vocabulary. Michael has to catch floating letters in order to spell out English words, while avoiding the incorrect letters. The game has various different backdrops, including space.

The character of Michael comes from the Japanese serial manga strip "What's Michael", created by Makoto Kobayashi which might be considered analogous to Garfield, due to them both being orange cats. It varies between observing goofy pet behavior to more abstract tales of fantasy with anthropomorphized versions of the animal characters.</desc>

		<name>Explosive Fighter Patton</name>
		<desc>Bakutoushi Patton-Kun is an overhead tank combat game similar in style to Atari's Combat game. It was the first FDS title to allow for four players to play simultaneously. In the game, players attempt to destroy each others tanks. If a tank is destroyed, the driver of the tank will exit the vehicle, and must try to stay alive long enough for a replacement tank to parachute down from the sky. Game play continues until only one tank is the sole survivor. Then players advance to a new stage with different terrain. There are 56 stages in total. Tank stats can also be changed in an Editor mode. Despite referencing the name of American General George S. Patton in the title, there is no mention of him anywhere else throughout the game. Although the game was only release in Japan, the loading screen instructions contain English profanity.</desc>

		<desc>Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet. As the eponymous hero, your job is to destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels.The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo.</desc>

		<name>Othello</name>
		<desc>Othello is a conversion of the board game. Each player tries to fill the game board with as many discs of his color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the board by selecting a location where the opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The trapped discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out, and the player with the greatest number of his color discs on the board wins. Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.</desc>

The laser cannot hit any of the stage's surrounding wall: were it do so, it would cause the level to explode and the player to lose a life (from an initial allotment of five, though this can be increased while playing the game). Much of the time the various reflectors (which send the beam off at a 90 degree angle) and blocks (which simply stop the laser in its tracks) must be maneuvered into place before the laser should be tested on them.</desc>

		<desc>Janken Disk Jou, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 6 Janken Disk Jou, is a puzzle game in which the protagonist (who looks uncannily like Disk-kun, the mascot of the Famicom Disk System) must brave a labyrinth of puzzles. In each room there are three variants of hand-shaped blocks between the hero and the exit: each one either making the "scissors" gesture, the "rock" gesture or the "paper" gesture. Pushing a block adjacent to another of a different type causes whichever was the inferior (e.g. with paper and rock, rock is the inferior) to vanish. In addition, each block has a "strength" which is signified by its color: green is level 1, yellow is level 2 and red is level 3. If a green block is pushed next to an inferior red block, the red block will instead become yellow instead of vanishing (and then green with a subsequent superior block, and then will vanish after a third).</desc>

		<name>Golf - Japan Course</name>
		<desc>An update of sorts to Golf. Players get to take control of Nintendo's mascots Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses modeled after real courses in Japan.

Players can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play. Match play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by getting the better score than their competitor. Stroke play differs as it just involves the golfer trying to get the best score possible by completing each hole in as few strokes as possible.

When on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the direction they want to hit the ball. Hitting the ball involves the use of a meter with an icon that goes back and forth, which gauges the distance the ball is hit. Players can take a step back from the tee and take practice swings so they can get into a rhythm using this meter.

This game also contained a now defunct feature where players could record their personal information and their best scores and then bring the game disk to a Disk Fax machine. Inserting the disk into this machine would fax over the player's information to Nintendo's headquarters. This information was used for a contest. Being selected a contest winner would award the player with a golden colored disk version of this game. This golden disk version of the game contained an exclusive course that was not present on the original version of this game.</desc>

		<desc>I Am A Teacher: Teami no Kiso (roughly "I Am A Teacher: The Basics of Hand-Knitting") is an instructional tool to help would-be knitters create their own garments. The user can input the amount, length and type of wool they have and the size and type of the item of clothing they wish to create and the program will put together a guide to help them achieve this goal. The user can save their progress at any time and pick up from where they left off.

Unlike Super Mario no Sweater, its predecessor in the I Am A Teacher series, there are no Nintendo characters present in Teami no Kiso. Rather, Teami no Kiso is a guide for teaching the fundamentals of knitting to novices, with Super Mario no Sweater intended for those who already have some experience who wish to try new Mario-themed designs.

As with Super Mario no Sweater, Teami no Kiso was commissioned by major Japanese wool and sewing products manufacturer Royal Kougyou, but it's believed that Nintendo developed and published the game themselves.</desc>

		<desc>The plot is simple: the Condor has stolen the food supply from the neighboring village and takes it to his nest on the mountain nearby. So it's up to Nana and Popo to climb up the ice-covered top of the mountain to get the vegetables back from Condor. You'll do this by hopping up platforms while avoiding various enemies and obstacles before your time runs out.

Interestingly the Famicom Disk System port is actually based on the arcade version Vs. Ice Climber and differs from the console version in ways such as an animated title screen, stage select menu, 16 additional mountains, occasional blizzard and wind effects, more enemy characters, and bonus multiplier items.</desc>

		<name>Ice Hockey</name>
		<desc>The play and mechanics of Ice Hockey are mostly similar to that of ice hockey in real life. The objective for both team is to hit a black puck with a hockey stick that each player carries into the opponent's goal. Teams are made up of five players including the goaltender, as opposed to six in real life. Players wear ice skates, which are used to skate across the icy arena. Each game is made up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking/defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design. If two opposing players fight for the puck for a certain amount of time, other players join into the fight, resulting in the player from the losing team in the fight to be put in the penalty box for a period of time.</desc>

		<name>Idol Hotline - Nakayama Miho No Tokimeki High School</name>
		<desc>The game's protagonist enters Tokimeki High School and runs into a girl wearing glasses who looks identical to Miho Nakayama. Though the game is a standard text command-style adventure game similar to the Famicom Tantei Club series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the "game over" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other text adventure games where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.</desc>

		<desc>Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku is the first real attempt to bring the Japanese board game Go to a home console, namely the Famicom. The game was designed by Henk Rogers, a Dutch programmer who would play games of Go against the CEO (at the time) of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi. It was during one such game that the prospect of developing such a title for the Famicom was discussed. It was later converted from disk format to cartridge and release in August 1987.

Prior to the release of this game, Nintendo had released a game which was played on the Go board in 1983, known as Gomoku Narabe Renju, but the play mechanics were more akin to "Connect Four" (or five, as it were). The real game of Go is traditionally played on a 19 Ã— 19 grid, but the permutations of possibilities would take too long for the Famicom's processor to consider, so the board size has been significantly reduced to a 9 Ã— 9 grid, which allows for a smoother single player experience. The game also features a lesson mode, in which ninjas appear to teach the player about the rules and strategy of the game.</desc>

		<name>Ishido</name>
		<desc>Ishido is a puzzle board game consisting of a set of 72 stones and a game board of 96 squares.

Every stone has two attributes: a color and a symbol. There are six colors and six symbols in each stone set, thus creating 36 unique stones. Since each stone comes in a pair, there are therefore 72 stones in each stone set.

The primary objective of Ishido is to place all 72 stones onto the board of 96 squares. The challenge arises because stones must be placed adjacent to others that they match, either by color or symbol. When the board begins to fill up, this objective is not so easily accomplished.

A valuable move is the 4-way, in which a stone is placed in the midst of four others, two of which are matched by color, and two which are matched by symbol.

Ishido comes with 6 differently themed stone sets, 5 different game boards, and a variety of Oriental chimes and sound effects.</desc>

Conversely, an arrow pointing up will allow players of the opposite color to jump far higher from the arrow, but will almost entirely eliminate the jumping power of a same-colored character as it pulls them down.</desc>

		<desc>Kaettekita Mario Bros. ("The Return of Mario Bros.") is an updated rerelease of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, which was one of the first games to be ported to the NES console. It adds a few new features to the format, including improved controls for Mario, cutscenes and the ability to save high scores with the Famicom Disk Reader's save function, but is otherwise identical.

The game was part of the Disk Writer system in Japan, where players could write new games over old Famicom disks at special machine vendors found in video game stores and other likely locales. This made the games cheaper to buy (as it minimized production costs) but also made games that were exclusive to this service, such as Kaettekita Mario Bros, harder to find for collectors.

Inexplicably, the game also has a sponsor: Nagatanien, a Japanese producer of seasonings for rice and noodle dishes. Mario had also previously appeared on Nagatanien Japanese TV commercials. This makes Kaettekita Mario Bros. an early example of an advergame.

The European version of Mario Bros., named Mario Bros. Classic, was based off this game rather than the NES original.</desc>

		<desc>Kaettekita Mario Bros. ("The Return of Mario Bros.") is an updated rerelease of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, which was one of the first games to be ported to the NES console. It adds a few new features to the format, including improved controls for Mario, cutscenes and the ability to save high scores with the Famicom Disk Reader's save function, but is otherwise identical.

The game was part of the Disk Writer system in Japan, where players could write new games over old Famicom disks at special machine vendors found in video game stores and other likely locales. This made the games cheaper to buy (as it minimized production costs) but also made games that were exclusive to this service, such as Kaettekita Mario Bros, harder to find for collectors.

Inexplicably, the game also has a sponsor: Nagatanien, a Japanese producer of seasonings for rice and noodle dishes. Mario had also previously appeared on Nagatanien Japanese TV commercials. This makes Kaettekita Mario Bros. an early example of an advergame.

The European version of Mario Bros., named Mario Bros. Classic, was based off this game rather than the NES original.</desc>

		<name>Karate Champ</name>
		<desc>The player assumes the role of a karate competitor and fights against another player or the computer. Using two joysticks, players can execute a number of moves.

Gameplay consists of a two dimensional fight between Karate characters wearing white and red gi, followed by various bonus rounds for the successful player. This pattern repeats itself in the next, more challenging round set against a new background. Unlike most later fighter-type games, there are no health bar or hit points. A hit successfully landed ends the round and earns the player or his opponent either one point or half point (along with a numeric score for the top ten but this has no effect on winning a match per se). The first to score two points is the winner. If the player loses a battle, the game ends. The game also featured some early speech synthesis, in which the judge would call out such phrases as "Fight!" or "Winner!" It's also spoken in Japanese in the Japanese version.</desc>

		<desc>Kick Challenger - Air Foot - Yasai no Kuni no Ashi Senshi  (lit. Kick Challenger: Air Foot: Vegetable Country Foot Soldier) is an action game developed by Vap for the Famicom Disk System and published in 1987. It is a single player game where the player takes control of a tomato as he marches upward through four stages in an effort to rescue his country from insects and other invaders.

You control the tomato by independently directing his two feet, one foot at a time. He make kick in eight directions with whichever foot is not planted in the ground at the given moment. Power ups are revealed by kicking trees, flowers, mushrooms, and other obstacles that are scattered throughout each stage. They may take the form of shoes which grant him the ability move on certain surfaces, or candy which gives him special abilities. Each stage has a "back side" which is accessed by stepping on holes in the ground reveal under kicked obstacles, and provide more power-ups to find.</desc>

		<desc>Patlabor - The Mobile Police - Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo is an action-platformer-shooter game from Bandai and yet another licensed game from the publishing giant. In this case, it is an adaptation of the anime and manga of the same name.

Patlabor is a portmanteau of "patrol" and "labor", with labor being the common name for technologically advanced mechanical walkers used by various construction companies to perform heavy-duty work that a human wouldn't be capable of achieving on their own. Because more and more of these labors are being hijacked by criminals, an equally powerful force of police-issued labors are commissioned and manned by members of the police force. The show follows Section 2 of the Mobile Police Patlabor division in particular.

The game is divided between side-scrolling platformer/run-and-gun levels and first-person shooter modes in which the player character, in their patlabor, must keep the peace by subduing criminals and other villains, some of which have their own labors.</desc>

		<name>Kieta Princess</name>
		<desc>The Kingdom of Rabia's princess goes missing during a visit to Japan, surrounding the investigation of the medicine to an "epidemic dementia," known as "Oninofuguri", and the prevention of its importing. The player takes the role of a detective determined to unravel the mystery of the missing princess Kilala, in this RPG style adventure game. Yasuko Tomita served as the model of one of the characters. Certain telephone numbers would appear, which, if called, would provide the player with a hint, spoken by Yasuko Tomita.

In order to track down Kobayashi, the criminal protagonist, you must visit five different towns and collect information. Neary every house and building can be entered, which was unique for its time. The game also features a high degree of freedom, allowing you to visit restaurants for a bite, or a Dojo to train, or to hunt for vegetation to sell for money, while you are looking for the princess.

Another introduced concept that was novel for its time was the notion of day and night changing the appearance of the city. During the evening, you may encounter a street gang, and they may open fire on you, although you can defend yourself with a revolver. However, if over 20 innocent people are gunned down, you will be arrested and sent to the police station where you must pay a fine and return to the starting point.

The degree of difficult throughout the game is considered quite high, with very few hints to help you out, while other hints are misleading. For example, one hint suggests that you if you sleep over night at a particular crossroad in a city, you will get a key item, but this hint is false. Although you are supposedly a detective, you never actually get to accuse anyone of a crime.</desc>

		<name>Kinnikuman - Kinnikusei Oui Soudatsusen</name>
		<desc>Kinnikuman - Kinnikusei Oui Soudatsusen is a wrestling game based on the popular toy line, manga and anime about a klutzy superhero who fights most of his opponents with professional wrestling moves. The first Kinnikuman game (released as M.U.S.C.L.E. in the US) was a straightforward wrestling game, but this sequel changes the action to a side-scrolling action brawler game with additional RPG and story elements. The main character can still use wrestling moves on enemies, but most of the attacks are simple punches and kicks.Curiously, the boss music is a sped up version of "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly.</desc>

		<name>Knight Lore - Majou No Ookami Otoko</name>
		<desc>Knight Lore is a a 3D isometric adventure game by Jaleco, originally released by the British game company Ultimate. Saberman, the hero of the game, has been cursed by an evil wizard. Every night, he turns into a creepy werewolf and he is on a journey to retrieve all the necessary ingredients to create a magic potion. This potion, he hopes, will get him to return to his human shape. The game starts in a dark forest, somewhere in there the wizard awaits for the potion's ingredients such as diamonds, bottles etc... Our hero's task is to wander around and find them, one at the time, and bring them back to him. But our hero must watch out, he turns into a werewolf at night and the wizard won't hesitate to use his magic against him. Saberman must make sure to always approach him as a human. Up to three items can be carried at the same time, they can also be dropped on the ground and climbed to reach higher platforms. However, once a new ingredient is delivered to the wizard, our hero leaves empty handed and lose all stored items. Series of enemies and hazards are of course scattered along his path, such as spirits, spikes or pits. Once all the ingredients are collected, the game jumps to another location where more objects need to be found with meaner hazards and enemies. This is also the point where the player's progress can be saved.</desc>

		<name>Knight Move</name>
		<desc>The game is based around the concept of how a knight piece is moved in the game of chess. The player controls a knight chess piece that is constantly jumping and must continually choose which of the possible legal moves to make before the knight lands back on the board.

When the knight lands on any square on the board, it turns from white to light teal. Landing there again, turns it dark teal. Landing there yet again destroys the square altogether, leaving a hole that the player must avoid. Falling in a hole will result in a game over. Consecutively creating several holes results in a chain increasing the player's score in differing increments.

At the beginning of each "round", a heart is placed somewhere on the board. A heart (or multiple hearts) must be collected to advance to the next round, which thereby replaces all holes on the board with new white squares and places a new heart somewhere on the board. Depending on the game mode, hearts will sometimes move themselves every few jumps of the knight.

The player can also gather a small amount of extra points, at any time, by holding the A button and speeding up the knight's movement. The main objective in Knight Move is to continue this cycle, despite the increasing game speed, and reach the highest score possible.

The game also includes a simultaneous 2 player versus mode similar to the single player modes.</desc>

		<desc>Blades of Steel, later released in Japan as Konamic Ice Hockey is an ice hockey video game released by Konami for North American arcades in 1987, and ported to the Family Computer Disk System and Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. All teams are fictional but based out of real Canadian and American cities. The game is known for its fast paced hockey action and especially for the fighting. It is a one or two player game. When playing against the computer, there are three difficulty levels to choose from: Junior, College, and Pro (with Pro being the most difficult and Junior being the easiest). Each team consists of three forwards, two defense men, and a goaltender.</desc>

		<desc>Koneko Monogatari: The Adventures of Chatran is a game developed for the Family Computer Disk System in 1986 by Pony Canyon and the NES in 1987. It is actually a movie license title based on the cinema release of Koneko Monogatari, better known in the United States as The Adventures of Milo and The video game representation of this movie is quite different, and regretfully slow. It gives the player control over the kitten Milo, as he attempts to navigate through a side scrolling world of trees, hostile animals, and other obstacles. Milo plods along at a very slow pace, and can jump from tree branch to tree branch, popping fruit out from the leaves, which he must collect before they turn rotten and disappear. Every moving object from mice to beetles, is lethal to Milo and must be avoided. Fruit can be dropped on enemies for extra points. Eggs can be collected to use as weapons which must be dropped on enemies. Bottles of milk grant temporary invincibility. And if the player manages to collect four eggs that spell out the word HELP, Otis will appear to attack enemies that are headed Milo's way. However, touching Otis will also kill Milo..</desc>

		<desc>Link no Bouken - The Legend of Zelda 2 is the second installment in The Legend of Zelda series, published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was originally released in Japan on the Famicom Disk System less than a year after the release of The Legend of Zelda. 

The Adventure of Link is a direct sequel to the original The Legend of Zelda, and again involves the protagonist Link on a quest to save Princess Zelda -- who is not the same Princess from the first game, but another member of the royal family by the same name, who was placed under a sleeping spell a long time ago. The Adventure of Link's emphasis on side-scrolling and RPG-style elements, however, was a significant departure from its predecessor and has given it a reputation as the "black sheep" of the Zelda series. It is arguably the hardest Zelda game. Despite this reputation, the game was highly successful and introduced many elements that would become commonplace in future Zelda games.</desc>

It is arguably the hardest Zelda game. Despite this reputation, the game was highly successful and introduced many elements that would become commonplace in future Zelda games.</desc>

		<desc>The town of Dorl has an infestation of demons who currently reside in the castles dungeon after a portal to the underworld was opened. The emperor of the underworld, Emperor Ruu, commanded his demons to raid the town to steal its treasure and during this ransacking the demons also managed to take Princess Etna's soul away too, leaving her in a comatose state. Many brave adventurers have entered the underground dungeon to try and reclaim her soul from this demon king, but none have returned successfully yet. So now it's up to the player to succeed where others have failed and put an end to the Emperor Ruu and also recover Princess Etna's soul.</desc>

		<name>Magma Project - Hacker</name>
		<desc>Magma Project Hacker is a sci-fi themed RPG and an adaptation of the 1985 PC/Amiga/Atari ST strategy game Hacker. As with the Famicom Disk System adaptation of Monty on the Run, a considerable number of liberties were taken with the game's themes practically transforming it into a completely different game. Ironically, the story more closely resembles another western PC game, Captive, with its plot.
The player character witnesses a murder and is told to seek information on a shadowy organization known as the Magma Project by the dying victim. In order to effectively hunt for clues, the player character uses a device to activate a robot on the other side of the planet and employs the robot's various combat and exploration functions to track down the Magma Project.</desc>

		<desc>Mahjong Kazoku ("Mahjong Family") is a standard Mahjong simulation game for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System. It is a one-on-one version of the game, rather than the standard four-player board game arrangement, and it incorporates many of the various and byzantine scoring rules of the game.
Irem developed and published the game but left a mysterious licensing credit to Ox Inc. on the title screen. It's possible the game is a port of an obscure Japanese Mahjong computer game, or at least borrows some of its coding for the AI opponent or scoring systems.</desc>

In order to accomplish this task, the player cannot simple move across the floor. Rather, the player and all of the enemies hop from one square tile to another, throughout the game. In a majority of stages, the player must uncover the seals which will unlock the door to the next stage by leaping on to the particular tiles which keep the seals concealed. Not every door will take the player forward, however, as some doors are trick doors that may take the player to a previous stage. In some stages, the player must simply survive the onslaught of enemies, while in others, the player is racing against the clock.</desc>

		<desc>Michael English Daibouken (lit: "Michael's English Grand Adventure") is an educational game where the character of Michael, an orange cat, teaches kittens the various letters in the English language as well as some English vocabulary. Michael has to catch floating letters in order to spell out English words, while avoiding the incorrect letters. The game has various different backdrops, including space.

The character of Michael comes from the Japanese serial manga strip "What's Michael", created by Makoto Kobayashi which might be considered analogous to Garfield, due to them both being orange cats. It varies between observing goofy pet behavior to more abstract tales of fantasy with anthropomorphized versions of the animal characters.</desc>

		<desc>Moero TwinBee can be played by up to three player simultaneously: the first two players control TwinBee and WinBee (the ships from the previous game) using the standard Famicom controllers, whereas the third player controls GwinBee (a green ship) by connecting an additional controller into the console's expansion port. Unlike the original TwinBee, which only featured vertical-scrolling stages, Stinger adds side-scrolling stages to the mix as well. There are seven stages in the game. Stage 1, 3, and 7 are side-scrolling stages, while the rest are vertical-scrolling stages. The controls remain the same between the two styles of gameplay, with the only difference being that in the side-scrolling segments, the A button shoots hearts over the ship instead of dropping bombs into the ground like the vertical-scrolling segments, which helps the player keep the power-up bells afloat in the side-scrolling stages.</desc>

		<desc>A Disk Writer only release, The Monitor Puzzle Kinetic Connection - Kineco II is the sequel in which new puzzles are introduced. Like it's prequel the game challenges player to piece together ten images in a jigsaw puzzle like fashion. However, every piece is exactly the same size, and the images on the pieces move. Rather than using the shape of the edges to determine what pieces fit next to one another, you must use the animation on the pieces to determine their arrangement. When each puzzle begins, the pieces are also oriented randomly, so you may be required to flip them vertically or horizontally in order to complete the puzzle. There are 10 different animations, and you can choose between dividing the images into 16, 24, or 48 distinct pieces before attempting to solve the puzzle. Obviously, the fewer pieces, the easier it is to solve.</desc>

		<desc>The game starts out by depositing the pinball in the middle of a simulated pinball table. However, once the ball is shot into one of the holes on the play field, the game enters an elaborate intro sequence which the player can control. The game contains 11 stages, each of which contain a target hole that the player must hit the ball into in order to advance to the next stage. The stages get more elaborate, and more moving obstacles appear to interfere with the behavior of the ball. In addition to controlling the flippers, the control pad can also be used to "nudge" the ball in either direction, although the effectiveness of this varies.</desc>

		<name>Nazo No Kabe - Block Kuzushi</name>
		<desc>In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.

But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.

There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.

Nazo no Kabe - Block Kuzushi  is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.</desc>

		<name>Nazo No Kabe - Block Kuzushi</name>
		<desc>In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.

But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.

There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.

Nazo no Kabe - Block Kuzushi  is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.</desc>

		<desc>In feudal Japan, an evil alien descends upon Murasame castle and takes over a giant statue, which then continues to spread its influence over four neighbouring castles. The samurai apprentice Takamaru is thus summoned to recapture the castles and then take on the alien itself.

Nazo no Murasamejou is a fast-paced action game that has some similarities with The Legend of Zelda, although it is faster and has none of the RPG/Adventure elements. It is also much more linear: You fight through the castles one after the other, with each stage consisting of the path to the castle and the castle itself, where the boss is waiting.

Your have two weapons: (unlimited) shurikens for ranged attacks and a sword for melee combat. The sword is automatically used when you are close enough to an enemy, and it can also be used to deflect enemy shurikens. But since you are constantly under attack by ninjas from all directions and also have only a limited time to finish each stage, the game is still quite hard.</desc>

		<name>19 - Neunzehn</name>
		<desc>The heir to the throne is shared by four brave people: Darius, Simon, Thales, and Sonia. The 19 gods of Olympus left behind an omnipotent stone to the great emperor Achilles, who has ordered a search to be conducted for the stone. You take the role of one of these four in an effort to find the stone on the island before the rest, waging war with opponent armies to prevent them from finding it first.
19 is somewhat unique among turn based strategy games, in that turns are taken in real time, following rules that are reminiscent of the Japanese chess-like game known as Shogi. The game takes place on an overworld map, on which players take turns moving troops. When opposing troops vi for the same location, the game switches to a zoomed-in combat screen, showing each individual member of the opposing forces. While the story of the game revolves around finding a stone, there is no actual stone to discover. Your only goal is to wipe out the armies of the other three opponents.</desc>

		<name>Omoikkiri Tanteidan Haado Gumi - Matenrou No Chousenjou</name>
		<desc>Based upon a Japanese television series that aired in 1987. It features a group of five detective kids on a mission to retrieve various objects stolen by a mysterious thief who wears a golden mask. The group counts the leader Hiroshi, the cute and Aikido expert Yasuko who also happen to be the only girl of the group, Susumu, Satoru and Takeo. The mysterious thief uses many ingenious tricks to escape his pursuers, such as a huge and colorful air-balloon.
Before getting to the main portion of the game, the player must pass the organization's test. After entering personal information such as name, birth-date and blood type, the player must go through two challenges. The first one is a memory test. Eight character faces (from a list of four) appear at random on the screen and the player needs to remember the order in which they came in. The second test is action based and the player must catch roses thrown by the thief, himself hanging from an air-balloon. Once the tests are passed, the real game starts. Our hero can move around town and visit buildings to gather information. He can also use various items such as a slingshot, a metal detector, a radio, binoculars etc. Baddies also wander around the city and must be avoided. They can also be knocked down using any weapon our hero may carry (like the slingshot) or by punching them on the chin.</desc>

		<name>Omoikkiri Tanteidan Haado Gumi - Matenrou No Chousenjou</name>
		<desc>Based upon a Japanese television series that aired in 1987. It features a group of five detective kids on a mission to retrieve various objects stolen by a mysterious thief who wears a golden mask. The group counts the leader Hiroshi, the cute and Aikido expert Yasuko who also happen to be the only girl of the group, Susumu, Satoru and Takeo. The mysterious thief uses many ingenious tricks to escape his pursuers, such as a huge and colorful air-balloon.
Before getting to the main portion of the game, the player must pass the organization's test. After entering personal information such as name, birth-date and blood type, the player must go through two challenges. The first one is a memory test. Eight character faces (from a list of four) appear at random on the screen and the player needs to remember the order in which they came in. The second test is action based and the player must catch roses thrown by the thief, himself hanging from an air-balloon. Once the tests are passed, the real game starts. Our hero can move around town and visit buildings to gather information. He can also use various items such as a slingshot, a metal detector, a radio, binoculars etc. Baddies also wander around the city and must be avoided. They can also be knocked down using any weapon our hero may carry (like the slingshot) or by punching them on the chin.</desc>

		<name>Otocky</name>
		<desc>Otocky can be described as a musical side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The player's spaceship has a ball for a weapon, which can be fired in eight directions; each direction corresponds to a different musical note. The note plays when the player presses the fire button, and is also quantized in time so that it matches the beat playing in the background. By using the weapon selectively the player can improvise music while playing.

Otocky is notable for being one of the first games that include creative/procedural generative music.</desc>

		<name>Pac-man</name>
		<desc>The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots. When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Between some stages one of three intermission animations plays. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, he loses a life. Whenever Pac-Man occupies the same tile as an enemy, he is considered to have collided with that ghost. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. 

Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Pac-Man lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction.</desc>

		<desc>The game is based on standard pachinko rules, replicating the experience of playing pachinko in a parlor. The game board has a layout with nails sticking out. Metal balls would either of or fall in between the holes created by the pegs in order to traverse the board. Certain compartments are added to the board. Should a metal ball find its way to one of these compartments, the player will receive points that are similar to credits on a slot machine.[3] Players can expect to lose that ball (and a point) if it falls below the bottom of the board (similar to falling down a bottomless pit in an action game). Initially, the player starts off with one hundred balls.</desc>

Play will move to the first screen if the ball falls through the bottom of the top screen and will return to the top screen if the ball is hit back through the space at the top of the first screen. The player controls the flippers on either screen to deflect the ball to keep it from falling off the bottom of the lower screen.</desc>

		<name>Pro Golfer Saru - Kage No Tournament</name>
		<desc>Pro Golfer Saru: Kage no Tournament is a golf game with fantasy elements thrown in, developed by Bandai and published on the Family Computer Disk System in 1987. The game is based on a manga (Japanese comic book) known as Pro Golfer Saru published by Fujiko Fujio (also responsible for Doraemon) about a young cave man or neanderthal-like boy who desires to become the greatest golfer in history. To accomplish this goal, he trains in the most desolate of locations, driving golf balls over giant chasms in an effort to hit greens several hundred meters away.

The game is composed of a training mode as well as the tournament challenge. The first nine holes replicate the desolate, and almost prehistoric locations that Saru normally trains in. Balls must be driven over wide spaces in order to stay in bounds and continue play. The back nine holes take place is a more modern, and even slightly futuristic locale, where Saru must sink balls from across rooftops. The game will save one players performance to disk. It was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<desc>Pulsar no Hikari ("Pulsar of Light"): Space Wars Simulation is a game for the FDS created by computer game developer Soft Pro International. It's a rather dense strategic space simulator that has the player control a starship as it explores a galaxy and fights off enemy ships. The player needs to keep an eye on various pieces of information, such as their energy and their destination, and ensure they don't accidentally wander into an area with pulsars or black holes, or off the galaxy map all together.

Exploration in Pulsar no Hikari seems to follow a set course of scanning nearby space, moving into the next region once it's been ascertained with the long-range scanners that there are no insurmountable obstacles to be encountered there, destroy any asteroids or enemy ships that might be prowling around by checking the short-range scanners and then long-range scan/warp to the next area. Once the ship's energy/fuel is low (combat and movement will steadily drain it), the player should return to the closest star base for refuelling. Smaller star bases can refuel the ship's standard energy unit, but damage and lost ammo (the torpedoes, of which the ship has a finite amount) must be recovered at the major bases.

Accidentally warping to a location with a black hole will instantly end the game. It's generally considered a bad idea.</desc>

		<desc>Pulsar no Hikari ("Pulsar of Light"): Space Wars Simulation is a game for the FDS created by computer game developer Soft Pro International. It's a rather dense strategic space simulator that has the player control a starship as it explores a galaxy and fights off enemy ships. The player needs to keep an eye on various pieces of information, such as their energy and their destination, and ensure they don't accidentally wander into an area with pulsars or black holes, or off the galaxy map all together.

		<desc>Putt Putt Golf by Pack-In-Video is one of many golf games for the Famicom and the Famicom Disk System, but one of the few to take players through an abstract world rather than an approximation of a real golf course. The goal of each stage is to reach the hole on the green and pot the ball in as few strokes as possible, but each of the courses are covered with various obstacles - some animated, some stationary. The player must navigate around them (or use them to their advantage, in some cases) in order to achieve the best score.</desc>

		<desc>Radical Bomber!! Jirai-kun FDS is a strategy game developed and published by Jaleco for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. The environment of the game resembles a giant board game where each player moves from one space to another. The goal of Radical Bomber is to carefully think out a plan of action and find a way to trap the opponents by removing connections between each "square" on the map. Successfully isolating an opponent from the rest of the board causes them to forfeit the game. If you manage to isolate every every opponent, Jirai-kun will advance the next level. This game was only released in Japan, and has never been translated from its original Japanese language.</desc>

		<desc>At some point in the early history of earth, the forces of darkness known as HELL were at war with the forces of light known as HEAVEN, and the took this battle to our planet. The HELL forces quickly enslaved human beings, and the earth was cast in darkness and despair. Somewhere on the planet, a fortress was built to harness the power of the sun in order to defeat the forces of HELL, should they ever come to our planet, but it fell into ruin after centuries of neglect. The Shining Princess of HEAVEN was captured and imprisoned on the top floor of this fortress. Also inside are the spirits of the Holy Warriors of Light who have the power to defeat the forces of HELL. However, they are asleep and unable to awaken. Earth's only hope is you, a being who has sacrificed his body in order to inhabit the fallen bodies of the departed. To succeed, you must use each body to obtain the key words which are found in, and used to open, the dungeons of the fortress.</desc>

		<name>Replicart</name>
		<desc>The game takes place at the end of the 21st century. A gigantic snake-like alien called Sonada invades Earth and constructs a base under the soil. Sonada attacks various locations, stealing precious resources, and appears invulnerable to all forms of modern offenses. Engineers regroup and construct a base where a new weapon can be developed. They create the Replicart in the image of Sonada, and give it the power to convert resources into new material that can extend the Replicart and increase its strength until it reaches enough power to destroy the invader.

Replicart is to the original Snake game what Arkanoid is to Breakout; an upgrade that takes the core features of the game and expands upon them by adding enemies, power-ups and more elaborate play settings. In it you must move a robotic snake through mazes in an effort to collect a required number of pieces before the exit will open. The snake's length extends by one unit for every piece collected. If the snake's head touches any of the walls, enemies or its own body, it is destroyed and the player loses one life.

The conversion to the Famicom Disk System by Taito is quite different than the MSX2 original. The number of levels has been reduced to 100, but between every 10 levels, a boss battle occurs in which the player must chase a monster around the screen and blast it until the monster takes enough damage. A bonus level is provided for the player after each boss is defeated before they progress to the next level.</desc>

In the game, you control a protagonist that you name, but the game also stars Risa Tachibana, a popular Japanese singer around the time of the game's release. Together with Risa, your goal is to defeat a witch of darkness by obtaining several key items. Six of Risa's songs are interwoven into the adventure, and the lyrics can provide clues to the proper solution of the game, which is divided into four chapters. At times, a telephone number would appear on the screen, and a telephone service was established for a limited time so that players could call the numbers to get more clues. At times, use of the microphone on the second Famicom controller is required to make progress in the game.</desc>

		<desc>Help Roger Rabbit collect hearts in various levels and save Jessica Rabbit while avoiding the dastardly weasels! This was eventually released in the US as Bugs Bunny's Crazy Castle and changed the hearts to carrots and the weasels into various characters from Looney Tunes. This was due to Kemco losing the rights to Roger Rabbit in the US.

While presented in a side-scroller format, Roger Rabbit differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Roger Rabbit did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Roger avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects.</desc>

		<name>Samurai Sword</name>
		<desc>Samurai Sword is an adventure game developed and published by Capcom for the Famicom Disk System in Japan towards the end of 1988. The player is an unnamed hero who is promptly defeated by the game's antangonist Soron and whisked away before the moment of his demise in order to find a way to counter Soron's considerable magical might.

While the game may resemble an RPG at first, it is actually a traditional Famicom adventure game, similar to Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom. The player can select from a set of commands for the hero to follow such as looking around, talking to NPCs, picking up items and so on. While there are battles, they can only be resolved by finding the right command (often the right spell) rather than the standard RPG method of exchanging blows governed by various statistics.</desc>

		<name>Sd Gundam World - Gachapon Senshi - Scramble Wars</name>
		<desc>SD Gundam World Gachapon Senshi - Scramble Wars is a hybrid strategy/action game based on the popular Gundam toy series from Japan. It was developed and published by Bandai for the Famicom Disk System. Two different versions were released within two months of one another. The initial version was sold in stores for ¥3,300 at the end of 1987 on its own disk with a case. The second version was sold for a much cheaper ¥500 in the beginning of 1988 as part of the "Disk Writer" system, where players could bring their own blank disks to a kiosk and have a game of their choice written to the disk. While both versions contain 10 maps to play on, the Disk Writer edition replaces five of the maps from the original edition with new designs. "Gachapon Senshi" means toy capsule warrior, as the gachapon toy capsule was a popular format for fans of the series to buy super-deformed versions of their favorite Gundam characters.</desc>

		<desc>SD Gundam World Gachapon Senshi - Scramble Wars is a hybrid strategy/action game based on the popular Gundam toy series from Japan. It was developed and published by Bandai for the Famicom Disk System. Two different versions were released within two months of one another. The initial version was sold in stores for ¥3,300 at the end of 1987 on its own disk with a case. The second version was sold for a much cheaper ¥500 in the beginning of 1988 as part of the "Disk Writer" system, where players could bring their own blank disks to a kiosk and have a game of their choice written to the disk. While both versions contain 10 maps to play on, the Disk Writer edition replaces five of the maps from the original edition with new designs. "Gachapon Senshi" means toy capsule warrior, as the gachapon toy capsule was a popular format for fans of the series to buy super-deformed versions of their favorite Gundam characters.</desc>

While the game is considered memorable, especially for being the first in a long line of SD Gundam World games to come, the single-player experience is known for having considerable flaws and a high level of difficulty. While one could forgive the long load times common among the Famicom Disk System games, it was much harder to overlook the exaggeratedly long periods of time that the computer AI took to plan out its moves. This could range from thirty seconds to a several minutes just for one of the three possible commands. Additionally, entering into combat against the computer was a difficult challenge, as the computer opponent played with lightning fast reactions that human players could not compete with without an exceptional amount of practice. It was, however, possible to trick the computer into trapping itself against obstacles on the right maps.</desc>

		<desc>An enemy space fortress of the Balangool Empire is approaching Earth. Captain Commando has to infiltrate it and find his way to Section-Z to destroy L-Brain, the computer controlling the fortress.
Secton-Z is a side-scrolling game in which the player is a space soldier who can land on the ground and other platform structures and run along them. It is one of the first games which gives players the ability to not only shoot forward, but backwards. It is also one of the first games to give players a choice of paths at the end of each level. Depending on which path they took, they could get special weapons or bombs which wouldn't show up if the other path was taken. To compensate for this, the path without the weapon is often easier. They can activate these special weapons by pressing Select.
Sometimes, one of the paths will be flashing red instead of the usual yellow. This indicates that it is impassable unless the player locates and destroys the Generator Boss that is creating the field. Therefore, it is imperative to find the right paths through the fortress to get to the Generator and blow it up. Once this is done, it is possible to safely pass through the red gates and move onto the rest of the area, and eventually, the area boss. Each time a generator is destroyed the player will earn a capsule that increases total HP.</desc>

It is part of the Wave Jack series of games produced by Imagineer that come with more accessories than the average video game, including a story book and audio cassette tape.
Seiken Psycho Calibur is, in many ways, an attempt to copy the success of The Legend of Zelda. However, it fails to inspire the same level of wonder and fascination. It also lacks a good degree of polish that made the afore mentioned title so great. Nevertheless, Seiken Psycho Calibur is a relatively fun game to play, as long as you have a fair degree of insight into how the game is played. There are some unintuitive aspects of the game that can make progress in the game quite difficult.
For example, you begin the game in a town which offers a variety of goods for sale, but you only receive so much money, and you can never return to the town once you leave. Therefore, what you decide to invest your money in has a substantial impact on the difficulty of the game early on. Many items can be bought for less money later on, but only if you know the location of the hidden shops that contain them. Other less obvious points in the game require a bit of back tracking from later areas to earlier areas in order to acquire items that allow you to proceed, and boss battles that are at times incredibly difficult.</desc>

		<name>Sexy Yakyuuken Adventure 2 - Gal's Dungeon Part 2</name>
		<desc>Gal's Dungeon is an adult unlicensed Famicom Disk System game by Super Pig/Hacker International.You play as private eye Kogorou Kurachi, tasked with rescuing the daughter of a crime syndicate boss from the mysterious "Phantom of 40 Faces". It's a 3D dungeon game, similar to the mazes in Wizardry and other terrible computer RPGs, where you progress through eight floors of the villain's master hideout to the thrilling final showdown!
Each floor has a female guardian, whom you must play rock-paper-scissors against. If you win, you get the key to the next floor. You can pick up maps and compasses to guide your way, but always be wary for hidden traps and secret clues!
Kogorou Kurachi is the designers' little parody of the Japanese fictional detective Kogoro Akechi, often considered the Japanese counterpart to Sherlock Holmes. His most frequent nemesis was the master criminal, the Fiend with Twenty Faces. So there's some history for you.</desc>

		<name>Sexy Yakyuuken Adventure 2 - Gal's Dungeon Part 2</name>
		<desc>Gal's Dungeon is an adult unlicensed Famicom Disk System game by Super Pig/Hacker International.You play as private eye Kogorou Kurachi, tasked with rescuing the daughter of a crime syndicate boss from the mysterious "Phantom of 40 Faces". It's a 3D dungeon game, similar to the mazes in Wizardry and other terrible computer RPGs, where you progress through eight floors of the villain's master hideout to the thrilling final showdown!
Each floor has a female guardian, whom you must play rock-paper-scissors against. If you win, you get the key to the next floor. You can pick up maps and compasses to guide your way, but always be wary for hidden traps and secret clues!
Kogorou Kurachi is the designers' little parody of the Japanese fictional detective Kogoro Akechi, often considered the Japanese counterpart to Sherlock Holmes. His most frequent nemesis was the master criminal, the Fiend with Twenty Faces. So there's some history for you.</desc>

		<name>Silviana - Ai Ippai No Little Angel</name>
		<desc>Sylviana lived with her mom in relative peace after her father passed away. One day, her mom came down with a mysterious illness. Despite everything Sylviana tried, her mother's condition only got worse. Then one day, she heard a rumor about a Dr. Doppler, who can create a medicine that will cure any disease. She decides to head out and find this Dr. Doppler, and convince him to give her the medicine. However, she soon finds out that the doctor is unable to help her, due to having had his eight treasures stolen from him by demons. Sylviana vows to return the treasures to him in exchange for the medicine.
The game borrows it's combat system from games like Hydlide and Ys: Ancient Ys Vanished, where damage is inflicted upon (and exchanged with) enemies by crashing into them. However, there are no levels or experience points, so Sylviana's power only grows by virtue of the improved equipment that she purchases or finds. Throughout the game, the player wanders around a world map in order to find towns where goods may be purchased, and caves or towers which must be explored to find treasure. Eventually, the player enters a cave and steps through a mirror to enter the mirror image of the original world map, with increased difficulty.</desc>

		<name>Smash Ping Pong</name>
		<desc>Smash Ping Pong simulates the game of ping-pong or table tennis in a remarkably different manner than prior simulations of any variety of tennis. Rather than putting the emphasis on precise control and placement of the paddle in order to return the ball, the emphasis is on timing and strategic control of the ball's speed and trajectory. The player sees no other on-screen representation of themselves beyond a hand holding a paddle. The hand and the paddle automatically move left and right to match the horizontal position of the ball. Players need only concern themselves with the timing of their paddle swing, and the style of swing to use. Players can choose between three different swings, along with the choice of forehand or backhand. 

The Famicom Disk System conversion was developed by Konami, and published directly by Nintendo as Smash Ping Pong. As a result,Konami's penguin mascot Pentarou was replaced by Diskun, the Famicom Disk System mascot, on the title screen, and Donkey Kong Jr. appears in the stands on the right side. The conversion offers several variations of play, including one or two player games, plays to 11 or 21 points, and five levels of difficulty. Additionally, Deuce win conditions do not end at 15 points, but can climb as high as 99 points.</desc>

		<desc>The main character, named Dana, is sent to retrieve "Solomon's Key" to restore the world to light from demons that were accidentally released. The object of the game is to advance through the 50 rooms of "Constellation Space" by acquiring a key to the door that leads to the next room before a timer runs out. The game incorporates elements of the platform shooter genre. Dana can run, jump, create or destroy orange blocks adjacent to him as well as create fireballs to destroy demons. The orange blocks can also be destroyed by hitting them with the character's head twice. Along the way Dana can acquire items to upgrade his firepower and extra lives as well as items that award bonus points and unlock hidden rooms. With certain items, Dana must make, then break blocks (sometimes in a certain manner) to make these appear.</desc>

Super Boy Allan is the second game in Sunsoft's "Intelligence Game" edutainment series for the Famicom Disk System, featuring two different game modes.

The first game mode, which is also the main game, the player has to avoid contact with enemies and push logs in order to solve math-based problems to get extra items. Solving math problems also increases your ability to move several logs at once, which is needed to make further progress.

The second, and much simpler game mode, has the player to finish a 39-steps marathon run by correctly answering simple math questions to accumulate as many points as possible.</desc>

The first game mode, which is also the main game, the player has to avoid contact with enemies and push logs in order to solve math-based problems to get extra items. Solving math problems also increases your ability to move several logs at once, which is needed to make further progress.

The second, and much simpler game mode, has the player to finish a 39-steps marathon run by correctly answering simple math questions to accumulate as many points as possible.</desc>

		<name>Super Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>Douglas E. Smith's Lode Runner was introduced to Japan in 1983 on various popular Japanese home computer platforms, including the MSX, Sharp X1, and NEC PC family computers. Hudson Soft licensed the rights to bring the game to Nintendo's Famicom, and it was released in 1984 as one of the first 3rd party games ever made for the system and it was an incredible hit. Around the same time, Irem licensed the rights to produce an arcade version of Lode Runner which they also released in 1984, along with three other sequels through 1986. These arcade versions made a few tweaks to the original game play, and the final arcade game introduced a two player cooperative mode.

In 1987, Irem decided to package a number of select stages from all four of the arcade games into one title, and released it in disk format for the Famicom Disk System, entitled Super Lode Runner. Though the graphics were not quite as good as the arcade games, they were close, and Irem brought many of the game play changes to Famicom players, including the new two player mode. Irem released a sequel later on that same year. A different version of the game was released for the MSX with the same title.</desc>

		<desc>The second compilation of levels from Irem's Lode Runner Arcade series. Developed for the Famicom Disk System, it was never released outside of Japan.
Irem created four Arcade versions of the original Lode Runner, each with a unique set of levels as well as added features like a co-operative mode for two players. For the FDS home versions, Irem compiled several levels from each of these Arcade versions onto one disk. Super Lode Runner II has fewer single-player levels than its predecessor, but contains more co-op levels to make up for it.</desc>

		<desc>Originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros.® 2, this game has previously made only brief cameo appearances in the Western hemisphere. Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if that?s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game?s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just don?t be surprised if she?s in another castle!</desc>

		<desc>Originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros.® 2, this game has previously made only brief cameo appearances in the Western hemisphere. Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if that?s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game?s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just don?t be surprised if she?s in another castle!</desc>

		<desc>Originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros.® 2, this game has previously made only brief cameo appearances in the Western hemisphere. Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if that?s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game?s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just don?t be surprised if she?s in another castle!</desc>

		<name>Tama And Friends - 3 Choume Daibouken</name>
		<desc>The game is based on a manga and anime for children of the same name that concerns the cats and dogs of a close-knit neighborhood. 



The game has a subtitle: 3 Choume Daibouken. The "3 Choume" part refers to the district in which Tama and his friends live, while "Daibouken" simply means "great adventure".



As a game, Tama and Friends is very basic, and quite clearly meant for very young children. The goal is to simply walk right across a suburban environment while avoiding enemies like birds and random flying junk. Tama can also climb telegraph poles to help him get higher, which occasionally lead to bonus areas, and there are also bosses to be fought at the end of certain stages.</desc>

		<desc>Tantei Jinguuji Saburou - Kiken na Futari - Zenpen  (Detective Saburou Jinguuji: Danger For Two, Part 1) is a mystery-adventure game developed by Data East for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. It is the third game of the long standing Tantei Jinguuji Saburou series, following Tantei Jinguuji Saburou: Yokohama-kou Renzoku Satsujin Jiken. In the third mystery, the detective visits a race circuit at the invitation of one of Yulia's friends. A motorcycle racer, Sabin Olsen, crashes at the circuit, but a different racer's body is recovered from the crash site. At the same time, Sabin Olsen, at a hotel, is found where a man he was supposed to meet was killed causing Olsen to be framed as he fled the hotel. Due to memory constraints on the size of the disks, this game was broken up into two parts. This is the first part, while the second part, Tantei Jinguuji Saburo: Kiken na Futari Kouhen, was release a few months later.</desc>

		<desc>Tantei Jinguuji Saburou - Shinjuku Chuuou Kouen Satsujin Jiken  ("Detective Saburo Jinguuji: Shinjuku Central Park Murder Mystery") is the first in a long-running series of crime-themed adventure games from Data East regarding the detective Saburo Jinguuji, or Jake Hunter as he is known in the West.

As with all the games that follow, the goal of the game is to discover the perpetrator behind a murder by talking to witnesses and suspects, gathering clues and deducing facts about the case. The player can use a menu of options with which to control Detective Jinguuji's investigation, such as "Talk" and "Look" commands to get a better sense of the world of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Tarot Uranai (Lit. Tarot fortune telling) is a fortune telling simulation developed and published by Scorpion Soft for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. During play, the game predicts the player's future in several areas, including love, finance, and education. It followed a series of other astrological "utility" programs for the platform, including Chuugoku Senseijutsu and '89 Dennou Kyuusei Uranai.

The game focuses on the Tarot deck and their supposed clairvoyant properties. The game will randomly shuffle a deck and lay them out in a formation of the player's choosing - each formation is meant to predict a different aspect of the player's life. The game will then reveal cards that the player chooses and decipher the meaning behind them.</desc>

		<desc>Titanic Mystery (lit. Titanic Mystery: Shiver of Blue) is an underwater exploration game developed by Activision and published by Gakken in 1987 for the Family Computer Disk System. It has a female protagonist that the player controls while searching sunken ships.

The game is slightly famous for its instruction booklet which contains a short manga-style story. Despite the fact that most Famicom users at this time were children, this manga story features the protagonist in a shower scene. The game was never released outside of Japan, nor was it ever translated from Japanese.</desc>

		<desc>Tobidase Daisakusen was developed by Square in 1987 and was published by DOG, a now-defunct label of Square. The North American release, which was the first Square game to reach American shores, was published by Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. for the NES under the name The 3-D Worldrunner.

The gameplay can best be described as an attempt to merge Super Mario Bros. game mechanics with Space Harrier's third person perspective. In the game, the player assumes the role of Jack, a wild "space cowboy" on a mission to save various planets overrun by serpent-like beasts. The game takes place in Solar System #517, which is being overrun by a race of aliens known as Serpentbeasts, who are led by the evil Grax. As WorldRunner, the player must battle through eight planets to destroy Grax. For its time, the game was technically advanced; the game's three dimensional scrolling effect is very similar to the linescroll effects used by Pole Position and many racing games of the day.

Part of the appeal and selling point of 3-D WorldRunner was its "3-D mode," and it was the first of three games by Square to feature such an option (the other two being JJ, the sequel to 3-D WorldRunner, and Rad Racer). When the 3-D mode is selected, the game uses computer image processing techniques to combine images from two slightly different viewpoints into a single image, known as anaglyph images. The game was packaged with cardboard "anaglyph glasses," which use red and cyan color filters to moderate the light reaching each eye to create the illusion of a three dimensional image.

Tobidase Daisakusen was designed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, Nobuo Uematsu, and Nasir Gebelli, all whom would later rise to fame as core members of the team behind the popular RPG Final Fantasy. The three also developed JJ - Tobidase Daisakusen Part II, the sequel to 3-D WorldRunner.</desc>

Part of the appeal and selling point of 3-D WorldRunner was its "3-D mode," and it was the first of three games by Square to feature such an option (the other two being JJ, the sequel to 3-D WorldRunner, and Rad Racer). When the 3-D mode is selected, the game uses computer image processing techniques to combine images from two slightly different viewpoints into a single image, known as anaglyph images. The game was packaged with cardboard "anaglyph glasses," which use red and cyan color filters to moderate the light reaching each eye to create the illusion of a three dimensional image.

Tobidase Daisakusen was designed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, Nobuo Uematsu, and Nasir Gebelli, all whom would later rise to fame as core members of the team behind the popular RPG Final Fantasy. The three also developed JJ - Tobidase Daisakusen Part II, the sequel to 3-D WorldRunner.</desc>

		<desc>Tobidase Daisakusen was developed by Square in 1987 and was published by DOG, a now-defunct label of Square. The North American release, which was the first Square game to reach American shores, was published by Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. for the NES under the name The 3-D Worldrunner.

The gameplay can best be described as an attempt to merge Super Mario Bros. game mechanics with Space Harrier's third person perspective. In the game, the player assumes the role of Jack, a wild "space cowboy" on a mission to save various planets overrun by serpent-like beasts. The game takes place in Solar System #517, which is being overrun by a race of aliens known as Serpentbeasts, who are led by the evil Grax. As WorldRunner, the player must battle through eight planets to destroy Grax. For its time, the game was technically advanced; the game's three dimensional scrolling effect is very similar to the linescroll effects used by Pole Position and many racing games of the day.

		<name>Tooyama No Kinsan Space Chou - Mr. Gold</name>
		<desc>Tooyama no Kinsan Space Chou - Mr. Gold is a graphical text adventure game developed by Toei Animation for the Famicom Disk System, and published in Japan in 1988. The game is based on an anime OVA "Tooyama Sakura Uchuu Chou - Yatsu no Na wa Gold" (or simply Samurai Gold) which in turn is loosely based on real-life samurai Tooyama Kagemoto. Mr. Gold is a sci-fi adventure about a hero with a cherry blossom tattoo who fights crimes across the cosmos. This character archetype is usually contributed to fictional adaptations of the Tooyama Kagemoto legend, though rarely with a Ziggy Stardust sci-fi theme.The game plays much like any other NES text adventure: The player is presented with a window of what the main character can see and is given options in various menus for what the player can do at any given moment, such as pick up nearby objects or talk to nearby people. Much of the game is spent following co-ordinates to different locations and discovering where to go next.</desc>

		<name>Topple Zip</name>
		<desc>Topple Zip is a vertically scrolling shooter that is also labeled as a race game. The player pilots an air craft and flies in competition against several computer controlled craft. In addition to firing upon your opponents, you may ram into them (and they may ram into you) and dislodge a power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect. There are eight distinct scenes, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other scenes. How the scenes connect is random on each play through. The goal is to locate the key which is necessary to access to warp which leads to the eight and final scene, collect it from whichever scene it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth scene before any other competitor.</desc>

		<desc>TwinBee can be played by up to 2-players simultaneously. The player takes control of a cartoon-like anthropomorphic spacecraft, with Player 1 taking control of TwinBee, the titular ship, while Player 2 controls WinBee. The game controls consists of a joystick and two buttons: one for shooting enemies in the air and the other for dropping bombs to ground enemies (similarly to Xevious).

The player's primary power-ups are bells that can be uncovered by shooting at the floating clouds where they're hidden. If the player continues shooting the bell after it appears, it will change into one of four other colors: the regular yellow bells only grant bonus points, the white bell will upgrade the player's gun into a twin cannon, the blue bell increases the player's speed (for up to five speed levels), the green bell will allow the player to create image copies of its ship for additional firepower, and the red bell will provide the player's ship a barrier that allows it to sustain more damage. The green and red bells cannot be combined together. Other power-ups can also be retrieved from ground enemies such as an alternate bell that gives the player's ship a three-way gun, a star which eliminates all on-screen enemies.

As with other games of the same genre, getting shot by a single enemy bullet will cause the player to lose a life. However, if the bullet only strikes either side of the ship instead, the player's ship will only lose one of its arms. If the player's ship loses both arms, it will lose the ability to throw bombs and the player must wait for an ambulance to arrive. The player must navigate their ship to the ambulance to repair their arms. However, if the player's ship loses both arms for the second time, no ambulance will arrive.

If two players are playing at the same time, they can align their ships vertically or horizontally together to perform more powerful attacks</desc>

		<name>Ultraman - Kaijuu Teikoku No Gyakushuu</name>
		<desc>Ultraman: Kaiju Teikoku no Gyakushu, loosely translated as "Ultraman: Counterattack of the Monster Empire" is a side scrolling platformer developed for the Family Computer Disk System and published by Bandai at the start of 1987. This game is the first Famicom game dealing with Ultraman. Ultraman 2 was a sequel developed as a simulation game, and Ultraman Club: Chikyuu Dakkan Sakusen was developed as an RPG utilizing the "chibi" or super-deformed style of artwork for the characters.

The player controls Hayate, a member of the Science Special Search Party, which protects the earth from invasions of large hostile aliens. He must run across each stage, defeating enemies with his ray gun. He must also collect energy orbs to fill a meter on the screen. When it is full, he can transform himself into the powerful Ultraman. Energy balls can appear under a variety of circumstance, such as beating an enemy or shooting points in space. Just like in the show, you can only be Ultraman for 3 minutes, and you can chop or kick the boss monsters. When only one minute remains, Ultraman will gain access to two secret powers, the Specium Ray, and the Cutting Halo. Once the boss monster is defeated, the stage is cleared.

If all 11 stages are cleared and the player continues, the game will change the character to Dan Moroboshi who can transform into Ultra Seven. Although Ultra Seven's capabilities are the same as Ultraman's, the defensive power of the enemies will be higher. There are two versions of this game, one which was distributed on disk, and one which was distributed through disk writing stations (made available on March 26, 1987) and they feature slightly different background music tunes.</desc>

When it is full, he can transform himself into the powerful Ultraman. Energy balls can appear under a variety of circumstance, such as beating an enemy or shooting points in space. Just like in the show, you can only be Ultraman for 3 minutes, and you can chop or kick the boss monsters. When only one minute remains, Ultraman will gain access to two secret powers, the Specium Ray, and the Cutting Halo. Once the boss monster is defeated, the stage is cleared.

If all 11 stages are cleared and the player continues, the game will change the character to Dan Moroboshi who can transform into Ultra Seven. Although Ultra Seven's capabilities are the same as Ultraman's, the defensive power of the enemies will be higher. There are two versions of this game, one which was distributed on disk, and one which was distributed through disk writing stations (made available on March 26, 1987) and they feature slightly different background music tunes.</desc>

		<desc>Ultraman 2: Shutsugeki Katoku Tai!! (Loosely translated as Ultraman 2: Sortie Department Group) is an action game developed by Bandai for the Famicom Disk System and published at the end of 1987. As the title implies, it revolves around the Ultraman series that was popular in Japan. However, rather than making Ultraman the focus of this game, it is the defense support team that goes into action whenever Japan is attacked by a giant monster which gets the majority of the game time.

The game takes place in modern Japan, with a bird's eye view presentation of much of Japan's metropolis. Players must send a team out to search for, and obtain, a cube which permits the defense team to damage monsters when they appear. Once the cube is found, monsters begin to appear and attack the buildings of Japan. The team must deploy vehicles to help aid in the destruction of these monsters until they have all been defeated. If a monster destroys a critical building, the game is instantly over.</desc>

		<desc>The game enables the player to choose the amount of people on their team, their country and their gender. The countries include the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Cuba, Russia (USR), and Tunisia. 

In the game the player will control their players by using the d-pad, and will use the b button to perform the game's various actions. The a button is not used in Volleyball. On the court there are two rows, 1 and 2. When the ball nears one of the rows, the team members in that row will then be able to be controlled by the player. If you are unable to hit the ball over the net, then the opposing team receives one point. After hitting the ball to the other side, the other team may or may not hit it over. If they don't your team receives one point.

To serve, the player must press the b button, wait for the ball to come back down to them and then press the b button again. When the opposing team serves, you will have to quickly hit it back over. Occasionally when you simply hit the ball, it'll go straight up in the air. If this happens, you'll have to press the b button once more in order to hit it over.</desc>

		<desc>Vs. Excitebike is a motorcross racing simulation game developed by Nintendo as a sequel to Excitebike for the Famicom Disk System. It was also released in the arcades but the Famicom Disk System is arguably better with additional features.  It comes with some improved features, including a simultaneous two player mode that the original game lacked, and an improved track save system (the tracks were saved to the writable portion of the disk). The music is completely different; none of the songs from the original game are present in this version, and a background theme is played during gameplay. There is also a new bonus round that has you jumping over trucks.</desc>

		<name>Wakusei Aton Gaiden</name>
		<desc>Wakusei Aton Gaiden ("Planet Aton Side-Story") is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up that was created by the Japanese National Tax Agency (Kokuzeichou) in order to teach children and older players about the issues surrounding Japan's bubble economy by way of a sci-fi themed parable. The story concerns the eponymous planet Aton and two young pilots who attempt to save it from some sort of economy-based crisis - one that just so happens to manifests itself as an alien invasion. The game can be played by one or two players, with player one assuming the role of the male pilot Kanta while the second player assumes the role of the female pilot Yuki.

The game was made accessible to players via a system not unlike the Disk Writer service, though presumably as a government-funded game it was made freely available. It is thought that copies were given away at some manner of a Japanese tax awareness convention or from an educational group that went to various schools across the country to lecture students. As with many Disk Writer exclusive games, it is extremely difficult for modern day Famicom collectors to find.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls Mario (or Luigi in two-player mode) and attempts to destroy all of a certain set of objects with a large hammer on each of 100 levels. Mario cannot jump because of the hammer's weight. The player can select any level to start on from the title screen. Each level takes place on a playfield divided into an invisible grid, each space of which can contain one object. Objects include destructible walls, pillars, and ladders, indestructible barrels and ladders, bombs that destroy all connected destructible objects, and various enemies that Mario must avoid. Doors may also exist, which can be opened to cause enemies to move harmlessly into the background. The game also introduced a new character, a construction foreman named Spike (believed to be an early version of Wario), who chases Mario and attempts to disrupt him by knocking down objects and causing him to fall to the bottom of the playfield. The player starts the game with five lives and loses a life whenever Mario comes in contact with an enemy or fireball. The game is over when all lives are lost. The game can also be aborted at any time, and must be aborted if Mario becomes trapped in a barrel.</desc>

		<desc>Xevious tells the story of the fight between humankind and the biocomputer GAMP, which controls the alien forces of planet Xevious. It turns out that the Xevious inhabitants are originally from Earth, and GAMP (General Artificial Matrix Producer) is the product of an ancient civilization that prospered on earth a hundred thousand years ago. During this golden age, the Gamps were human clones used in heavy labor, until they rebelled to their own creators. In order to survive the upcoming Ice Age, they planned to leave earth and migrate in search of a new homeland. They finally selected seven planets that were likely suitable to human life.</desc>

		<name>Sexy Yakyuuken Adventure 2 - Gal's Dungeon Part 2</name>
		<desc>Gal's Dungeon is an adult unlicensed Famicom Disk System game by Super Pig/Hacker International.You play as private eye Kogorou Kurachi, tasked with rescuing the daughter of a crime syndicate boss from the mysterious "Phantom of 40 Faces". It's a 3D dungeon game, similar to the mazes in Wizardry and other terrible computer RPGs, where you progress through eight floors of the villain's master hideout to the thrilling final showdown!
Each floor has a female guardian, whom you must play rock-paper-scissors against. If you win, you get the key to the next floor. You can pick up maps and compasses to guide your way, but always be wary for hidden traps and secret clues!
Kogorou Kurachi is the designers' little parody of the Japanese fictional detective Kogoro Akechi, often considered the Japanese counterpart to Sherlock Holmes. His most frequent nemesis was the master criminal, the Fiend with Twenty Faces. So there's some history for you.</desc>

		<name>Yume Koujou Doki Doki Panic</name>
		<desc>Yume Koujou Doki Doki Panic  (translated as "Dream Factory: Heart-Pounding Panic") is a Japan-only video game developed by Nintendo in cooperation with Fuji Television for the Family Computer Disk System to promote its event called Yume Koujou '87 (translates to Dream Factory '87).

It was later released outside of Japan in an altered format under the name Super Mario Bros. 2, since the original Japanese Super Mario Bros. sequel, Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, was deemed too similar to the original and too difficult for overseas players. Eventually, the altered Mario version of Doki Doki Panic was released in Japan as well, under the title Super Mario USA. 

The story starts with two chidren, the young twins Piki and Poki, peacefully reading a story book. However, they accidentally tear off the last page of the book - little did they know that the book is actually magic! The evil Mamu suddenly appears, and his huge three-fingered hand pulls them into a quirky dream world. 

The goal of Doki Doki Panic is to help the whole family (namely Imajin, Lina and their parents Mama and Papa) rescue their poor children kidnaped by the evil king lizard. Each member has its own strengths and weaknesses - Imaji is a balanced character whereas Lina is fairly light weight and can effortlessly hover and fly over short distances, but she is really slow at picking up items. Papa is the strongest of the group and can throw enemies and items really far, whereas Mama can jump higher than anyone. As aforementioned, each character can carry enemies, items, and especially radishes and other vegetables that can be pulled out of the ground and used as lethal weapons. The game features a myriad of other items, such as bombs (self explanatory), Power blocks (similar to Mario Bros's POW blocks that kill all enemies on screen), Stars (temporary invincibility), keys (to unlock doors), Hearts (extra health) or the mysterious magic lamps that open doors to the Dark World - mirror areas where our heroes can find special items or heart containers. 

Doki Doki Panic follows a story book structure, and is made out of seven chapters (areas) and twenty pages (levels). Interestingly, although the player can play the Doki Doki Panic with any character, it has to eventually defeat the evil Mamu with all four to finally beat the game (the player can separately save each character's progress).</desc>

		<desc>Yume Koujou Doki Doki Panic  (translated as "Dream Factory: Heart-Pounding Panic") is a Japan-only video game developed by Nintendo in cooperation with Fuji Television for the Family Computer Disk System to promote its event called Yume Koujou '87 (translates to Dream Factory '87).

It was later released outside of Japan in an altered format under the name Super Mario Bros. 2, since the original Japanese Super Mario Bros. sequel, Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, was deemed too similar to the original and too difficult for overseas players. Eventually, the altered Mario version of Doki Doki Panic was released in Japan as well, under the title Super Mario USA. 

The story starts with two chidren, the young twins Piki and Poki, peacefully reading a story book. However, they accidentally tear off the last page of the book - little did they know that the book is actually magic! The evil Mamu suddenly appears, and his huge three-fingered hand pulls them into a quirky dream world. 

The goal of Doki Doki Panic is to help the whole family (namely Imajin, Lina and their parents Mama and Papa) rescue their poor children kidnaped by the evil king lizard. Each member has its own strengths and weaknesses - Imaji is a balanced character whereas Lina is fairly light weight and can effortlessly hover and fly over short distances, but she is really slow at picking up items. Papa is the strongest of the group and can throw enemies and items really far, whereas Mama can jump higher than anyone. As aforementioned, each character can carry enemies, items, and especially radishes and other vegetables that can be pulled out of the ground and used as lethal weapons. The game features a myriad of other items, such as bombs (self explanatory), Power blocks (similar to Mario Bros's POW blocks that kill all enemies on screen), Stars (temporary invincibility), keys (to unlock doors), Hearts (extra health) or the mysterious magic lamps that open doors to the Dark World - mirror areas where our heroes can find special items or heart containers. 

Doki Doki Panic follows a story book structure, and is made out of seven chapters (areas) and twenty pages (levels). Interestingly, although the player can play the Doki Doki Panic with any character, it has to eventually defeat the evil Mamu with all four to finally beat the game (the player can separately save each character's progress).</desc>

		<desc>Yuu Maze ("Maze Play") is a single-screen maze game akin to Namco's classic Pac-Man and its many other imitators in that the goal of the game is to drive the futuristic vehicle around a maze collecting dots while avoiding (or temporarily eliminating) the enemies. Taito, one of the largest manufacturers of Arcade games at the time (not to mention the creators of Space Invaders), would produce similarly Arcade-reminiscent games for the system in order to tap into the portion of the market nostalgic for classic Arcade experiences.Yuu Maze adds a few innovations to the format: Each maze has a different structure, different enemies and different lay-outs for the pellets that are required to complete the level; the player can find power-ups which grant weapons, shields and speed-ups to their vehicle. The player's vehicle also has some degree of inertia: There's a slight delay when attempting to accelerate after stopping or performing a U-turn, but if the player keeps moving and changes direction only at 90 degree intervals, they can keep moving at their maximum speed. This is often necessary to keep ahead of the fast moving enemies.</desc>

		<desc>In Zanac, the player controls the spaceship AFX-6502 Zanac as it flies through various planets, space stations, and outer space and through an armada of enemies comprising the defenses of the game's main antagonist?the "System." The player must fight through twelve levels and destroy the System and its defenses. The objective is to shoot down enemies and projectiles and accumulate points. Players start with three lives, and they lose a life if they get hit by an enemy or projectile. After losing a life, gameplay continues with the player reappearing on the screen and losing all previously accumulated power-ups; the player remains temporarily invincible for a moment upon reappearing on the screen. The game ends when all the player's lives have been lost or after completing the twelfth and final area. However, the player can earn 1-ups (extra lives) throughout the game by accumulating high point scores. Zanac has a continue option which allows players to restart the game from the level in which they lost all their lives.</desc>

		<name>Zelda No Densetsu - The Hyrule Fantasy</name>
		<desc>A small kingdom in the land of Hyrule, the setting of the game, is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded it and stole the Triforce of Power, a part of a magical artifact bestowing great strength. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, another of the pieces, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is eventually kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, though a young boy named Link appears and rescues her.  After hearing Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda incorporates elements of action, adventure, and role-playing games. The player controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels in the overworld, a large outdoor map with varied environments. Link begins the game armed only with a small shield, but a sword becomes available to Link after he ventures into a cave that is accessible from the game's first map screen. Throughout the game, various characters aid Link by giving or selling equipment and clues. These people can be found in caves scattered throughout the overworld; some are readily accessible, while others are hidden behind obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls

Nintendo originally released the game as the launch title for the Family Computer's new Disk System peripheral. The Legend of Zelda was joined by a re-release of Super Mario Bros., Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Soccer, and Mahjong in its introduction of the Disk System. It made full use of the Disk Card media's advantages over traditional ROM cartridges with a disk size of 128 kilobytes, which was expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of space on the disk, however, it was only in katakana. Rather than passwords, it used rewritable disks to save the game. It used the extra sound channel provided by the Disk System for certain sound effects; most notable are the sounds of Link's sword when his health is full, the roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and enemy death sounds. The sound effects used the Famicom's PCM channel in the cartridge version. It also used the microphone built into the Famicom's controller that was not included in the NES. This led to confusion in the U.S. as the instruction manual reads that Pols Voice, a rabbit-like enemy in the game, "hates loud noise".

		<desc>A small kingdom in the land of Hyrule, the setting of the game, is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded it and stole the Triforce of Power, a part of a magical artifact bestowing great strength. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, another of the pieces, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is eventually kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, though a young boy named Link appears and rescues her.  After hearing Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda incorporates elements of action, adventure, and role-playing games. The player controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels in the overworld, a large outdoor map with varied environments. Link begins the game armed only with a small shield, but a sword becomes available to Link after he ventures into a cave that is accessible from the game's first map screen. Throughout the game, various characters aid Link by giving or selling equipment and clues. These people can be found in caves scattered throughout the overworld; some are readily accessible, while others are hidden behind obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls

Nintendo originally released the game as the launch title for the Family Computer's new Disk System peripheral. The Legend of Zelda was joined by a re-release of Super Mario Bros., Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Soccer, and Mahjong in its introduction of the Disk System. It made full use of the Disk Card media's advantages over traditional ROM cartridges with a disk size of 128 kilobytes, which was expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of space on the disk, however, it was only in katakana. Rather than passwords, it used rewritable disks to save the game. It used the extra sound channel provided by the Disk System for certain sound effects; most notable are the sounds of Link's sword when his health is full, the roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and enemy death sounds. The sound effects used the Famicom's PCM channel in the cartridge version. It also used the microphone built into the Famicom's controller that was not included in the NES. This led to confusion in the U.S. as the instruction manual reads that Pols Voice, a rabbit-like enemy in the game, "hates loud noise". Blowing or shouting into the Famicom's microphone kills these creatures. However, they cannot be killed through use of the recorder, and on the NES must be killed with weapons.</desc>

The Space Federation sent their mightiest fleet, which was quickly eliminated by the powerful Fortresses.

While the Easter celebration carried on with a grand carnival, evil men gathered in a monastery at the edge of the village and conducted a black mass to resurrect Count Dracula.

The men succeeded in bringing their master back. A bolt of lightning enveloped the monastery where they held the rite, signaling the resurrection of Count Dracula. When the Count returned, his Castle, which had fallen one hundred years prior, reappeared in Transylvania, and his legions of loyal minions reformed.

Simon Belmont, the descendant of Christopher Belmont, knew that as a member of the Belmont Clan and the current wielder of the Vampire Killer whip, it was his duty to bring peace and stability back to Transylvania by destroying Dracula.</desc>

		<desc>A version of Little Computer People for Nintendo's Family Computer Disk System version, published in Japan by DOG (a subsidiary of Square). Based on the original game by Activision.

Unlike previous versions of Little Computer People, the playable character is a girl wearing a pink dress and bow in her hair. The rooms of the house are also in a different configuration, featuring an outdoor balcony on the top floor. When the game is first played, a name for the character is chosen at random from a preprogrammed list. There are no winning conditions on this game you basically watch and interact with the girl in various ways. However, Apple Town Story lacks many of the features found in other versions of Little Computer People.</desc>

In the game, players attempt to destroy each others tanks. If a tank is destroyed, the driver of the tank will exit the vehicle, and must try to stay alive long enough for a replacement tank to parachute down from the sky. Game play continues until only one tank is the sole survivor. Then players advance to a new stage with different terrain. There are 56 stages in total. Tank stats can also be changed in an Editor mode. Despite referencing the name of American General George S. Patton in the title, there is no mention of him anywhere else throughout the game. Although the game was only release in Japan, the loading screen instructions contain English profanity.</desc>

You then need to destroy the fallen opponent by running into it before it can blow up a new balloon and rejoin the battle. Should both of your balloons get popped, you will fall into the water below and lose a life. There is also a second game variation called "balloon trip" where you need to collect as many balloons as possible while avoiding the ocean below and lightning which forms maze like walls.</desc>

		<name>Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit</name>
		<desc>Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up in which the player controls a blue helicopter fighting against waves of enemy vehicles and ground turrets. Each mission takes the helicopter to a different part of the world, each with a distinctive if chromatically plain visual style.

The game's power-ups, available by destroying smaller supply trucks driving across the screen, change the helicopter's weapons but do not make them stronger. It's even possible to collect the weaker original weapon again if the player is too careless. These range from a stronger forward-firing cannon (or laser) to guns that spread fire forwards and to the sides of the helicopter.

You can beat it more than once with enemies taking more hits on subsequent playthroughs.</desc>

		<name>Bishoujo Control</name>
		<desc>Combining all the fun of an arcade shoot'em'up with all the excitement of watching pretty girls, Girl's Control puts you in a spaceship, battling hordes of enemies flying downwards. All that flies is not an enemy, though; you can also shoot at blocks that, when shot, make up a picture of a pretty girl on the right of the screen. Picking up bonuses in the shape of the signs for "pretty girl" powers up your weapon. When all pieces of the picture are picked up, you are given a chance to enjoy the picture at your own pace before progressing to the next level (and the next girl). 

The gameplay can be spiced up by upgrading your spaceship into a much more "phallic" configuration, with bullets looking like big sperm, while the enemies come in the shape of scissors, mouths, pants and syringes. Your ship can also gain a condom shield. Whereas the MSX version starts off like a more normal shooter, progressively becoming more vulgar, this is the default mode in the Famicom version.</desc>

		<name>Bishoujo Shashinkan I: Studio Cut</name>
		<desc>Bishoujo Shashinkan I: Studio Cut is a life simulation game developed by HARD and published by Phoenix for the Famicom Disk System in 1987.
Your task is to photograph pretty girls in various situations. You are given a choice of point-and-shoot, single lens reflex and a pro camera. 
You are only given a few chances per shoot to get the right exposure, or you will just see a miscoloured picture flash briefly. Judging the exposure correctly grants you a picture of the girl, often in a surprising state of undressing, whereafter you progress to even more erotic poses. Later stages raise the difficulty level, forcing you to use the SLR, and later the meter-less pro camera.</desc>

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.</desc>

		<desc>Chitei Tairiku Ordola ("Underground Continent Ordola") is a Famicom Disk System action platformer from SunSoft and the third part of their Chinou Game Series, each borrowing an existing NES game's model (in Ordola's case, Atlantis no Nazo) and adding arithmetic problems to it. In Ordola, the actual math puzzles are relegated to an ancillary mini-game found on the disk.

The goal of the game is to help a young explorer pass through the underground world of Ordola, taking out enemies along the way with his bombs. The bombs fly in a specific arc, so the player needs to be the right distance from the enemy in order to hit it. The player character can also crouch, jump, climb ladders and use other abilities common to platformers.</desc>

		<name>Cleopatra no Mahou</name>
		<desc>Players explore an Egyptian town and ruins from a first-person perspective. The game combines role-playing game elements with an adventure game-like interface. Players may purchase items from shops, though some shopkeepers must be defeated in battle before trading. Battles are turn-based, with options to fight, use items, or flee. Players accumulate experience points by succeeding in battle and "level up" after gaining enough experience, which increases their stamina. Randomly encountered battles with enemies may happen at any time, including when paused to examine the inventory.

The player character, Daisuke Kusano, is the son of an archaeologist who disappeared while searching for the Tears of Isis, artifacts once owned by Cleopatra. During the man's excavation for the Tears, demons appeared and abducted him. The boy soon learns that he must find the Tears in order to save his father. Over the course of the adventure, Daisuke visits the Great Sphinx of Giza, the Temple of Kom Ombo, a tower of sand, and an underground labyrinth. At the end of the game, he discovers that the demons had been disguised as the kindly shopkeeper. Daisuke receives the last Tear of Isis upon defeating the demons, which summons the ghost of Cleopatra, who releases Daisuke's father from imprisonment.</desc>

		<desc>In Clu Clu Land, the player is an female balloonfish named Bubbles who swims around in a maze trying to uncover all the golden Ingots.
Clu Clu Land's story starts with a type of sea urchin, the Unira, stealing all of the treasures in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land. Bubbles, the heroine, sets out to retrieve the treasure. The object of the game is to uncover all the gold ingots in each stage while avoiding the Unira and Black Holes. Ingots usually form a shape such as a heart or a mushroom. The only way Bubbles can turn around to change directions is by means of Turning Posts located throughout the stages. Bubbles can stun the Unira by using a Sound Wave. When they are stunned, Bubbles can push them into a wall to get rid of them and receive points. If Bubbles is hurt by the Unira, she will lose a life. A life is also lost when Bubbles falls into a Black Hole, or when time runs out. The game ends if Bubbles has lost all her lives.</desc>

		<name>Dead Zone</name>
		<desc>In the space calendar 0385, the Earth suffers from overpopulation and humans started to build space colonies. Kirk, the protagonist of Dead Zone, works for the Earth federation's space development office. He is a brilliant engineer in space physics and he is working for Sirius third planet colony. He also got engaged with his beloved girlfriend Marry, but they had to postpone their wedding. Five months later, Kirk, accompanied with his robot Carry, decides to meet Marry at last, and prepare the ceremony. But when he arrives at the space station, everything is quiet. Then a beam of light hits him. He wakes up sometimes later, inside a sort of underground graveyard, pieces of dismantled robots surrounding him.

The player proceeds through the game by choosing from a selection of text menu commands. Like any traditional digital comic/text adventure games, a large view shows the surroundings. The bottom of the screen proposes simple action commands, like see, take or push; however, the game is entirely in Japanese (although it uses katakana exclusively). One of the original features of the game is to use real sampled sound in some places, which is very unusual for the time.</desc>

		<name>Doremikko</name>
		<desc>Doremikko  is a music game developed by Konami for the Famicom Disk System and published in late 1987. Like a few other music games of its kind, it comes complete with a digital keyboard which connects to the Famicom for the purpose of composing and playing music. The inclusion of a large keyboard with the game makes Doremikko the most expensive Famicom Disk System title at the time of its original sale.The title of the game is often mistranslated as "Dreamiko", but it is intended to be a play on the names for the first three notes of a scale; Do, Re, Mi. Having been developed by Konami, the game actually features a medly of Gradius music, and contains a cameo of the Vic Viper on the menu screen. It was only release in Japan, and never translated into any other language.</desc>

		<name>Dr. Chaos : Jigoku no Tobira</name>
		<desc>Dr. Chaos is a side-scrolling action adventure developped by Marionette and published by Pony Canyon. The genius scientist Dr Ginn Chaos has gone missing. Before his disappearance, he was actively working in his large mansion on a device allowing access to alternate dimensions. Armed only with a knife, his brother decides to look for him and ultimately unveil the mystery behind the incident. Something obviously went terribly wrong with Dr. Chaos's experiment, and the goal of the game is to locate all the eleven dimensional warp-zones hidden within the mansion, as well as assembling a powerful laser gun, the only weapon capable of taking down the last boss.</desc>

		<name>Akumajou Dracula II: Noroi no Fuuin</name>
		<desc>The game's setting takes place seven years after the original Castlevania. The prologue begins when Simon visits his family's resting ground. His back is critically injured from his last encounter with Dracula in the previous game. He suddenly feels someone's presence, and turns to see a young woman standing within the mist. She tells him that a curse was placed upon him by Dracula during their last battle, and that he does not have long to live. The woman continues to say that the curse can be undone if he resurrects Dracula himself. She further explains that Dracula's body was split into five different parts after his defeat seven years ago, and Simon must recover these and bring them to the ruins of Dracula's castle. There, he must seal Dracula and defeat him. Before disappearing, the unknown woman says she cannot guarantee that this will destroy Dracula permanently.

Dracula II - Noroi no Fuuin (Lit. "Dracula II: The Seal of the Curse") is an action-adventure game produced by Konami. It was originally released for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan in 1987, and for the NES in North America in 1988. It is the second Castlevania title released for the NES, following the original Castlevania. Set in 1698, seven years after the events of the first installment, the player once again assumes the role of vampire hunter Simon Belmont, who is on a journey to undo a curse placed on him by Dracula at the end of their previous encounter. Small differences exist between the Japanese version and the American version. Specifically the Japanese version takes advantage of the expanded FM processing capabilities of the FDS hardware to produce better sound, but it contains load scenes when entering or exiting any town or mansion. The FDS version also has three save slots instead of the NES password system.</desc>

The game is a remake of "Meikyuu Shinwa" (Eggerland 2; lit. "Labyrinth Myth") for the MSX2 Home Computer System with updated graphics and different music. Furthermore, in this remake the location of some special rooms was swapped, and a final boss battle was introduced.In this Eggerland, Lolo must navigate his way through a non-linear series of rooms, the majority of which occupy a 10x10 arrangement along the main floor of a castle. Many rooms have more than one exit for Lolo to choose from, and a map can be collected along the way to provide the player with information about where he or she is, and what rooms have already been visited. Secret entrances to hidden chambers must be found so that keys can be collected, enabling the player to explore deeper into the castle.</desc>

		<desc>Souzou he no Tabidachi translates to "Departure to Creation." Like with "Revival of the Labyrinth" before, this is a fitting description of the game itself. It references the fact that it brings the Creation Mode from the original back to the series, after it was abandoned in the previous two installments. It further resembles the first title in that it's also one of the most basic entries in the franchise, and among the easiest of the Japanese releases. It's also tied for the shortest game in the entire series, with just fifty puzzles in all. Given that the predecessors all had a hundred or more, this might seems like a problem, but the caliber of the puzzles is as high as ever. So if you found the prequels to be a bit overwhelming, then this might be the best of the early titles to start with. Interestingly, this seems to have been one of the FDS titles that were available solely from Disk Writer machines, as it doesn't appear to have ever been released at retail.</desc>

In each building, Richard navigates service corridors to link the electrical wires between each room, As he does so, animals threaten to chew through the wires. When an electrical connection is complete, the live wires illuminate the connected rooms and electrocute the "enemy" animals on contact. If Richard touches any of the rats, bats, or giant insects in the corridor, he loses a life. In the buildings, the player earns points by illuminating rooms and electrocuting any rats, bats, and insects. Occasionally, a burglar appears; intercepting him rewards the player with bonus points and a bell, which is worth a 1-up.</desc>

		<name>Emi-chan no Moero Yakyuuken!</name>
		<desc>It's a strip janken game. Janken's just a fancy Japanese word for rock-paper-scissors I think, but janken's easier to type. The whole ?strip? part of the game is, for every match you lose, you take off an article of clothing. Woo! For every match you win, Emi (the girl you play against) takes off an article of clothing. WOO! For every match you tie, Emi puts back on an article of clothing. WHAT?! Yeah, it's a pirate game, no one said it had to be fair.

What's even more unfair is, once you get Emi down to like, four articles of clothing, you have to win three times against various barnyard animals. Win three times against a barnyard animal, win against Emi, she loses another article of clothing. Win three MORE times against another barnyard animal, win against Emi, she loses another article of clothing. So yeah, the match is pretty easily stacked in her favor, wouldn't you say? Too bad you don't have any mammals lying around to protect YOU in your strip janken game.

So yeah, just use up and down to cycle through the different hands, and hit A to choose what you want. Yeah, really complicated.</desc>

Like the others in the Exciting series it's a straightforward exemplar of its particular sport. It doesn't have the flair of the original two Exciting games, as it never had an Arcade antecedent.</desc>

		<desc>Exciting Basket (Known in the US as Double Dribble) was a basketball arcade game developed and released in 1987 by Konami. Much of the game's popularity came from its animation sequences showing basketball players performing slam dunks.Players can choose from one of four teams: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. There is no difference in skill level or abilities between the teams. Since there is no NBA license, no team names or player names are used, however, the teams wear the same color of their NBA counterparts (Boston wears green, Chicago red, etc.).</desc>

It was the first of Konami's "Exciting Sports" series produced for the Nintendo Famicom, similar to Namco's own "Family Sports" label. Exciting Billiard offers players four modes of play. Break Shot is a single player only mode, where the player competes against other pool hustlers for money, attempting to earn enough money to graduate to higher and more impressive venues with increasing amounts of money on each bet. The remaining three modes can be played with one to four players at a time (human or computer controlled), with each players' progress capable of being saved to disk.</desc>

		<desc>Humanity has colonized most planets in our galaxy, the Milky Way, and they now look towards expanding their reach by using an experimental travel technology called "Hyperzone Drive". However, a race of aliens who have already mastered that technology are currently invading planets at a quick pace, closing in on our solar system. The invaders attack humanity's colony on Pluto and conquer it with little resistance, since human civilization doesn't have the technology to defend itself.

The human organization responsible for the space program, the "United Space Force", decides to use the yet-untested "Hyperzone Drive" in order to send ships that will directly attack the armies of the invading aliens. However, the new technology proves hard to control, and only one of the ships manages to survive the trip: Falsion.</desc>

		<name>Famicom Grand Prix II : 3D Hot Rally</name>
		<desc>The second game in the Famicom Grand Prix series. In a departure from its predecessor, Famicom Grand Prix II features a behind-the-car view similar to Outrun and Rad Racer. Rather than consisting of a handful of short tracks, 3D Hot Rally provides three long tracks consisting of a variety of different terrain types giving the feel of an actual rally race. Each track has multiple routes to the finish line, requiring you to find the best path to victory. The game features three cars to choose from: the speedy Kattobi coupe, the balanced Yonque truck, or the rugged Monster buggy.



In order to complete a race, players must reach each checkpoint within a certain time limit. If the limit is crossed too late, time is subtracted from their bank. If the time bank is depleted, the race is over. Successfully reaching a checkpoint before the time limit is reached banks extra time. Players can also collect exclamation marks scattered throughout the tracks. Collecting enough exclamation marks to fill the dash meter allows temporary access to the hot dash, a fifth gear that greatly increases speed. Before each race, you're asked to place a repair point somewhere on the track, allowing you to repair any damage done to your car, so long as you pick a route that leads you past that checkpoint. Taking too much damage puts you out of the race.



As the name implies, 3D Hot Rally allows you to use the Famicom 3D System glasses to give the race a real feeling of depth. It also challenged players to submit their best times via Famicom Disk Fax kiosks located in various stores for a chance to win a Disk-kun stationary set.</desc>

		<name>Famicom Grand Prix II : 3D Hot Rally</name>
		<desc>The second game in the Famicom Grand Prix series. In a departure from its predecessor, Famicom Grand Prix II features a behind-the-car view similar to Outrun and Rad Racer. Rather than consisting of a handful of short tracks, 3D Hot Rally provides three long tracks consisting of a variety of different terrain types giving the feel of an actual rally race. Each track has multiple routes to the finish line, requiring you to find the best path to victory. The game features three cars to choose from: the speedy Kattobi coupe, the balanced Yonque truck, or the rugged Monster buggy.



In order to complete a race, players must reach each checkpoint within a certain time limit. If the limit is crossed too late, time is subtracted from their bank. If the time bank is depleted, the race is over. Successfully reaching a checkpoint before the time limit is reached banks extra time. Players can also collect exclamation marks scattered throughout the tracks. Collecting enough exclamation marks to fill the dash meter allows temporary access to the hot dash, a fifth gear that greatly increases speed. Before each race, you're asked to place a repair point somewhere on the track, allowing you to repair any damage done to your car, so long as you pick a route that leads you past that checkpoint. Taking too much damage puts you out of the race.



As the name implies, 3D Hot Rally allows you to use the Famicom 3D System glasses to give the race a real feeling of depth. It also challenged players to submit their best times via Famicom Disk Fax kiosks located in various stores for a chance to win a Disk-kun stationary set.</desc>

		<desc>Once upon a time, there was an elderly couple living in Nagakushi village, a small village located far up in the mountains. The couple had no children, until one day, they were entrusted with the care of an infant boy and girl, as prophesied in a dream. The years went by, and when the two children were 8 years old, there was a terrible occurrence in the western capital. An evil dragon suddenly appeared in the city, turning humans into oni, ogres that suck away the souls of other humans. The oni advanced as far as Nagakushi village, stealing away the souls of the elderly couple. Fortunately the two children were left unharmed, and they set out on a quest to save their adopted parents, not realizing that this adventure would reveal the secret of their true origins...</desc>

		<name>Famicom Mukashibanashi : Shin Onigashima, Zenpen</name>
		<desc>Famicom Mukashibanashi: Shin Onigashima is a Famicom Disk System text adventure game. The plot revolves around an elderly couple with no children who adopt an infant boy and girl. When the children turn six, a dragon appears in the country, and starts turning people into Oni who steal the souls of others. The Oni arrive at their home and steal the elderly couple's souls. The children decide to save their adoptive parents.

The game is controlled by selecting commands such as the "Change Character" command, which allows you to switch between controlling Donbe (the boy) and Hikari (the girl). The game progress is shown by changes in the in-game graphics. The Famicom Disk System version comes on two disks released on different dates. Disk 2 cannot be played without completing Disk 1, and is switched while the system is still powered on. All later releases are switch-free.</desc>

		<name>Famicom Mukashibanashi : Yuuyuuki, Kouhen</name>
		<desc>Famicom Mukashibanashi: Yuuyuuki ("Famicom Fairy Tales: Yuuyuuki") is the second of two text adventure games in the Famicom Mukashibanashi series developed by Pax Softnica and Nintendo themselves for the Famicom Disk System peripheral. It shares many similarities with its predecessor Shin Onigashima: Both games required two disks that were released separately, both feature an innovative "main character switch" feature that allows the player to switch from two playable characters and both are based on ancient Far Eastern literature. In Yuuyuuki's case the literature in question is the ancient Chinese novel Journey to the West.

The player controls Goku (Sun Wukong) and Chao (an original character) who are travelling separate journeys to meet up with each other. True to the novel, Goku is also accompanying the monk Sanzo (Tripitaka) and his other followers Hakkai (Pigsy) and Gojo (Sandy), though these three characters have been comedically reimagined as lazy and greedy.

As with Shin Onigashima and many adventure games for the system the player directs the player character via a menu of commands. They can talk, examine, pick up and otherwise interact with all sorts of people and items in the surroundings. An ability to switch between Goku and Chao is frequently available as well.</desc>

		<desc>Ushiro ni Tatsu Shojo is the successor of and a prequel to Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Kokeisha, and is the second game of the Famicom Tantei Club series. Its scenario was written by Nagihiro Asama, based on the concept by Yoshio Sakamoto.Kenji Yamamoto composed the game music. The popularity of Part I: Kieta Kokeisha prompted the release of this sequel, which employed the similar graphic-adventure gameplay. The game was re-released on the Nintendo Power cartridge rewriting service for the Super Famicom in 1998 with improved graphics and sound.



The objective is to solve two cases; the murder of a schoolgirl investigating her school's ghost story, and an older murder nearing legal expiration. Like the previous game in the series, the game progresses as the player chooses from a set of commands displayed on a menu. These commands are used to interact with other characters and the game's environment, examine clues, or review facts. The results of choosing each command are displayed in the text.</desc>

The laser cannot hit any of the stage's surrounding wall: were it do so, it would cause the level to explode and the player to lose a life (from an initial allotment of five, though this can be increased while playing the game). Much of the time the various reflectors (which send the beam off at a 90 degree angle) and blocks (which simply stop the laser in its tracks) must be maneuvered into place before the laser should be tested on them.</desc>

		<desc>Clox, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 4 Clox, is a falling blocks puzzle game that is superficially similar to Tetris or Columns. Single clock faces depicting one of four angles fall from the top and the player needs to manipulate and place them so they can form larger objects, such as simple formations like squares, diamonds and hourglass shapes to more object-intensive shapes like octagons and hexagons.</desc>

		<name>Famimaga Disk Vol. 6 : Janken Disk Jou</name>
		<desc>Janken Disk Jou, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 6 Janken Disk Jou, is a puzzle game in which the protagonist (who looks uncannily like Disk-kun, the mascot of the Famicom Disk System) must brave a labyrinth of puzzles. In each room there are three variants of hand-shaped blocks between the hero and the exit: each one either making the "scissors" gesture, the "rock" gesture or the "paper" gesture. Pushing a block adjacent to another of a different type causes whichever was the inferior (e.g. with paper and rock, rock is the inferior) to vanish. In addition, each block has a "strength" which is signified by its color: green is level 1, yellow is level 2 and red is level 3. If a green block is pushed next to an inferior red block, the red block will instead become yellow instead of vanishing (and then green with a subsequent superior block, and then will vanish after a third).</desc>

Cannons, tanks, submarines and snipers will blast you with horrific crossfire, while jet fighters zero in from above. To defend yourself, you control the army's advanced all-terrain attack jeep, with its arsenal of guided missiles and incendiary grenades. Of course these are merely tools, and to save your countrymen you'll need more than a handful of gunpowder. You'll need a pocketful of miracles, and the ferocity of a wild Jackal!</desc>

		<name>Fire Rock</name>
		<desc>Fire Rock is an action game developed for the Famicom Disk System by System Sacom, and published in Japan by Use in 1988. The design of the game is credited to Mark Flint. In the game, the player controls what appears to be a cave man, whose goal is to navigate a series of item filled caverns in an effort to locate the boss of the level, defeat it, and then locate the door which leads to the next level. The game is commonly sited as having very poor controls, often requiring the player to grab hold of a wall, and very slowly climb it by holding up and tapping jump repeatedly. Other issues include a very low jump that places more platforms and items out of reach, and a difficult time bringing the character back under control if he starts to slip. This game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

To do so, you must utilize a wide array of attacks to defeat your opponent before they knock you out first. You will compete in six different scenes against 13 different opponents. The game follows in the vein of Yie Ar Kung-Fu, and predates the original Street Fighter by only a couple of months. It features similar concepts such as a distinction between punch and kick attacks, relative directions, and a health bar for each fighter, depicted as a series of paper fans.</desc>

		<name>Fuuun Shourin Ken : Ankoku no Maou</name>
		<desc>Fuuun Shourin Ken: Ankoku no Maou is the sequel to Fuuun Shourin Ken, which was published almost exactly one year prior. Like its predecessor, it features concepts such as a distinction between punch and kick attacks, relative directions, and a health bar for each fighter.



Ankoku no Maou combined the one on one fighting aspect of the game with a visual novel presentation that allowed you to select your next opponent. It also altered the control scheme to something slightly more conventional. All punch attacks are performed with B button while all kick attacks are performed with A button. Pressing both buttons allowed for special actions like leaps and jumping attacks, and blocking was performed by pressing up on the control pad.



In addition to all this, the game also supported the Famicom 3-D System which enabled players to perceive depth in the game by wearing a specially designed headset which placed shutters over either eye extremely rapidly.</desc>

		<desc>The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bullets at and attempting to crash into them. In later stages, some enemies even break from an entering group in a frantic attempt to crash into the player. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost by colliding with an enemy, being hit by an enemy bullet, or being captured.</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay is relatively simple. Swarm after swarm of alien armies attack the player's ship that moves left and right at the bottom of the wraparound screen. The ship can only have one shot on screen at a time. The player defeats one swarm, only to have it replaced by another more aggressive and challenging swarm in the next stage. A plain and repetitive starfield scrolls in the background.</desc>

		<name>Gall Force : Eternal Story</name>
		<desc>Based upon the anime of the same name, Gall Force is a group of science fiction anime OAV series by the studio Artmic, with production by Youmex and AIC. The original character designs were by Kenichi Sonoda. In the original story line, an all-out, prehistoric galactic war rages between the all-female Solnoids and the amorphous Paranoids for too long. In the midst of battle, a plan which was secretly hatched by the leaders of both sides comes into fruition, and an unsuspecting crew of seven Solnoid soldiers aboard the Kulanis-class Cruiser named the Star Leaf is caught up in the middle.

The Famicom Disk System game is a top down shooter and follows a different story than that of the OAVs. It features Rabby flying across Terra, and catapulting into six different regions of space in order to rescue each of her crew members one at a time. With each crew member that you rescue, you gain access to a new configuration for your ship.</desc>

		<desc>Jaaman Tanteidan: Matonarikumi (also known as Jaaman Tanteidan Marine Kumi: Maruhi Jigoma Sousa File) is an adventure game from Bandai that uses the license of a TV show that was also the basis of Bandai's earlier action game Omoikkiri Tanteidan Haado Gumi: Matenrou no Chousenjou. Both games feature teams of schoolchildren detectives as they hunt down an elusive thief in a mask and cape.The game follows a sub-genre of Japanese adventure games that include a top-down RPG style world map to walk around on, rather than simply selecting destinations from a menu. Otherwise the game is similar to other NES Portopia/Tantei Club-derived detective adventure games; the player must search for clues, talk to witnesses and suspects and solve inventory-based puzzles in order to proceed.</desc>

		<desc>Ginga Denshou - Galaxy Odyssey is a game developed for the Family Computer Disk System by Wave Jack, and published by Imagineer in 1986. Unlike most games for the FDS, Galaxy Odyssey did not come with just a disk and an instruction booklet. Among the contents found in the large box, were an audio cassette tape and a book recounting the game's story.The game itself is quite unusual as well. It features a blend of vertical shooting gameplay mixed with more Zelda-like exploration sequences. As the pilot of a ship, you could dock with certain dungeon entrances, and take a shuttle down to the ground to explore and search for items. Searching around isn't easy at first, since you run out of oxygen fairly quickly, and that starts to drain your life, of which you start out with three bars.To win the game, you must find the medicine needed to rescue the people who are suffering from a disease in your home area. To do so, you must collect warp codes, and translate alien codes, and blast off from one dungeon location to travel to another. The game's text is in Japanese, and has never been translated to another language.</desc>

		<name>Golf : Japan Course</name>
		<desc>An update of sorts to Golf. Players get to take control of Nintendo's mascots Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses modeled after real courses in Japan.

Players can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play. Match play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by getting the better score than their competitor. Stroke play differs as it just involves the golfer trying to get the best score possible by completing each hole in as few strokes as possible.

When on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the direction they want to hit the ball. Hitting the ball involves the use of a meter with an icon that goes back and forth, which gauges the distance the ball is hit. Players can take a step back from the tee and take practice swings so they can get into a rhythm using this meter.

This game also contained a now defunct feature where players could record their personal information and their best scores and then bring the game disk to a Disk Fax machine. Inserting the disk into this machine would fax over the player's information to Nintendo's headquarters. This information was used for a contest. Being selected a contest winner would award the player with a golden colored disk version of this game. This golden disk version of the game contained an exclusive course that was not present on the original version of this game.</desc>

		<name>Golf: U.S. Course</name>
		<desc>A slightly updated companion title to Golf - Japan Course released just a few months earlier. The graphics are more updated and the gameplay is a little more advanced as well. Players get to take control of Nintendo's mascots Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses modeled after real courses in the USA.

Players can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play. Match play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by getting the better score than their competitor. Stroke play differs as it just involves the golfer trying to get the best score possible by completing each hole in as few strokes as possible.

When on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the direction they want to hit the ball. Hitting the ball involves the use of a meter with an icon that goes back and forth, which gauges the distance the ball is hit. Players can take a step back from the tee and take practice swings so they can get into a rhythm using this meter.

This game also contained a now defunct feature where players could record their personal information and their best scores and then bring the game disk to a Disk Fax machine. Inserting the disk into this machine would fax over the player's information to Nintendo's headquarters. This information was used for a contest. Being selected a contest winner would award the player with a golden colored disk version of this game.

		<path>./No-Intro/FDS/Goonies (Japan) (Disk Writer).fds</path>
		<name>Goonies</name>
		<desc>The Goonies was developed by Konami in 1986. Naturally, it is based somewhat on the movie of the same name, where a boy named Mikey and his friends discover the treasure of a pirate just in time to prevent their home town from being bought out by greedy land developers. While the game incoporates some of the more identifiable aspects of the movie, it follows a decidedly different plot line, with the gang of Mikey's friend captured by the Frateli family, one of the movie's antagonists. Mikey is therefore required to proceed from stage to stage and rescue them, while exploring labyrinthine dungeons and locating power-up items.  There are six stages in all. Power-ups and diamonds are hidden from sight. To reveal them, players must discover the particular joystick input specific to the stage they are hidden in. After the player completes the stages at the first level of difficulty, the input required for each stage changes in the second level. Many secrets are scattered throughout the game including cameos from the likes of Konamiman, and Twinbee. Even a secret warp can be found in order to bypass one level. Many of the features and items introduced in this version found their way into the more advanced sequel.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the arcade game of the same name, the player's objective in the FDS version was changed from rescuing prisoners to destroying a secret weapon being developed in the enemy's headquarters. Additionally, a 2-players co-operative mode was introduced as well, allowing two players to play simultaneously (with Player 1 in blue and Player 2 in red). The play mechanics are essentially identical to the arcade version, however the Flamethrower is removed (only the Rocket Launcher and Grenades remained) and two new power-up items are introduced: a Star mark which grants invincibility and a pistol with unlimited ammo, both which are only usable for a limited period. The FDS version also features two additional stages that were not in the arcade game: an airport set between the Missile Base and the Harbor, where the player faces a group of rocket soldiers at the end; and a new final stage set inside the enemy's base in which the player must disarm a nuclear missile at the end that is about to be launched; by using rocket launchers dropped by enemy soldiers. The flamethrower corps at the end of the Warehouse stage was replaced by a paratrooper unit.</desc>

		<name>Gun.Smoke</name>
		<desc>The objective is to free the town of Hicksville from the band of criminals known as the Wingates. But in order to capture their most dangerous henchmen, in each stage the player must retrieve a Wanted sign of said henchman, otherwise it is impossible to clear the stage. In this game, the main character is a bounty hunter named Billy Bob.

Although virtually identical to the NES version, the FDS version featured several differences:

This game, like virtually all other FDS games, feature load times.

The font is similar to what is used in most Capcom games on the Famicom/NES. However, on the NES version, the font is changed to the military-font, also seen in the arcade version.

"In America" is changed to "In 1849".
Bandit Bill's mugshot on the wanted poster is slightly different in both versions of the game. In the FDS version, his shirt has an open collar, with part of his body showing. In the NES version, his shirt has a scarf around it. On top of that, the mugshots for the wanted posters originally had an Anime look, whereas in the NES version, they had a realistic look.

In this version, the shopping music features less instruments. Also, many of the tunes featured in the NES version are nowhere to be found in this version, and instead recycle the same music for certain scenes in the game. This is due to the limited memory space in FDS disk cards.

There is no game demonstration like there is in the NES version.

After beating the game the first two times, the player is rewarded with a Japanese message that tells the player to try the game again. After the third time, the player will be rewarded with a simple message that says "THE END". The Japanese message was thrown out in the NES version, instead of being translated into English.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/FDS/Gyruss (Japan) (Beta) (1988-10-03).fds</path>
		<name>Gyruss</name>
		<desc>Gyruss  is a shoot 'em up arcade game designed by Yoshiki Okamoto and released by Konami in 1983. The majority of enemies are spaceships, which must be destroyed to complete a level. They appear either from the centre of the screen or from one of the edges, and move in swirling patterns. They can shoot the player's ship or destroy it by contact. They hover near the centre of the screen after completing their deployment pattern, and occasionally fly outwards and shoot at the player. If not destroyed by the player, the enemy ships gradually fly away one by one.

The gameplay is similar to that of Galaga but presented in a forced 3D perspective, with the player's ship facing 'into' the screen and able to move around the perimeter of an implicit circle. The scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games is arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving through space.

Gyruss was also remade for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America, released by Konami's subsidiary Ultra Games. In these versions of the game, the core gameplay is still largely the same, but there are several major revisions. The game was well received in North America. Revisions include:

Updated graphics

Additional control options

The music from the arcade version of the game was slightly remixed, and several additional tracks composed by Atsushi Fujio, Yuichi Sakakura, and Harumi Ueko were added.

The player starts off at "Three Warps To Neptune" instead of "Two Warps"

The player can use a super phaser attack in addition to the normal guns

There are additional enemies, including boss fights when the player reaches each planet

Bonus stages after each planet's boss is defeated, for a chance to gain additional powerups
    
There is a definite ending to the game. In the NES version, it's a brief text about the Universe being at peace. In the FDS version, there is a full ending sequence with credits.

In addition to the satellites providing the usual double guns and bonus points, they can also provide extra phasers, a smart bomb, and even an extra life

Instead of the arcade's looping 24 stages, there are 39 looping. In the arcade, the player starts from Neptune and proceeds to Earth. On the NES version, the player travels through the entire Solar System, including Neptune, Pluto, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury, and the Sun.

The player can enter the Konami code at the title screen for extra lives, but with a twist: the code must be entered in reverse (A-B-A-B-right-left-right-left-down-down-up-up) instead of in the original sequence.</desc>

		<name>Halley Wars</name>
		<desc>It’s the middle of the 21st century. The armies of Lord Halley are launching attacks on planet Earth. You are the last chance for Earth, piloting a craft specially developed to engage these hordes. You must fight your way through their defenses to the final goal, the alien base. The final battle is about to commence!

Halley Wars is a vertical scrolling shooter. The game has 6 stages set in locations in space such as, above planets or in asteroid fields. There are end of levels bosses at the end of each stage each with their own weaknesses. There are power-ups, which can be picked up along the way when you shoot particular asteroids or satellites. These upgrade your weapon strength, speed, add explosive pods and shields.

Where the game stood out was, there are comets that need to be destroyed on your journey. Each comet and ship that you don’t shoot makes it to earth and does some damage there. Comets do more damage than the enemy ships do. If Earths damage level reaches 100% the game is over. For every 2000 points you score, 1% of Earths damage is repaired.</desc>

		<name>Hikari Shinwa : Palthena no Kagami</name>
		<desc>In a time where humans and gods coexisted in harmony, the kingdom of Angel Land was ruled by two goddesses, Palutena the Goddess of Light and Medusa the Goddess of Darkness. While Palutena administered the light and helped the mortals cultivate their crops, Medusa despised the mortals and used the darkness to destroy their crops and turn the mortals into stone. Enraged, Palutena transformed Medusa into a hideous monster and banished her into the dark Underworld.

But Medusa would not go quietly. She assembled an army of monsters and evil spirits of the underworld to conquer Palutena's home, the Palace in the Sky. War erupted and Medusa's minions overwhelmed Palutena's army, eventually imprisoning the Goddess of Light. Medusa then seized the Three Sacred Treasuresâ€”the Mirror Shield, the Arrow of Light, and the Wings of Pegasusâ€”and gave them to her most powerful minions.

Defeated and imprisoned, Palutena's only hope was to seek the help of Pit, a young angel trapped in the Underworld. Using the last of her strength, she sent Pit a magical bow. Thus, Pit set out on a quest to escape the Underworld, retrieve the Sacred Treasures that would help him defeat Medusa, and rescue Palutena and restore peace to Angel Land.

The original Famicom Disk System versions feature save slots, unlike the North American version which uses a password system (known in-game as "Sacred Words"). As with Metroid, the FDS version of Kid Icarus also features higher-quality music and sound effects that take advantage of the system's additional sound channels.</desc>

		<name>I Am a Teacher : Teami no Kiso</name>
		<desc>I Am A Teacher: Teami no Kiso (roughly "I Am A Teacher: The Basics of Hand-Knitting") is an instructional tool to help would-be knitters create their own garments. The user can input the amount, length and type of wool they have and the size and type of the item of clothing they wish to create and the program will put together a guide to help them achieve this goal. The user can save their progress at any time and pick up from where they left off.

Unlike Super Mario no Sweater, its predecessor in the I Am A Teacher series, there are no Nintendo characters present in Teami no Kiso. Rather, Teami no Kiso is a guide for teaching the fundamentals of knitting to novices, with Super Mario no Sweater intended for those who already have some experience who wish to try new Mario-themed designs.

As with Super Mario no Sweater, Teami no Kiso was commissioned by major Japanese wool and sewing products manufacturer Royal Kougyou, but it's believed that Nintendo developed and published the game themselves.</desc>

So it's up to Nana and Popo to climb up the ice-covered top of the mountain to get the vegetables back from Condor. You'll do this by hopping up platforms while avoiding various enemies and obstacles before your time runs out.

Interestingly the Famicom Disk System port is actually based on the arcade version Vs. Ice Climber and differs from the console version in ways such as an animated title screen, stage select menu, 16 additional mountains, occasional blizzard and wind effects, more enemy characters, and bonus multiplier items.</desc>

		<name>Ice Hockey</name>
		<desc>The play and mechanics of Ice Hockey are mostly similar to that of ice hockey in real life. The objective for both team is to hit a black puck with a hockey stick that each player carries into the opponent's goal. Teams are made up of five players including the goaltender, as opposed to six in real life. Players wear ice skates, which are used to skate across the icy arena. Each game is made up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking/defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design. If two opposing players fight for the puck for a certain amount of time, other players join into the fight, resulting in the player from the losing team in the fight to be put in the penalty box for a period of time.</desc>

		<name>Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School</name>
		<desc>The game's protagonist enters Tokimeki High School and runs into a girl wearing glasses who looks identical to Miho Nakayama. Though the game is a standard text command-style adventure game similar to the Famicom Tantei Club series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the "game over" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other text adventure games where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.</desc>

This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.</desc>

		<name>Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School</name>
		<desc>The game's protagonist enters Tokimeki High School and runs into a girl wearing glasses who looks identical to Miho Nakayama. Though the game is a standard text command-style adventure game similar to the Famicom Tantei Club series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the "game over" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other text adventure games where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game.

		<name>Igo : Kyuu Roban Taikyoku</name>
		<desc>Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku is the first real attempt to bring the Japanese board game Go to a home console, namely the Famicom. The game was designed by Henk Rogers, a Dutch programmer who would play games of Go against the CEO (at the time) of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi. It was during one such game that the prospect of developing such a title for the Famicom was discussed. It was later converted from disk format to cartridge and release in August 1987.

Prior to the release of this game, Nintendo had released a game which was played on the Go board in 1983, known as Gomoku Narabe Renju, but the play mechanics were more akin to "Connect Four" (or five, as it were). The real game of Go is traditionally played on a 19 Ã— 19 grid, but the permutations of possibilities would take too long for the Famicom's processor to consider, so the board size has been significantly reduced to a 9 Ã— 9 grid, which allows for a smoother single player experience. The game also features a lesson mode, in which ninjas appear to teach the player about the rules and strategy of the game.</desc>

		<name>Ishidou</name>
		<desc>Ishido is a puzzle board game consisting of a set of 72 stones and a game board of 96 squares.

Every stone has two attributes: a color and a symbol. There are six colors and six symbols in each stone set, thus creating 36 unique stones. Since each stone comes in a pair, there are therefore 72 stones in each stone set.

The primary objective of Ishido is to place all 72 stones onto the board of 96 squares. The challenge arises because stones must be placed adjacent to others that they match, either by color or symbol. When the board begins to fill up, this objective is not so easily accomplished.

A valuable move is the 4-way, in which a stone is placed in the midst of four others, two of which are matched by color, and two which are matched by symbol.

Ishido comes with 6 differently themed stone sets, 5 different game boards, and a variety of Oriental chimes and sound effects.</desc>

		<desc>The player must go around each stage and collect every sphere in order to progress. Each sphere can change the polarity of the character from red to blue and vice versa. Each stage is littered with blue and red arrows: Being the same color as these arrows will magnetize the player character, which has different effects depending on the direction the arrow is pointing: For instance, an arrow pointing down will push the player to the ground if they are the reverse color but a same-colored character can hover across as the blocks will hold them up. Conversely, an arrow pointing up will allow players of the opposite color to jump far higher from the arrow, but will almost entirely eliminate the jumping power of a same-colored character as it pulls them down.</desc>

		<name>Kaettekita Mario Bros.</name>
		<desc>Kaettekita Mario Bros. ("The Return of Mario Bros.") is an updated rerelease of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, which was one of the first games to be ported to the NES console. It adds a few new features to the format, including improved controls for Mario, cutscenes and the ability to save high scores with the Famicom Disk Reader's save function, but is otherwise identical.

The game was part of the Disk Writer system in Japan, where players could write new games over old Famicom disks at special machine vendors found in video game stores and other likely locales. This made the games cheaper to buy (as it minimized production costs) but also made games that were exclusive to this service, such as Kaettekita Mario Bros, harder to find for collectors.

Inexplicably, the game also has a sponsor: Nagatanien, a Japanese producer of seasonings for rice and noodle dishes. Mario had also previously appeared on Nagatanien Japanese TV commercials. This makes Kaettekita Mario Bros. an early example of an advergame.

The European version of Mario Bros., named Mario Bros. Classic, was based off this game rather than the NES original.</desc>

		<desc>The player assumes the role of a karate competitor and fights against another player or the computer. Using two joysticks, players can execute a number of moves.

Gameplay consists of a two dimensional fight between Karate characters wearing white and red gi, followed by various bonus rounds for the successful player. This pattern repeats itself in the next, more challenging round set against a new background. Unlike most later fighter-type games, there are no health bar or hit points. A hit successfully landed ends the round and earns the player or his opponent either one point or half point (along with a numeric score for the top ten but this has no effect on winning a match per se). The first to score two points is the winner. If the player loses a battle, the game ends. The game also featured some early speech synthesis, in which the judge would call out such phrases as "Fight!" or "Winner!" It's also spoken in Japanese in the Japanese version.</desc>

Kick Challenger: Air Foot: Vegetable Country Foot Soldier) is an action game developed by Vap for the Famicom Disk System and published in 1987. It is a single player game where the player takes control of a tomato as he marches upward through four stages in an effort to rescue his country from insects and other invaders.

You control the tomato by independently directing his two feet, one foot at a time. He make kick in eight directions with whichever foot is not planted in the ground at the given moment. Power ups are revealed by kicking trees, flowers, mushrooms, and other obstacles that are scattered throughout each stage. They may take the form of shoes which grant him the ability move on certain surfaces, or candy which gives him special abilities. Each stage has a "back side" which is accessed by stepping on holes in the ground reveal under kicked obstacles, and provide more power-ups to find.</desc>

		<name>Kieta Princess</name>
		<desc>The Kingdom of Rabia's princess goes missing during a visit to Japan, surrounding the investigation of the medicine to an "epidemic dementia," known as "Oninofuguri", and the prevention of its importing. The player takes the role of a detective determined to unravel the mystery of the missing princess Kilala, in this RPG style adventure game. Yasuko Tomita served as the model of one of the characters. Certain telephone numbers would appear, which, if called, would provide the player with a hint, spoken by Yasuko Tomita.

In order to track down Kobayashi, the criminal protagonist, you must visit five different towns and collect information. Neary every house and building can be entered, which was unique for its time. The game also features a high degree of freedom, allowing you to visit restaurants for a bite, or a Dojo to train, or to hunt for vegetation to sell for money, while you are looking for the princess.

Another introduced concept that was novel for its time was the notion of day and night changing the appearance of the city. During the evening, you may encounter a street gang, and they may open fire on you, although you can defend yourself with a revolver. However, if over 20 innocent people are gunned down, you will be arrested and sent to the police station where you must pay a fine and return to the starting point.

The degree of difficult throughout the game is considered quite high, with very few hints to help you out, while other hints are misleading. For example, one hint suggests that you if you sleep over night at a particular crossroad in a city, you will get a key item, but this hint is false. Although you are supposedly a detective, you never actually get to accuse anyone of a crime.</desc>

		<name>Knight Lore : Majou no Ookami Otoko</name>
		<desc>Knight Lore is a a 3D isometric adventure game by Jaleco, originally released by the British game company Ultimate. Saberman, the hero of the game, has been cursed by an evil wizard. Every night, he turns into a creepy werewolf and he is on a journey to retrieve all the necessary ingredients to create a magic potion. This potion, he hopes, will get him to return to his human shape. The game starts in a dark forest, somewhere in there the wizard awaits for the potion's ingredients such as diamonds, bottles etc... Our hero's task is to wander around and find them, one at the time, and bring them back to him. But our hero must watch out, he turns into a werewolf at night and the wizard won't hesitate to use his magic against him. Saberman must make sure to always approach him as a human. Up to three items can be carried at the same time, they can also be dropped on the ground and climbed to reach higher platforms. However, once a new ingredient is delivered to the wizard, our hero leaves empty handed and lose all stored items. Series of enemies and hazards are of course scattered along his path, such as spirits, spikes or pits. Once all the ingredients are collected, the game jumps to another location where more objects need to be found with meaner hazards and enemies. This is also the point where the player's progress can be saved.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/FDS/Knight Move (Japan) (Rev 1) (Disk Writer).fds</path>
		<name>Knight Move</name>
		<desc>The game is based around the concept of how a knight piece is moved in the game of chess. The player controls a knight chess piece that is constantly jumping and must continually choose which of the possible legal moves to make before the knight lands back on the board.

When the knight lands on any square on the board, it turns from white to light teal. Landing there again, turns it dark teal. Landing there yet again destroys the square altogether, leaving a hole that the player must avoid. Falling in a hole will result in a game over. Consecutively creating several holes results in a chain increasing the player's score in differing increments.

At the beginning of each "round", a heart is placed somewhere on the board. A heart (or multiple hearts) must be collected to advance to the next round, which thereby replaces all holes on the board with new white squares and places a new heart somewhere on the board. Depending on the game mode, hearts will sometimes move themselves every few jumps of the knight.

The player can also gather a small amount of extra points, at any time, by holding the A button and speeding up the knight's movement. The main objective in Knight Move is to continue this cycle, despite the increasing game speed, and reach the highest score possible.

The game also includes a simultaneous 2 player versus mode similar to the single player modes.</desc>

All teams are fictional but based out of real Canadian and American cities. The game is known for its fast paced hockey action and especially for the fighting. It is a one or two player game. When playing against the computer, there are three difficulty levels to choose from: Junior, College, and Pro (with Pro being the most difficult and Junior being the easiest). Each team consists of three forwards, two defense men, and a goaltender.</desc>

		<desc>Konamic Tennis is part of a long line of Konami sports games made specifically for the Famicom and its Famicom Disk System peripheral, which had previously used the term "Exciting" to signify its Konami status: As is the case with games such as Exciting Baseball or Exciting Basketball (known in the west as Double Dribble). Instead, this and future Konami sports games for the system would have the "Konamic" appellation; a portmanteau of "Konami" and "dynamic". At least, this is how the same pun in its original Japanese is commonly transliterated.

Konamic Tennis follows a similar design philosophy as other tennis games at the time (and would be used for most of the ones to follow) by depicting the action from behind the serving player's side of the court. It follows the rules of the sport precisely, with a single game usually ending after four successful volleys (scored as 15, 30, 40 and Game) and the first to win six games deciding a set. Players can choose between a single set match or a longer 3-set match. They can also play in a tournament or a single one-on-one game with a CPU (or human) opponent of their choosing.

One feature Konamic Tennis introduces to the genre is that of the serving view, shown as an inset whenever a player serves the ball to start a game. The goal is to hit the ball at precisely the right moment to serve an excellent shot; too early or too late will cause the player to either hit the net or send the ball too far, or simply not hit the ball at all. In all these cases, it counts as a foul and the player has one more chance to correctly serve the ball, otherwise points are awarded to the opponent.</desc>

Every moving object from mice to beetles, is lethal to Milo and must be avoided. Fruit can be dropped on enemies for extra points. Eggs can be collected to use as weapons which must be dropped on enemies. Bottles of milk grant temporary invincibility.

		<desc>Link no Bouken - The Legend of Zelda 2 is the second installment in The Legend of Zelda series, published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was originally released in Japan on the Famicom Disk System less than a year after the release of The Legend of Zelda. 

The Adventure of Link is a direct sequel to the original The Legend of Zelda, and again involves the protagonist Link on a quest to save Princess Zelda -- who is not the same Princess from the first game, but another member of the royal family by the same name, who was placed under a sleeping spell a long time ago. The Adventure of Link's emphasis on side-scrolling and RPG-style elements, however, was a significant departure from its predecessor and has given it a reputation as the "black sheep" of the Zelda series. It is arguably the hardest Zelda game. Despite this reputation, the game was highly successful and introduced many elements that would become commonplace in future Zelda games.</desc>

		<name>Marchen Veil</name>
		<desc>A long time ago, people from Ferikusu could communicate with the gods and divine spirits. The king of the kingdom is now looking for a young man to marry his daughter, the royal princess. Many contestants are selected and a tournament is organized to decide of the new prince. However, before the end or the ceremony, an evil magician sends the last hero, the one the princess has fallen in love with, to an unknown and desolated world. He also quickly realizes that he fell under a terrible curse, and he has been turned into a weird creature. The only item he has left is a magic bracelet the princess gave him. The player takes control of the lost prince and his journey will take him back to where he came from, confront the evil magician and marry the princess he loves. Each stage starts with a short animation (called a "visual stage") which unfolds the story as the game progresses. The rest of the game follows a classic top-view action formula, where the hero defeats all kind of enemies with the help of his magic powers. Sometimes, special items can be found under tree logs or rocks.</desc>

		<name>Magma Project : Hacker</name>
		<desc>Magma Project Hacker is a sci-fi themed RPG and an adaptation of the 1985 PC/Amiga/Atari ST strategy game Hacker. As with the Famicom Disk System adaptation of Monty on the Run, a considerable number of liberties were taken with the game's themes practically transforming it into a completely different game. Ironically, the story more closely resembles another western PC game, Captive, with its plot.
The player character witnesses a murder and is told to seek information on a shadowy organization known as the Magma Project by the dying victim. In order to effectively hunt for clues, the player character uses a device to activate a robot on the other side of the planet and employs the robot's various combat and exploration functions to track down the Magma Project.</desc>

This obviously has it's effect on the rules.</desc>

		<name>Mahjong Kazoku</name>
		<desc>Mahjong Kazoku ("Mahjong Family") is a standard Mahjong simulation game for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System. It is a one-on-one version of the game, rather than the standard four-player board game arrangement, and it incorporates many of the various and byzantine scoring rules of the game.
Irem developed and published the game but left a mysterious licensing credit to Ox Inc. on the title screen. It's possible the game is a port of an obscure Japanese Mahjong computer game, or at least borrows some of its coding for the AI opponent or scoring systems.</desc>

He rains thunder down upon the tower to drive people away. In order to keep people away from the tower, god fills it up with giant creatures and evil spiritsnnSeveral thousands of years later, the strongest devil Asmodeous gains control over all of the creatures and spirits that god placed in the tower. He attacks the neighboring towns, and steals all of their golden and silver treasures, as well as the most beautiful maiden in the land.
Your mission of salvation is to rescue the maiden, and destroy the cursed tower in order to return peace to the world.</desc>

		<name>Meikyuu Jiin Dababa</name>
		<desc>The game takes place in India, where a young man's significant-other is kidnapped by an evil wizard. He must then tackle the four areas of the labyrinth temple of Dababa to rescue her.

In order to accomplish this task, the player cannot simple move across the floor. Rather, the player and all of the enemies hop from one square tile to another, throughout the game. In a majority of stages, the player must uncover the seals which will unlock the door to the next stage by leaping on to the particular tiles which keep the seals concealed. Not every door will take the player forward, however, as some doors are trick doors that may take the player to a previous stage. In some stages, the player must simply survive the onslaught of enemies, while in others, the player is racing against the clock.</desc>

		<desc>Michael English Daibouken (lit: "Michael's English Grand Adventure") is an educational game where the character of Michael, an orange cat, teaches kittens the various letters in the English language as well as some English vocabulary. Michael has to catch floating letters in order to spell out English words, while avoiding the incorrect letters. The game has various different backdrops, including space.

The character of Michael comes from the Japanese serial manga strip "What's Michael", created by Makoto Kobayashi which might be considered analogous to Garfield, due to them both being orange cats. It varies between observing goofy pet behavior to more abstract tales of fantasy with anthropomorphized versions of the animal characters.</desc>

		<desc>Moero TwinBee can be played by up to three player simultaneously: the first two players control TwinBee and WinBee (the ships from the previous game) using the standard Famicom controllers, whereas the third player controls GwinBee (a green ship) by connecting an additional controller into the console's expansion port. Unlike the original TwinBee, which only featured vertical-scrolling stages, Stinger adds side-scrolling stages to the mix as well. There are seven stages in the game. Stage 1, 3, and 7 are side-scrolling stages, while the rest are vertical-scrolling stages. The controls remain the same between the two styles of gameplay, with the only difference being that in the side-scrolling segments, the A button shoots hearts over the ship instead of dropping bombs into the ground like the vertical-scrolling segments, which helps the player keep the power-up bells afloat in the side-scrolling stages.</desc>

Rather than using the shape of the edges to determine what pieces fit next to one another, you must use the animation on the pieces to determine their arrangement. When each puzzle begins, the pieces are also oriented randomly, so you may be required to flip them vertically or horizontally in order to complete the puzzle. There are 10 different animations, and you can choose between dividing the images into 16, 24, or 48 distinct pieces before attempting to solve the puzzle.

		<desc>A Disk Writer only release, The Monitor Puzzle Kinetic Connection - Kineco II is the sequel in which new puzzles are introduced. Like it's prequel the game challenges player to piece together ten images in a jigsaw puzzle like fashion. However, every piece is exactly the same size, and the images on the pieces move. Rather than using the shape of the edges to determine what pieces fit next to one another, you must use the animation on the pieces to determine their arrangement. When each puzzle begins, the pieces are also oriented randomly, so you may be required to flip them vertically or horizontally in order to complete the puzzle. There are 10 different animations, and you can choose between dividing the images into 16, 24, or 48 distinct pieces before attempting to solve the puzzle. Obviously, the fewer pieces, the easier it is to solve.</desc>

		<name>Monty on the Run : Monty no Doki Doki Dai Dassou</name>
		<desc>Monty no Doki Doki Dai Dassou  (Monty's heart pounding great escape), also known as Monty on the Run, is an action game developed for the Famicom Disk System by Jaleco in 1987. This game was the product of Jaleco acquiring the rights to license and publish a hit game from the European computer market titled Monty on the Run. However, unlike a similar previous effort with Knight Lore which stays close to the original source, Jaleco changed the game entirely for unknown reasons.
In Monty no Doki Doki Dai Dassou , Monty is a human being who has escaped from a penitentiary. Still dressed in striped convict clothing, Monty is on a mission to clear his name. He must proceed through four levels, each of which contains several hidden tiles. These tiles contain portions of the image of a face. At the end of each level, Monty must jump on to a platform just before the exit. This platform is a direct clue to the proper construction of the collected tiles. There are more tiles than necessary to construct a face, making some tiles extraneous. Only by paying proper attention to this final platform can the player know which face to construct. At the end of the game, the player must properly reconstruct the face of the true criminal before a judge. If the player succeeds, he will earn his freedom and win the game.</desc>

		<desc>The game starts out by depositing the pinball in the middle of a simulated pinball table. However, once the ball is shot into one of the holes on the play field, the game enters an elaborate intro sequence which the player can control. The game contains 11 stages, each of which contain a target hole that the player must hit the ball into in order to advance to the next stage. The stages get more elaborate, and more moving obstacles appear to interfere with the behavior of the ball. In addition to controlling the flippers, the control pad can also be used to "nudge" the ball in either direction, although the effectiveness of this varies.</desc>

		<name>Namida no Soukoban Special</name>
		<desc>Namida no Soukoban Special (which roughly translates into Warehouse Keeper's Tears Special) is a game that was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 by ASCII Entertainment. By 1986, many of Japan's game players were familiar with Soukoban in one form or another since its introduction in 1982. Rather than publish yet another version of the same old game, ASCII attempted to enhance the Soukoban experience for its debut on the Famicom by providing players with a unique set of tools that let players "cheat" in some fashion in comparison to the original rules. Objects like Magnets and Pulleys provided players with a limited ability to pull boxes, something which the original versions of the game prohibited. Objects such as these, or pepper, or oil, were discovered by pushing certain boxes that hid the items underneath. Progress through the game could be saved to the disk to prevent forcing players to solve puzzles that had already been solved.</desc>

		<name>Nankin no Adventure</name>
		<desc>Nankin no Adventure is a Famicom Disk System adventure game from SunSoft that plays much like every other Famicom adventure game of the era. The player selects commands from a menu in order to talk to NPCs and solve puzzles which will eventually allow them to progress. As with many of these Famicom text adventures there is a linear critical path that the player must follow in order to move to new areas and reach the next point of the story.
Nankin refers to a semi-obscure manga artist of the same name who was behind much of the art design of the game. Though the game doesn't include any of his pre-existing licenses, his distinctive art style is present throughout. This approach might be equated to Akira Toriyama's artistic involvement with the Dragon Quest and Chrono games</desc>

		<name>Nazo no Kabe : Block Kuzushi</name>
		<desc>In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.

But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.

There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.

Nazo no Kabe - Block Kuzushi  is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.</desc>

Your have two weapons: (unlimited) shurikens for ranged attacks and a sword for melee combat. The sword is automatically used when you are close enough to an enemy, and it can also be used to deflect enemy shurikens. But since you are constantly under attack by ninjas from all directions and also have only a limited time to finish each stage, the game is still quite hard.</desc>

		<name>Nazoler Land : Soukan Gou</name>
		<desc>Nazoler Land Soukan Gou is the first in a series of minigame collections from SunSoft developed especially for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. It was followed by two direct sequels and a quiz-based spin-off.

Nazoler Land Soukan Gou (or Nazoler Land Vol. 1) has eight minigames that the player can select from a menu after loading the game up and switching the disk around. These are:
Rotation Maze

A maze-like puzzle game where a small circular being has to pass through a maze filled with dividers. The player can only pass through these dividers if there is room for it to turn around, otherwise it blocks the player's progress. The goal is to find the correct path through the maze.
Nazoler Fortune-Telling

Despite using signs of the Zodiac and suggesting a fortune-telling aspect, the game is actually a variant on the classic strategy board game Mastermind: The goal is to find the right combination of Zodiac symbols, and the game will provide hints by reporting whenever the player includes the right symbol, either in the correct place (represented by a solid star) or the wrong place (represented as a hollowed star).
Super Jigsaw

In this game the player simply has to reconstruct an image after pieces of it have been jumbled up. All the player must do is use two cursors to point to the two pieces they wish to switch around. Restoring the image to its initial state completes the challenge.
Save Princess Momoko!

Promoted as the "major feature", or the most fully-developed of the minigames. The goal is to explore a dungeon in a first-person perspective, similar to classic dungeon crawlers such as Wizardry, Dungeon Master or Shining in the Darkness, while finding items and using the correct items on the right monsters to proceed past them. Encountering these monsters before finding the right item to defeat them causes the player to lose, so there's a degree of trial and error.
Japan's Best Surroundings: Ultra Travel Quiz

A quiz based on traveling around Japan and general geographical facts. The player selects which type of transportation (train, plane, etc.) they wish to take and answers questions relating to it.
Famicom Reaction Test

In this simple "game", two players compete to hit the button on their controller as many times as they can in the short time limit. This test is presented like a Wild West duel.
Extrusion Puzzle

Similar to Super Jigsaw, only the player is sliding blocks around to make a puzzle appear. Pushing one block that's against another causes all touching blocks to move at once.
3D Maze

A simple 3D maze, presented in the same first-person perspective as the Saving Princess Momoko game, though with a stark blue and white appearance. The goal is to simply find the way out.</desc>

Unlike the other Nazoler Land disks, this one does not contain a series of different mini-games, but rather a single game focusing on a trivia quiz. The player must visit various locations around Japan in an effort to "battle" various trivia masters, and beat all eight of them in order to claim the title as the Quiz King. The game was only released in Japan, and has never been translated from Japanese. As a result, a high level of Japanese knowledge is required to play this game.</desc>

		<name>19: Neunzehn</name>
		<desc>The heir to the throne is shared by four brave people: Darius, Simon, Thales, and Sonia. The 19 gods of Olympus left behind an omnipotent stone to the great emperor Achilles, who has ordered a search to be conducted for the stone. You take the role of one of these four in an effort to find the stone on the island before the rest, waging war with opponent armies to prevent them from finding it first.
19 is somewhat unique among turn based strategy games, in that turns are taken in real time, following rules that are reminiscent of the Japanese chess-like game known as Shogi. The game takes place on an overworld map, on which players take turns moving troops. When opposing troops vi for the same location, the game switches to a zoomed-in combat screen, showing each individual member of the opposing forces. While the story of the game revolves around finding a stone, there is no actual stone to discover. Your only goal is to wipe out the armies of the other three opponents.</desc>

		<name>Omoikkiri Tanteidan HaadoGumi : Matenrou no Chousenjou</name>
		<desc>Based upon a Japanese television series that aired in 1987. It features a group of five detective kids on a mission to retrieve various objects stolen by a mysterious thief who wears a golden mask. The group counts the leader Hiroshi, the cute and Aikido expert Yasuko who also happen to be the only girl of the group, Susumu, Satoru and Takeo. The mysterious thief uses many ingenious tricks to escape his pursuers, such as a huge and colorful air-balloon.
Before getting to the main portion of the game, the player must pass the organization's test. After entering personal information such as name, birth-date and blood type, the player must go through two challenges. The first one is a memory test. Eight character faces (from a list of four) appear at random on the screen and the player needs to remember the order in which they came in. The second test is action based and the player must catch roses thrown by the thief, himself hanging from an air-balloon. Once the tests are passed, the real game starts. Our hero can move around town and visit buildings to gather information. He can also use various items such as a slingshot, a metal detector, a radio, binoculars etc. Baddies also wander around the city and must be avoided. They can also be knocked down using any weapon our hero may carry (like the slingshot) or by punching them on the chin.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots. When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Between some stages one of three intermission animations plays. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, he loses a life. Whenever Pac-Man occupies the same tile as an enemy, he is considered to have collided with that ghost. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. 

Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Pac-Man lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction.</desc>

		<desc>The game is based on standard pachinko rules, replicating the experience of playing pachinko in a parlor. The game board has a layout with nails sticking out. Metal balls would either of or fall in between the holes created by the pegs in order to traverse the board. Certain compartments are added to the board. Should a metal ball find its way to one of these compartments, the player will receive points that are similar to credits on a slot machine.[3] Players can expect to lose that ball (and a point) if it falls below the bottom of the board (similar to falling down a bottomless pit in an action game). Initially, the player starts off with one hundred balls.</desc>

		<name>Patlabor : The Mobile Police, Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo!</name>
		<desc>Patlabor - The Mobile Police - Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo is an action-platformer-shooter game from Bandai and yet another licensed game from the publishing giant. In this case, it is an adaptation of the anime and manga of the same name.

Patlabor is a portmanteau of "patrol" and "labor", with labor being the common name for technologically advanced mechanical walkers used by various construction companies to perform heavy-duty work that a human wouldn't be capable of achieving on their own. Because more and more of these labors are being hijacked by criminals, an equally powerful force of police-issued labors are commissioned and manned by members of the police force. The show follows Section 2 of the Mobile Police Patlabor division in particular.

The game is divided between side-scrolling platformer/run-and-gun levels and first-person shooter modes in which the player character, in their patlabor, must keep the peace by subduing criminals and other villains, some of which have their own labors.</desc>

Play will move to the first screen if the ball falls through the bottom of the top screen and will return to the top screen if the ball is hit back through the space at the top of the first screen. The player controls the flippers on either screen to deflect the ball to keep it from falling off the bottom of the lower screen.</desc>

		<name>Pro Golfer Saru : Kage no Tournament</name>
		<desc>Pro Golfer Saru: Kage no Tournament is a golf game with fantasy elements thrown in, developed by Bandai and published on the Family Computer Disk System in 1987. The game is based on a manga (Japanese comic book) known as Pro Golfer Saru published by Fujiko Fujio (also responsible for Doraemon) about a young cave man or neanderthal-like boy who desires to become the greatest golfer in history. To accomplish this goal, he trains in the most desolate of locations, driving golf balls over giant chasms in an effort to hit greens several hundred meters away.

The game is composed of a training mode as well as the tournament challenge. The first nine holes replicate the desolate, and almost prehistoric locations that Saru normally trains in. Balls must be driven over wide spaces in order to stay in bounds and continue play. The back nine holes take place is a more modern, and even slightly futuristic locale, where Saru must sink balls from across rooftops. The game will save one players performance to disk. It was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

(Note: The referee's count is broken only after both wrestlers have re-entered the ring. That is, as long as at least one wrestler is outside the ring, the referee's count continues. Moreover, it is possible for a wrestler to be counted out while executing a "plancha" if he has crossed the ring ropes by the count of 20.</desc>

		<desc>Professional Mahjong Gokuu is the third game for the Famicom to be based on Mahjong, the competitive tile game popular in China and Japan. It is a four-person version of the game, which is generally how the game is played in real life, though uncommon in simulations during this era due to the additional computing power needed for three AI opponents.

As a "professional" Mahjong game, there is an opportunity to play a mode where the player can gamble on outcomes beforehand. The amount of cash gained or lost is usually based on the quality of the winning hand, but occasionally the player can also make bets to increase their take should they win (though, of course, any money gambled in this way is lost if someone else wins the hand).</desc>

		<name>Pulsar no Hikari : Space Wars Simulation</name>
		<desc>Pulsar no Hikari ("Pulsar of Light"): Space Wars Simulation is a game for the FDS created by computer game developer Soft Pro International. It's a rather dense strategic space simulator that has the player control a starship as it explores a galaxy and fights off enemy ships. The player needs to keep an eye on various pieces of information, such as their energy and their destination, and ensure they don't accidentally wander into an area with pulsars or black holes, or off the galaxy map all together.

Exploration in Pulsar no Hikari seems to follow a set course of scanning nearby space, moving into the next region once it's been ascertained with the long-range scanners that there are no insurmountable obstacles to be encountered there, destroy any asteroids or enemy ships that might be prowling around by checking the short-range scanners and then long-range scan/warp to the next area. Once the ship's energy/fuel is low (combat and movement will steadily drain it), the player should return to the closest star base for refuelling. Smaller star bases can refuel the ship's standard energy unit, but damage and lost ammo (the torpedoes, of which the ship has a finite amount) must be recovered at the major bases.

Accidentally warping to a location with a black hole will instantly end the game. It's generally considered a bad idea.</desc>

		<name>Putt Putt Golf</name>
		<desc>Putt Putt Golf by Pack-In-Video is one of many golf games for the Famicom and the Famicom Disk System, but one of the few to take players through an abstract world rather than an approximation of a real golf course. The goal of each stage is to reach the hole on the green and pot the ball in as few strokes as possible, but each of the courses are covered with various obstacles - some animated, some stationary. The player must navigate around them (or use them to their advantage, in some cases) in order to achieve the best score.</desc>

		<desc>Radical Bomber!! Jirai-kun FDS is a strategy game developed and published by Jaleco for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. The environment of the game resembles a giant board game where each player moves from one space to another. The goal of Radical Bomber is to carefully think out a plan of action and find a way to trap the opponents by removing connections between each "square" on the map. Successfully isolating an opponent from the rest of the board causes them to forfeit the game. If you manage to isolate every every opponent, Jirai-kun will advance the next level. This game was only released in Japan, and has never been translated from its original Japanese language.</desc>

The HELL forces quickly enslaved human beings, and the earth was cast in darkness and despair. Somewhere on the planet, a fortress was built to harness the power of the sun in order to defeat the forces of HELL, should they ever come to our planet, but it fell into ruin after centuries of neglect. The Shining Princess of HEAVEN was captured and imprisoned on the top floor of this fortress. Also inside are the spirits of the Holy Warriors of Light who have the power to defeat the forces of HELL. However, they are asleep and unable to awaken. Earth's only hope is you, a being who has sacrificed his body in order to inhabit the fallen bodies of the departed. To succeed, you must use each body to obtain the key words which are found in, and used to open, the dungeons of the fortress.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/FDS/Replicart (Japan).fds</path>
		<name>Replicart</name>
		<desc>The game takes place at the end of the 21st century. A gigantic snake-like alien called Sonada invades Earth and constructs a base under the soil. Sonada attacks various locations, stealing precious resources, and appears invulnerable to all forms of modern offenses. Engineers regroup and construct a base where a new weapon can be developed. They create the Replicart in the image of Sonada, and give it the power to convert resources into new material that can extend the Replicart and increase its strength until it reaches enough power to destroy the invader.

Replicart is to the original Snake game what Arkanoid is to Breakout; an upgrade that takes the core features of the game and expands upon them by adding enemies, power-ups and more elaborate play settings. In it you must move a robotic snake through mazes in an effort to collect a required number of pieces before the exit will open. The snake's length extends by one unit for every piece collected. If the snake's head touches any of the walls, enemies or its own body, it is destroyed and the player loses one life.

The conversion to the Famicom Disk System by Taito is quite different than the MSX2 original. The number of levels has been reduced to 100, but between every 10 levels, a boss battle occurs in which the player must chase a monster around the screen and blast it until the monster takes enough damage. A bonus level is provided for the player after each boss is defeated before they progress to the next level.</desc>

In the game, you control a protagonist that you name, but the game also stars Risa Tachibana, a popular Japanese singer around the time of the game's release. Together with Risa, your goal is to defeat a witch of darkness by obtaining several key items. Six of Risa's songs are interwoven into the adventure, and the lyrics can provide clues to the proper solution of the game, which is divided into four chapters. At times, a telephone number would appear on the screen, and a telephone service was established for a limited time so that players could call the numbers to get more clues. At times, use of the microphone on the second Famicom controller is required to make progress in the game.</desc>

		<name>Roger Rabbit</name>
		<desc>Help Roger Rabbit collect hearts in various levels and save Jessica Rabbit while avoiding the dastardly weasels! This was eventually released in the US as Bugs Bunny's Crazy Castle and changed the hearts to carrots and the weasels into various characters from Looney Tunes. This was due to Kemco losing the rights to Roger Rabbit in the US.

While presented in a side-scroller format, Roger Rabbit differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Roger Rabbit did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Roger avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects.</desc>

		<name>Samurai Sword</name>
		<desc>Samurai Sword is an adventure game developed and published by Capcom for the Famicom Disk System in Japan towards the end of 1988. The player is an unnamed hero who is promptly defeated by the game's antangonist Soron and whisked away before the moment of his demise in order to find a way to counter Soron's considerable magical might.

While the game may resemble an RPG at first, it is actually a traditional Famicom adventure game, similar to Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom. The player can select from a set of commands for the hero to follow such as looking around, talking to NPCs, picking up items and so on. While there are battles, they can only be resolved by finding the right command (often the right spell) rather than the standard RPG method of exchanging blows governed by various statistics.</desc>

		<desc>SD Gundam World Gachapon Senshi - Scramble Wars is a hybrid strategy/action game based on the popular Gundam toy series from Japan. It was developed and published by Bandai for the Famicom Disk System. Two different versions were released within two months of one another. The initial version was sold in stores for ¥3,300 at the end of 1987 on its own disk with a case. The second version was sold for a much cheaper ¥500 in the beginning of 1988 as part of the "Disk Writer" system, where players could bring their own blank disks to a kiosk and have a game of their choice written to the disk. While both versions contain 10 maps to play on, the Disk Writer edition replaces five of the maps from the original edition with new designs. "Gachapon Senshi" means toy capsule warrior, as the gachapon toy capsule was a popular format for fans of the series to buy super-deformed versions of their favorite Gundam characters.</desc>

		<desc>An expansion of sorts for SD Gundam World Gachapon Senshi - Scramble Wars which plays just like the original but includes 5 new maps to play on.

While the game is considered memorable, especially for being the first in a long line of SD Gundam World games to come, the single-player experience is known for having considerable flaws and a high level of difficulty. While one could forgive the long load times common among the Famicom Disk System games, it was much harder to overlook the exaggeratedly long periods of time that the computer AI took to plan out its moves. This could range from thirty seconds to a several minutes just for one of the three possible commands. Additionally, entering into combat against the computer was a difficult challenge, as the computer opponent played with lightning fast reactions that human players could not compete with without an exceptional amount of practice. It was, however, possible to trick the computer into trapping itself against obstacles on the right maps.</desc>

		<name>Section-Z</name>
		<desc>An enemy space fortress of the Balangool Empire is approaching Earth. Captain Commando has to infiltrate it and find his way to Section-Z to destroy L-Brain, the computer controlling the fortress.
Secton-Z is a side-scrolling game in which the player is a space soldier who can land on the ground and other platform structures and run along them. It is one of the first games which gives players the ability to not only shoot forward, but backwards. It is also one of the first games to give players a choice of paths at the end of each level. Depending on which path they took, they could get special weapons or bombs which wouldn't show up if the other path was taken. To compensate for this, the path without the weapon is often easier. They can activate these special weapons by pressing Select.
Sometimes, one of the paths will be flashing red instead of the usual yellow. This indicates that it is impassable unless the player locates and destroys the Generator Boss that is creating the field. Therefore, it is imperative to find the right paths through the fortress to get to the Generator and blow it up. Once this is done, it is possible to safely pass through the red gates and move onto the rest of the area, and eventually, the area boss. Each time a generator is destroyed the player will earn a capsule that increases total HP.</desc>

		<name>Seiken: Psycho Calibur</name>
		<desc>Many years ago there was a country called Earth Maral. One day it was invaded by the forces of the Dark World and torn apart. People lived in fear, there only hope a legend?nn'A hero holding a sword will appear and restore peace to our land once again.'nnNo one knew when this hero would arrive?nnSaid the devil beast: "What's that? You challenge me? I see. Very well then. I accept your challenge. However, you will never win!"nnSeiken Psycho Calibur: Maju no Mori Densetsu is an adventure game for the Famicom Disk System, developed by Imagineer and published in 1987. It is part of the Wave Jack series of games produced by Imagineer that come with more accessories than the average video game, including a story book and audio cassette tape.
Seiken Psycho Calibur is, in many ways, an attempt to copy the success of The Legend of Zelda. However, it fails to inspire the same level of wonder and fascination. It also lacks a good degree of polish that made the afore mentioned title so great. Nevertheless, Seiken Psycho Calibur is a relatively fun game to play, as long as you have a fair degree of insight into how the game is played. There are some unintuitive aspects of the game that can make progress in the game quite difficult.
For example, you begin the game in a town which offers a variety of goods for sale, but you only receive so much money, and you can never return to the town once you leave. Therefore, what you decide to invest your money in has a substantial impact on the difficulty of the game early on. Many items can be bought for less money later on, but only if you know the location of the hidden shops that contain them. Other less obvious points in the game require a bit of back tracking from later areas to earlier areas in order to acquire items that allow you to proceed, and boss battles that are at times incredibly difficult.</desc>

		<desc>Gal's Dungeon is an adult unlicensed Famicom Disk System game by Super Pig/Hacker International.You play as private eye Kogorou Kurachi, tasked with rescuing the daughter of a crime syndicate boss from the mysterious "Phantom of 40 Faces". It's a 3D dungeon game, similar to the mazes in Wizardry and other terrible computer RPGs, where you progress through eight floors of the villain's master hideout to the thrilling final showdown!
Each floor has a female guardian, whom you must play rock-paper-scissors against. If you win, you get the key to the next floor. You can pick up maps and compasses to guide your way, but always be wary for hidden traps and secret clues!
Kogorou Kurachi is the designers' little parody of the Japanese fictional detective Kogoro Akechi, often considered the Japanese counterpart to Sherlock Holmes. His most frequent nemesis was the master criminal, the Fiend with Twenty Faces. So there's some history for you.</desc>

		<name>Silviana : Ai Ippai no Little Angel</name>
		<desc>Sylviana lived with her mom in relative peace after her father passed away. One day, her mom came down with a mysterious illness. Despite everything Sylviana tried, her mother's condition only got worse. Then one day, she heard a rumor about a Dr. Doppler, who can create a medicine that will cure any disease. She decides to head out and find this Dr. Doppler, and convince him to give her the medicine. However, she soon finds out that the doctor is unable to help her, due to having had his eight treasures stolen from him by demons. Sylviana vows to return the treasures to him in exchange for the medicine.
The game borrows it's combat system from games like Hydlide and Ys: Ancient Ys Vanished, where damage is inflicted upon (and exchanged with) enemies by crashing into them. However, there are no levels or experience points, so Sylviana's power only grows by virtue of the improved equipment that she purchases or finds. Throughout the game, the player wanders around a world map in order to find towns where goods may be purchased, and caves or towers which must be explored to find treasure. Eventually, the player enters a cave and steps through a mirror to enter the mirror image of the original world map, with increased difficulty.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/FDS/Smash Ping Pong (Japan).fds</path>
		<name>Smash Ping Pong</name>
		<desc>Smash Ping Pong simulates the game of ping-pong or table tennis in a remarkably different manner than prior simulations of any variety of tennis. Rather than putting the emphasis on precise control and placement of the paddle in order to return the ball, the emphasis is on timing and strategic control of the ball's speed and trajectory. The player sees no other on-screen representation of themselves beyond a hand holding a paddle. The hand and the paddle automatically move left and right to match the horizontal position of the ball. Players need only concern themselves with the timing of their paddle swing, and the style of swing to use. Players can choose between three different swings, along with the choice of forehand or backhand. 

The Famicom Disk System conversion was developed by Konami, and published directly by Nintendo as Smash Ping Pong. As a result,Konami's penguin mascot Pentarou was replaced by Diskun, the Famicom Disk System mascot, on the title screen, and Donkey Kong Jr. appears in the stands on the right side. The conversion offers several variations of play, including one or two player games, plays to 11 or 21 points, and five levels of difficulty. Additionally, Deuce win conditions do not end at 15 points, but can climb as high as 99 points.</desc>

		<desc>The main character, named Dana, is sent to retrieve "Solomon's Key" to restore the world to light from demons that were accidentally released. The object of the game is to advance through the 50 rooms of "Constellation Space" by acquiring a key to the door that leads to the next room before a timer runs out. The game incorporates elements of the platform shooter genre. Dana can run, jump, create or destroy orange blocks adjacent to him as well as create fireballs to destroy demons. The orange blocks can also be destroyed by hitting them with the character's head twice. Along the way Dana can acquire items to upgrade his firepower and extra lives as well as items that award bonus points and unlock hidden rooms. With certain items, Dana must make, then break blocks (sometimes in a certain manner) to make these appear.</desc>

Super Boy Allan is the second game in Sunsoft's "Intelligence Game" edutainment series for the Famicom Disk System, featuring two different game modes.

The first game mode, which is also the main game, the player has to avoid contact with enemies and push logs in order to solve math-based problems to get extra items. Solving math problems also increases your ability to move several logs at once, which is needed to make further progress.

The second, and much simpler game mode, has the player to finish a 39-steps marathon run by correctly answering simple math questions to accumulate as many points as possible.</desc>

		<name>Super Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>Douglas E. Smith's Lode Runner was introduced to Japan in 1983 on various popular Japanese home computer platforms, including the MSX, Sharp X1, and NEC PC family computers. Hudson Soft licensed the rights to bring the game to Nintendo's Famicom, and it was released in 1984 as one of the first 3rd party games ever made for the system and it was an incredible hit. Around the same time, Irem licensed the rights to produce an arcade version of Lode Runner which they also released in 1984, along with three other sequels through 1986. These arcade versions made a few tweaks to the original game play, and the final arcade game introduced a two player cooperative mode.

In 1987, Irem decided to package a number of select stages from all four of the arcade games into one title, and released it in disk format for the Famicom Disk System, entitled Super Lode Runner. Though the graphics were not quite as good as the arcade games, they were close, and Irem brought many of the game play changes to Famicom players, including the new two player mode. Irem released a sequel later on that same year. A different version of the game was released for the MSX with the same title.</desc>

Irem created four Arcade versions of the original Lode Runner, each with a unique set of levels as well as added features like a co-operative mode for two players. For the FDS home versions, Irem compiled several levels from each of these Arcade versions onto one disk.

		<desc>Originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros.® 2, this game has previously made only brief cameo appearances in the Western hemisphere. Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if that?s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game?s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just don?t be surprised if she?s in another castle!</desc>

		<desc>Originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros.® 2, this game has previously made only brief cameo appearances in the Western hemisphere. Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if that?s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game?s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just don?t be surprised if she?s in another castle!</desc>

		<name>Tama &amp; Friends : 3 Choume Daibouken</name>
		<desc>The game is based on a manga and anime for children of the same name that concerns the cats and dogs of a close-knit neighborhood. 



The game has a subtitle: 3 Choume Daibouken. The "3 Choume" part refers to the district in which Tama and his friends live, while "Daibouken" simply means "great adventure".



As a game, Tama and Friends is very basic, and quite clearly meant for very young children. The goal is to simply walk right across a suburban environment while avoiding enemies like birds and random flying junk. Tama can also climb telegraph poles to help him get higher, which occasionally lead to bonus areas, and there are also bosses to be fought at the end of certain stages.</desc>

		<desc>Tantei Jinguuji Saburou - Kiken na Futari - Zenpen  (Detective Saburou Jinguuji: Danger For Two, Part 1) is a mystery-adventure game developed by Data East for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. It is the third game of the long standing Tantei Jinguuji Saburou series, following Tantei Jinguuji Saburou: Yokohama-kou Renzoku Satsujin Jiken. In the third mystery, the detective visits a race circuit at the invitation of one of Yulia's friends. A motorcycle racer, Sabin Olsen, crashes at the circuit, but a different racer's body is recovered from the crash site. At the same time, Sabin Olsen, at a hotel, is found where a man he was supposed to meet was killed causing Olsen to be framed as he fled the hotel. Due to memory constraints on the size of the disks, this game was broken up into two parts. This is the first part, while the second part, Tantei Jinguuji Saburo: Kiken na Futari Kouhen, was release a few months later.</desc>

		<desc>Tantei Jinguuji Saburou - Shinjuku Chuuou Kouen Satsujin Jiken  ("Detective Saburo Jinguuji: Shinjuku Central Park Murder Mystery") is the first in a long-running series of crime-themed adventure games from Data East regarding the detective Saburo Jinguuji, or Jake Hunter as he is known in the West.

As with all the games that follow, the goal of the game is to discover the perpetrator behind a murder by talking to witnesses and suspects, gathering clues and deducing facts about the case. The player can use a menu of options with which to control Detective Jinguuji's investigation, such as "Talk" and "Look" commands to get a better sense of the world of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Tarot Uranai (Lit. Tarot fortune telling) is a fortune telling simulation developed and published by Scorpion Soft for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. During play, the game predicts the player's future in several areas, including love, finance, and education. It followed a series of other astrological "utility" programs for the platform, including Chuugoku Senseijutsu and '89 Dennou Kyuusei Uranai.

The game focuses on the Tarot deck and their supposed clairvoyant properties. The game will randomly shuffle a deck and lay them out in a formation of the player's choosing - each formation is meant to predict a different aspect of the player's life. The game will then reveal cards that the player chooses and decipher the meaning behind them.</desc>

		<name>Time Twist : Rekishi No Katasumi De... - Zenpen</name>
		<desc>Time Twist: Rekishi no Katasumi de... is an adventure game for the Famicom Disk System in which the protagonist is a disembodied ghost trying to track down his body, which has been taken over by a time-travelling demon. The demon is wrecking havoc across various points in history and the player, as the boy's spirit, has to try and stop it. The player has at their disposal the unique ability to possess various animals and people as well as the usual set of menu-driven commands common to Famicom adventure games.

Time Twist was created by Pax Softnica and Nintendo themselves, using much of the same staff that worked on the two Famicom Mukashi Bunashi (Famicom Fairy Tale) games: Shin Onigashima (New Oni Island) and Yuyuuki (Brave Spirits).

Time Twist would also be the very last game developed by Nintendo for the Famicom Disk System peripheral and was also the last packaged game to be sold for the device. Later games for the peripheral would be sold entirely through the Disk Writer service. Time Twist itself would eventually be sold via the Disk Writer service as well, as packaged versions were in short supply and have since become something of a collector's item as a result.</desc>

The game is slightly famous for its instruction booklet which contains a short manga-style story. Despite the fact that most Famicom users at this time were children, this manga story features the protagonist in a shower scene. The game was never released outside of Japan, nor was it ever translated from Japanese.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/FDS/Tobidase Daisakusen (Japan) (Famicom 3D System).fds</path>
		<name>Tobidase Daisakusen</name>
		<desc>Tobidase Daisakusen was developed by Square in 1987 and was published by DOG, a now-defunct label of Square. The North American release, which was the first Square game to reach American shores, was published by Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. for the NES under the name The 3-D Worldrunner.

The gameplay can best be described as an attempt to merge Super Mario Bros. game mechanics with Space Harrier's third person perspective. In the game, the player assumes the role of Jack, a wild "space cowboy" on a mission to save various planets overrun by serpent-like beasts. The game takes place in Solar System #517, which is being overrun by a race of aliens known as Serpentbeasts, who are led by the evil Grax. As WorldRunner, the player must battle through eight planets to destroy Grax. For its time, the game was technically advanced; the game's three dimensional scrolling effect is very similar to the linescroll effects used by Pole Position and many racing games of the day.

Part of the appeal and selling point of 3-D WorldRunner was its "3-D mode," and it was the first of three games by Square to feature such an option (the other two being JJ, the sequel to 3-D WorldRunner, and Rad Racer). When the 3-D mode is selected, the game uses computer image processing techniques to combine images from two slightly different viewpoints into a single image, known as anaglyph images. The game was packaged with cardboard "anaglyph glasses," which use red and cyan color filters to moderate the light reaching each eye to create the illusion of a three dimensional image.

Tobidase Daisakusen was designed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, Nobuo Uematsu, and Nasir Gebelli, all whom would later rise to fame as core members of the team behind the popular RPG Final Fantasy. The three also developed JJ - Tobidase Daisakusen Part II, the sequel to 3-D WorldRunner.</desc>

		<desc>Tooyama no Kinsan Space Chou - Mr. Gold is a graphical text adventure game developed by Toei Animation for the Famicom Disk System, and published in Japan in 1988. The game is based on an anime OVA "Tooyama Sakura Uchuu Chou - Yatsu no Na wa Gold" (or simply Samurai Gold) which in turn is loosely based on real-life samurai Tooyama Kagemoto. Mr. Gold is a sci-fi adventure about a hero with a cherry blossom tattoo who fights crimes across the cosmos. This character archetype is usually contributed to fictional adaptations of the Tooyama Kagemoto legend, though rarely with a Ziggy Stardust sci-fi theme.The game plays much like any other NES text adventure: The player is presented with a window of what the main character can see and is given options in various menus for what the player can do at any given moment, such as pick up nearby objects or talk to nearby people. Much of the game is spent following co-ordinates to different locations and discovering where to go next.</desc>

		<name>Transformers : The Headmasters</name>
		<desc>Transformers: The Headmasters is a 1987 Family Computer Disk System game by Takara based on the popular cartoon series of the same name and released only in Japan. The game stars the Autobot Headmasters as the protagonists and playable characters. The game is infamous for its high level of difficulty and off-key background music.

You play as one of the Autobot Headmaster through four planets, fighting the Decepticons. Unlike it predecessor, Transformers: Convoy no Nazo, players cannot switch between robot and vehicle mode. Instead, each level contains an initial vehicle mode stage, followed by a robot mode stage. Players start out with only Chromedome. They can switch between Autobots at any time, but only if that Autobot has been collected. Players must rescue them throughout the game, as they will be flown in by helicopter in the vehicle mode stage, or found in one of the rooms of the robot mode stage. Since Headmasters was developed for the FDS, it contains a save game feature similar to those found in early The Legend of Zelda and Metroid games.</desc>

		<name>TwinBee</name>
		<desc>TwinBee can be played by up to 2-players simultaneously. The player takes control of a cartoon-like anthropomorphic spacecraft, with Player 1 taking control of TwinBee, the titular ship, while Player 2 controls WinBee. The game controls consists of a joystick and two buttons: one for shooting enemies in the air and the other for dropping bombs to ground enemies (similarly to Xevious).

The player's primary power-ups are bells that can be uncovered by shooting at the floating clouds where they're hidden. If the player continues shooting the bell after it appears, it will change into one of four other colors: the regular yellow bells only grant bonus points, the white bell will upgrade the player's gun into a twin cannon, the blue bell increases the player's speed (for up to five speed levels), the green bell will allow the player to create image copies of its ship for additional firepower, and the red bell will provide the player's ship a barrier that allows it to sustain more damage. The green and red bells cannot be combined together. Other power-ups can also be retrieved from ground enemies such as an alternate bell that gives the player's ship a three-way gun, a star which eliminates all on-screen enemies.

As with other games of the same genre, getting shot by a single enemy bullet will cause the player to lose a life. However, if the bullet only strikes either side of the ship instead, the player's ship will only lose one of its arms. If the player's ship loses both arms, it will lose the ability to throw bombs and the player must wait for an ambulance to arrive. The player must navigate their ship to the ambulance to repair their arms. However, if the player's ship loses both arms for the second time, no ambulance will arrive.

If two players are playing at the same time, they can align their ships vertically or horizontally together to perform more powerful attacks</desc>

		<name>Ultraman : Kaijuu Teikoku no Gyakushuu</name>
		<desc>Ultraman: Kaiju Teikoku no Gyakushu, loosely translated as "Ultraman: Counterattack of the Monster Empire" is a side scrolling platformer developed for the Family Computer Disk System and published by Bandai at the start of 1987. This game is the first Famicom game dealing with Ultraman. Ultraman 2 was a sequel developed as a simulation game, and Ultraman Club: Chikyuu Dakkan Sakusen was developed as an RPG utilizing the "chibi" or super-deformed style of artwork for the characters.

The player controls Hayate, a member of the Science Special Search Party, which protects the earth from invasions of large hostile aliens. He must run across each stage, defeating enemies with his ray gun. He must also collect energy orbs to fill a meter on the screen. When it is full, he can transform himself into the powerful Ultraman. Energy balls can appear under a variety of circumstance, such as beating an enemy or shooting points in space. Just like in the show, you can only be Ultraman for 3 minutes, and you can chop or kick the boss monsters. When only one minute remains, Ultraman will gain access to two secret powers, the Specium Ray, and the Cutting Halo. Once the boss monster is defeated, the stage is cleared.

If all 11 stages are cleared and the player continues, the game will change the character to Dan Moroboshi who can transform into Ultra Seven. Although Ultra Seven's capabilities are the same as Ultraman's, the defensive power of the enemies will be higher. There are two versions of this game, one which was distributed on disk, and one which was distributed through disk writing stations (made available on March 26, 1987) and they feature slightly different background music tunes.</desc>

		<name>Ultraman 2 : Shutsugeki Katoku Tai</name>
		<desc>Ultraman 2: Shutsugeki Katoku Tai!! (Loosely translated as Ultraman 2: Sortie Department Group) is an action game developed by Bandai for the Famicom Disk System and published at the end of 1987. As the title implies, it revolves around the Ultraman series that was popular in Japan. However, rather than making Ultraman the focus of this game, it is the defense support team that goes into action whenever Japan is attacked by a giant monster which gets the majority of the game time.

The game takes place in modern Japan, with a bird's eye view presentation of much of Japan's metropolis. Players must send a team out to search for, and obtain, a cube which permits the defense team to damage monsters when they appear. Once the cube is found, monsters begin to appear and attack the buildings of Japan. The team must deploy vehicles to help aid in the destruction of these monsters until they have all been defeated. If a monster destroys a critical building, the game is instantly over.</desc>

		<name>Volleyball</name>
		<desc>The game enables the player to choose the amount of people on their team, their country and their gender. The countries include the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Cuba, Russia (USR), and Tunisia. 

In the game the player will control their players by using the d-pad, and will use the b button to perform the game's various actions. The a button is not used in Volleyball. On the court there are two rows, 1 and 2. When the ball nears one of the rows, the team members in that row will then be able to be controlled by the player. If you are unable to hit the ball over the net, then the opposing team receives one point. After hitting the ball to the other side, the other team may or may not hit it over. If they don't your team receives one point.

To serve, the player must press the b button, wait for the ball to come back down to them and then press the b button again. When the opposing team serves, you will have to quickly hit it back over. Occasionally when you simply hit the ball, it'll go straight up in the air. If this happens, you'll have to press the b button once more in order to hit it over.</desc>

		<name>Wakusei Aton Gaiden</name>
		<desc>Wakusei Aton Gaiden ("Planet Aton Side-Story") is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up that was created by the Japanese National Tax Agency (Kokuzeichou) in order to teach children and older players about the issues surrounding Japan's bubble economy by way of a sci-fi themed parable. The story concerns the eponymous planet Aton and two young pilots who attempt to save it from some sort of economy-based crisis - one that just so happens to manifests itself as an alien invasion. The game can be played by one or two players, with player one assuming the role of the male pilot Kanta while the second player assumes the role of the female pilot Yuki.

The game was made accessible to players via a system not unlike the Disk Writer service, though presumably as a government-funded game it was made freely available. It is thought that copies were given away at some manner of a Japanese tax awareness convention or from an educational group that went to various schools across the country to lecture students. As with many Disk Writer exclusive games, it is extremely difficult for modern day Famicom collectors to find.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls Mario (or Luigi in two-player mode) and attempts to destroy all of a certain set of objects with a large hammer on each of 100 levels. Mario cannot jump because of the hammer's weight. The player can select any level to start on from the title screen. Each level takes place on a playfield divided into an invisible grid, each space of which can contain one object. Objects include destructible walls, pillars, and ladders, indestructible barrels and ladders, bombs that destroy all connected destructible objects, and various enemies that Mario must avoid. Doors may also exist, which can be opened to cause enemies to move harmlessly into the background. The game also introduced a new character, a construction foreman named Spike (believed to be an early version of Wario), who chases Mario and attempts to disrupt him by knocking down objects and causing him to fall to the bottom of the playfield. The player starts the game with five lives and loses a life whenever Mario comes in contact with an enemy or fireball. The game is over when all lives are lost. The game can also be aborted at any time, and must be aborted if Mario becomes trapped in a barrel.</desc>

It's a 3D dungeon game, similar to the mazes in Wizardry and other terrible computer RPGs, where you progress through eight floors of the villain's master hideout to the thrilling final showdown!
Each floor has a female guardian, whom you must play rock-paper-scissors against. If you win, you get the key to the next floor. You can pick up maps and compasses to guide your way, but always be wary for hidden traps and secret clues!
Kogorou Kurachi is the designers' little parody of the Japanese fictional detective Kogoro Akechi, often considered the Japanese counterpart to Sherlock Holmes. His most frequent nemesis was the master criminal, the Fiend with Twenty Faces. So there's some history for you.</desc>

		<desc>In Youkai Yashiki, you control a boy armed with a flashlight who must explore five stages and locate five talisman before locating and gaining access to a stage boss. The flashlight serves as a weapon against the monsters which inhabit each stage. Your life meter takes the form of a set of batteries. As your life diminishes, the batteries drain and the power of your flashlight, that is the distance that the beams can travel, decreases.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/FDS/Yume Koujou - Doki Doki Panic (Japan) (DV 1).fds</path>
		<name>Yume Koujou Doki Doki Panic</name>
		<desc>Yume Koujou Doki Doki Panic  (translated as "Dream Factory: Heart-Pounding Panic") is a Japan-only video game developed by Nintendo in cooperation with Fuji Television for the Family Computer Disk System to promote its event called Yume Koujou '87 (translates to Dream Factory '87).

It was later released outside of Japan in an altered format under the name Super Mario Bros. 2, since the original Japanese Super Mario Bros. sequel, Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, was deemed too similar to the original and too difficult for overseas players. Eventually, the altered Mario version of Doki Doki Panic was released in Japan as well, under the title Super Mario USA. 

The story starts with two chidren, the young twins Piki and Poki, peacefully reading a story book. However, they accidentally tear off the last page of the book - little did they know that the book is actually magic! The evil Mamu suddenly appears, and his huge three-fingered hand pulls them into a quirky dream world. 

The goal of Doki Doki Panic is to help the whole family (namely Imajin, Lina and their parents Mama and Papa) rescue their poor children kidnaped by the evil king lizard. Each member has its own strengths and weaknesses - Imaji is a balanced character whereas Lina is fairly light weight and can effortlessly hover and fly over short distances, but she is really slow at picking up items. Papa is the strongest of the group and can throw enemies and items really far, whereas Mama can jump higher than anyone. As aforementioned, each character can carry enemies, items, and especially radishes and other vegetables that can be pulled out of the ground and used as lethal weapons. The game features a myriad of other items, such as bombs (self explanatory), Power blocks (similar to Mario Bros's POW blocks that kill all enemies on screen), Stars (temporary invincibility), keys (to unlock doors), Hearts (extra health) or the mysterious magic lamps that open doors to the Dark World - mirror areas where our heroes can find special items or heart containers. 

Doki Doki Panic follows a story book structure, and is made out of seven chapters (areas) and twenty pages (levels). Interestingly, although the player can play the Doki Doki Panic with any character, it has to eventually defeat the evil Mamu with all four to finally beat the game (the player can separately save each character's progress).</desc>

		<name>Yuu Maze</name>
		<desc>Yuu Maze ("Maze Play") is a single-screen maze game akin to Namco's classic Pac-Man and its many other imitators in that the goal of the game is to drive the futuristic vehicle around a maze collecting dots while avoiding (or temporarily eliminating) the enemies. Taito, one of the largest manufacturers of Arcade games at the time (not to mention the creators of Space Invaders), would produce similarly Arcade-reminiscent games for the system in order to tap into the portion of the market nostalgic for classic Arcade experiences.Yuu Maze adds a few innovations to the format: Each maze has a different structure, different enemies and different lay-outs for the pellets that are required to complete the level; the player can find power-ups which grant weapons, shields and speed-ups to their vehicle. The player's vehicle also has some degree of inertia: There's a slight delay when attempting to accelerate after stopping or performing a U-turn, but if the player keeps moving and changes direction only at 90 degree intervals, they can keep moving at their maximum speed. This is often necessary to keep ahead of the fast moving enemies.</desc>

The player must fight through twelve levels and destroy the System and its defenses. The objective is to shoot down enemies and projectiles and accumulate points. Players start with three lives, and they lose a life if they get hit by an enemy or projectile. After losing a life, gameplay continues with the player reappearing on the screen and losing all previously accumulated power-ups; the player remains temporarily invincible for a moment upon reappearing on the screen. The game ends when all the player's lives have been lost or after completing the twelfth and final area. However, the player can earn 1-ups (extra lives) throughout the game by accumulating high point scores. Zanac has a continue option which allows players to restart the game from the level in which they lost all their lives.</desc>

		<name>Zelda no Densetsu : The Hyrule Fantasy</name>
		<desc>A small kingdom in the land of Hyrule, the setting of the game, is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded it and stole the Triforce of Power, a part of a magical artifact bestowing great strength. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, another of the pieces, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is eventually kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, though a young boy named Link appears and rescues her.  After hearing Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda incorporates elements of action, adventure, and role-playing games. The player controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels in the overworld, a large outdoor map with varied environments. Link begins the game armed only with a small shield, but a sword becomes available to Link after he ventures into a cave that is accessible from the game's first map screen. Throughout the game, various characters aid Link by giving or selling equipment and clues. These people can be found in caves scattered throughout the overworld; some are readily accessible, while others are hidden behind obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls

Nintendo originally released the game as the launch title for the Family Computer's new Disk System peripheral. The Legend of Zelda was joined by a re-release of Super Mario Bros., Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Soccer, and Mahjong in its introduction of the Disk System. It made full use of the Disk Card media's advantages over traditional ROM cartridges with a disk size of 128 kilobytes, which was expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of space on the disk, however, it was only in katakana. Rather than passwords, it used rewritable disks to save the game. It used the extra sound channel provided by the Disk System for certain sound effects; most notable are the sounds of Link's sword when his health is full, the roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and enemy death sounds. The sound effects used the Famicom's PCM channel in the cartridge version. It also used the microphone built into the Famicom's controller that was not included in the NES. This led to confusion in the U.S. as the instruction manual reads that Pols Voice, a rabbit-like enemy in the game, "hates loud noise". Blowing or shouting into the Famicom's microphone kills these creatures. However, they cannot be killed through use of the recorder, and on the NES must be killed with weapons.</desc>

It made full use of the Disk Card media's advantages over traditional ROM cartridges with a disk size of 128 kilobytes, which was expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of space on the disk, however, it was only in katakana. Rather than passwords, it used rewritable disks to save the game. It used the extra sound channel provided by the Disk System for certain sound effects; most notable are the sounds of Link's sword when his health is full, the roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and enemy death sounds. The sound effects used the Famicom's PCM channel in the cartridge version. It also used the microphone built into the Famicom's controller that was not included in the NES. This led to confusion in the U.S. as the instruction manual reads that Pols Voice, a rabbit-like enemy in the game, "hates loud noise". Blowing or shouting into the Famicom's microphone kills these creatures. However, they cannot be killed through use of the recorder, and on the NES must be killed with weapons.</desc>

		<desc>A small kingdom in the land of Hyrule, the setting of the game, is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded it and stole the Triforce of Power, a part of a magical artifact bestowing great strength. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, another of the pieces, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is eventually kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, though a young boy named Link appears and rescues her.  After hearing Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda incorporates elements of action, adventure, and role-playing games. The player controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels in the overworld, a large outdoor map with varied environments. Link begins the game armed only with a small shield, but a sword becomes available to Link after he ventures into a cave that is accessible from the game's first map screen. Throughout the game, various characters aid Link by giving or selling equipment and clues. These people can be found in caves scattered throughout the overworld; some are readily accessible, while others are hidden behind obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls

		<desc>Transylvania enjoyed a century of peace thanks to the legendary hero, Christopher Belmont, a vampire hunter who vanquished Count Dracula one hundred years earlier with a holy whip named Vampire Killer. While the Easter celebration carried on with a grand carnival, evil men gathered in a monastery at the edge of the village and conducted a black mass to resurrect Count Dracula.

The men succeeded in bringing their master back. A bolt of lightning enveloped the monastery where they held the rite, signaling the resurrection of Count Dracula. When the Count returned, his Castle, which had fallen one hundred years prior, reappeared in Transylvania, and his legions of loyal minions reformed.

Simon Belmont, the descendant of Christopher Belmont, knew that as a member of the Belmont Clan and the current wielder of the Vampire Killer whip, it was his duty to bring peace and stability back to Transylvania by destroying Dracula.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2734, the mechanical life form Garemu suddenly attacked five hyperspace navigation broadcasting points, "FIELD". In order to prevent Garem's invasion, the Milky Way alliance has decided to dispatch the mobile weapon Raijin, which you must pilot. Like Square's earlier semi-classic Thexder, the player can opt to change between the two modes of their craft at certain points during each level. Upon touching ground as the mecha, the player is occasionally able to find other directions to continue exploring as a spaceship, presenting both vertical-scrolling and side-scrolling shoot-'em-up sections. There are three items you must find before you complete a level; a star, an orb, a computer, and a bomb. After you collect all of these, it will trigger the boss battle the next time you try to go to the boss area.</desc>

Unlike previous versions of Little Computer People, the playable character is a girl wearing a pink dress and bow in her hair. The rooms of the house are also in a different configuration, featuring an outdoor balcony on the top floor. When the game is first played, a name for the character is chosen at random from a preprogrammed list. There are no winning conditions on this game you basically watch and interact with the girl in various ways. However, Apple Town Story lacks many of the features found in other versions of Little Computer People.</desc>

		<name>Bakutoushi Patton-kun</name>
		<desc>Bakutoushi Patton-Kun is an overhead tank combat game similar in style to Atari's Combat game. It was the first FDS title to allow for four players to play simultaneously. In the game, players attempt to destroy each others tanks. If a tank is destroyed, the driver of the tank will exit the vehicle, and must try to stay alive long enough for a replacement tank to parachute down from the sky. Game play continues until only one tank is the sole survivor. Then players advance to a new stage with different terrain. There are 56 stages in total. Tank stats can also be changed in an Editor mode. Despite referencing the name of American General George S. Patton in the title, there is no mention of him anywhere else throughout the game. Although the game was only release in Japan, the loading screen instructions contain English profanity.</desc>

		<name>Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit</name>
		<desc>Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up in which the player controls a blue helicopter fighting against waves of enemy vehicles and ground turrets. Each mission takes the helicopter to a different part of the world, each with a distinctive if chromatically plain visual style.

The game's power-ups, available by destroying smaller supply trucks driving across the screen, change the helicopter's weapons but do not make them stronger. It's even possible to collect the weaker original weapon again if the player is too careless. These range from a stronger forward-firing cannon (or laser) to guns that spread fire forwards and to the sides of the helicopter.

You can beat it more than once with enemies taking more hits on subsequent playthroughs.</desc>

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games. The dragons can blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. The bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.</desc>

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.</desc>

In Ordola, the actual math puzzles are relegated to an ancillary mini-game found on the disk.

The goal of the game is to help a young explorer pass through the underground world of Ordola, taking out enemies along the way with his bombs. The bombs fly in a specific arc, so the player needs to be the right distance from the enemy in order to hit it. The player character can also crouch, jump, climb ladders and use other abilities common to platformers.</desc>

		<desc>Players explore an Egyptian town and ruins from a first-person perspective. The game combines role-playing game elements with an adventure game-like interface. Players may purchase items from shops, though some shopkeepers must be defeated in battle before trading. Battles are turn-based, with options to fight, use items, or flee. Players accumulate experience points by succeeding in battle and "level up" after gaining enough experience, which increases their stamina. Randomly encountered battles with enemies may happen at any time, including when paused to examine the inventory.

The player character, Daisuke Kusano, is the son of an archaeologist who disappeared while searching for the Tears of Isis, artifacts once owned by Cleopatra. During the man's excavation for the Tears, demons appeared and abducted him. The boy soon learns that he must find the Tears in order to save his father. Over the course of the adventure, Daisuke visits the Great Sphinx of Giza, the Temple of Kom Ombo, a tower of sand, and an underground labyrinth. At the end of the game, he discovers that the demons had been disguised as the kindly shopkeeper. Daisuke receives the last Tear of Isis upon defeating the demons, which summons the ghost of Cleopatra, who releases Daisuke's father from imprisonment.</desc>

Clu Clu Land's story starts with a type of sea urchin, the Unira, stealing all of the treasures in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land. Bubbles, the heroine, sets out to retrieve the treasure. The object of the game is to uncover all the gold ingots in each stage while avoiding the Unira and Black Holes. Ingots usually form a shape such as a heart or a mushroom. The only way Bubbles can turn around to change directions is by means of Turning Posts located throughout the stages. Bubbles can stun the Unira by using a Sound Wave. When they are stunned, Bubbles can push them into a wall to get rid of them and receive points. If Bubbles is hurt by the Unira, she will lose a life. A life is also lost when Bubbles falls into a Black Hole, or when time runs out. The game ends if Bubbles has lost all her lives.</desc>

		<desc>In the space calendar 0385, the Earth suffers from overpopulation and humans started to build space colonies. Kirk, the protagonist of Dead Zone, works for the Earth federation's space development office. He is a brilliant engineer in space physics and he is working for Sirius third planet colony. He also got engaged with his beloved girlfriend Marry, but they had to postpone their wedding. Five months later, Kirk, accompanied with his robot Carry, decides to meet Marry at last, and prepare the ceremony. But when he arrives at the space station, everything is quiet. Then a beam of light hits him. He wakes up sometimes later, inside a sort of underground graveyard, pieces of dismantled robots surrounding him.

The player proceeds through the game by choosing from a selection of text menu commands. Like any traditional digital comic/text adventure games, a large view shows the surroundings. The bottom of the screen proposes simple action commands, like see, take or push; however, the game is entirely in Japanese (although it uses katakana exclusively). One of the original features of the game is to use real sampled sound in some places, which is very unusual for the time.</desc>

Like a few other music games of its kind, it comes complete with a digital keyboard which connects to the Famicom for the purpose of composing and playing music. The inclusion of a large keyboard with the game makes Doremikko the most expensive Famicom Disk System title at the time of its original sale.The title of the game is often mistranslated as "Dreamiko", but it is intended to be a play on the names for the first three notes of a scale; Do, Re, Mi. Having been developed by Konami, the game actually features a medly of Gradius music, and contains a cameo of the Vic Viper on the menu screen. It was only release in Japan, and never translated into any other language.</desc>

		<name>Akumajou Dracula II: Noroi no Fuuin</name>
		<desc>The game's setting takes place seven years after the original Castlevania. The prologue begins when Simon visits his family's resting ground. His back is critically injured from his last encounter with Dracula in the previous game. He suddenly feels someone's presence, and turns to see a young woman standing within the mist. She tells him that a curse was placed upon him by Dracula during their last battle, and that he does not have long to live. The woman continues to say that the curse can be undone if he resurrects Dracula himself. She further explains that Dracula's body was split into five different parts after his defeat seven years ago, and Simon must recover these and bring them to the ruins of Dracula's castle. There, he must seal Dracula and defeat him. Before disappearing, the unknown woman says she cannot guarantee that this will destroy Dracula permanently.

Dracula II - Noroi no Fuuin (Lit. "Dracula II: The Seal of the Curse") is an action-adventure game produced by Konami. It was originally released for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan in 1987, and for the NES in North America in 1988. It is the second Castlevania title released for the NES, following the original Castlevania. Set in 1698, seven years after the events of the first installment, the player once again assumes the role of vampire hunter Simon Belmont, who is on a journey to undo a curse placed on him by Dracula at the end of their previous encounter. Small differences exist between the Japanese version and the American version. Specifically the Japanese version takes advantage of the expanded FM processing capabilities of the FDS hardware to produce better sound, but it contains load scenes when entering or exiting any town or mansion. The FDS version also has three save slots instead of the NES password system.</desc>

		<name>Eggerland: Souzou heno Tabidachi</name>
		<desc>Souzou he no Tabidachi translates to "Departure to Creation." Like with "Revival of the Labyrinth" before, this is a fitting description of the game itself. It references the fact that it brings the Creation Mode from the original back to the series, after it was abandoned in the previous two installments. It further resembles the first title in that it's also one of the most basic entries in the franchise, and among the easiest of the Japanese releases. It's also tied for the shortest game in the entire series, with just fifty puzzles in all. Given that the predecessors all had a hundred or more, this might seems like a problem, but the caliber of the puzzles is as high as ever. So if you found the prequels to be a bit overwhelming, then this might be the best of the early titles to start with. Interestingly, this seems to have been one of the FDS titles that were available solely from Disk Writer machines, as it doesn't appear to have ever been released at retail.</desc>

		<name>Falsion</name>
		<desc>Humanity has colonized most planets in our galaxy, the Milky Way, and they now look towards expanding their reach by using an experimental travel technology called "Hyperzone Drive". However, a race of aliens who have already mastered that technology are currently invading planets at a quick pace, closing in on our solar system. The invaders attack humanity's colony on Pluto and conquer it with little resistance, since human civilization doesn't have the technology to defend itself.

The human organization responsible for the space program, the "United Space Force", decides to use the yet-untested "Hyperzone Drive" in order to send ships that will directly attack the armies of the invading aliens. However, the new technology proves hard to control, and only one of the ships manages to survive the trip: Falsion.</desc>

		<name>Famicom Grand Prix : F1 Race</name>
		<desc>Compete in championships or try to beat your best time in this top-down Formula 1 racing game.

Famicom Grand Prix: F1 Race gives you 10 tracks to race on with either dry or rainy conditions. On top of keeping all four wheels on the road, tire wear, damage, and fuel must be managed to secure victory. Stopping into the pit for maintenance at the right moment can mean the difference between victory and defeat. There are also 24 different cars to purchase with your winnings with varying attributes including speed, fuel efficiency, body strength, and tire endurance.

F1 Race was released as one of Nintendo's Disk Fax line of games. It came on a special blue disk and allowed players to submit their best times through special kiosks in various stores across Japan. Players with the best time were given a chance to win a Super Mario Bros. Game &amp; Watch LCD game.</desc>

		<name>Famicom Grand Prix II : 3D Hot Rally</name>
		<desc>The second game in the Famicom Grand Prix series. In a departure from its predecessor, Famicom Grand Prix II features a behind-the-car view similar to Outrun and Rad Racer. Rather than consisting of a handful of short tracks, 3D Hot Rally provides three long tracks consisting of a variety of different terrain types giving the feel of an actual rally race. Each track has multiple routes to the finish line, requiring you to find the best path to victory. The game features three cars to choose from: the speedy Kattobi coupe, the balanced Yonque truck, or the rugged Monster buggy.



In order to complete a race, players must reach each checkpoint within a certain time limit. If the limit is crossed too late, time is subtracted from their bank. If the time bank is depleted, the race is over. Successfully reaching a checkpoint before the time limit is reached banks extra time. Players can also collect exclamation marks scattered throughout the tracks. Collecting enough exclamation marks to fill the dash meter allows temporary access to the hot dash, a fifth gear that greatly increases speed. Before each race, you're asked to place a repair point somewhere on the track, allowing you to repair any damage done to your car, so long as you pick a route that leads you past that checkpoint. Taking too much damage puts you out of the race.



As the name implies, 3D Hot Rally allows you to use the Famicom 3D System glasses to give the race a real feeling of depth. It also challenged players to submit their best times via Famicom Disk Fax kiosks located in various stores for a chance to win a Disk-kun stationary set.</desc>

The couple had no children, until one day, they were entrusted with the care of an infant boy and girl, as prophesied in a dream. The years went by, and when the two children were 8 years old, there was a terrible occurrence in the western capital. An evil dragon suddenly appeared in the city, turning humans into oni, ogres that suck away the souls of other humans. The oni advanced as far as Nagakushi village, stealing away the souls of the elderly couple. Fortunately the two children were left unharmed, and they set out on a quest to save their adopted parents, not realizing that this adventure would reveal the secret of their true origins...</desc>

		<desc>Famicom Mukashibanashi: Shin Onigashima is a Famicom Disk System text adventure game. The plot revolves around an elderly couple with no children who adopt an infant boy and girl. When the children turn six, a dragon appears in the country, and starts turning people into Oni who steal the souls of others. The Oni arrive at their home and steal the elderly couple's souls. The children decide to save their adoptive parents.

The game is controlled by selecting commands such as the "Change Character" command, which allows you to switch between controlling Donbe (the boy) and Hikari (the girl). The game progress is shown by changes in the in-game graphics. The Famicom Disk System version comes on two disks released on different dates. Disk 2 cannot be played without completing Disk 1, and is switched while the system is still powered on. All later releases are switch-free.</desc>

		<name>Famicom Mukashibanashi : Yuuyuuki, Kouhen</name>
		<desc>Famicom Mukashibanashi: Yuuyuuki ("Famicom Fairy Tales: Yuuyuuki") is the second of two text adventure games in the Famicom Mukashibanashi series developed by Pax Softnica and Nintendo themselves for the Famicom Disk System peripheral. It shares many similarities with its predecessor Shin Onigashima: Both games required two disks that were released separately, both feature an innovative "main character switch" feature that allows the player to switch from two playable characters and both are based on ancient Far Eastern literature. In Yuuyuuki's case the literature in question is the ancient Chinese novel Journey to the West.

The player controls Goku (Sun Wukong) and Chao (an original character) who are travelling separate journeys to meet up with each other. True to the novel, Goku is also accompanying the monk Sanzo (Tripitaka) and his other followers Hakkai (Pigsy) and Gojo (Sandy), though these three characters have been comedically reimagined as lazy and greedy.

As with Shin Onigashima and many adventure games for the system the player directs the player character via a menu of commands. They can talk, examine, pick up and otherwise interact with all sorts of people and items in the surroundings. An ability to switch between Goku and Chao is frequently available as well.</desc>

		<name>Famimaga Disk Vol. 2 : Panic Space</name>
		<desc>Panic Space, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 2 Panic Space, is a puzzle game in which the goal is to reflect a laser to an exit panel in order to open the way to the next stage. The laser cannot hit any of the stage's surrounding wall: were it do so, it would cause the level to explode and the player to lose a life (from an initial allotment of five, though this can be increased while playing the game). Much of the time the various reflectors (which send the beam off at a 90 degree angle) and blocks (which simply stop the laser in its tracks) must be maneuvered into place before the laser should be tested on them.</desc>

		<desc>Janken Disk Jou, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 6 Janken Disk Jou, is a puzzle game in which the protagonist (who looks uncannily like Disk-kun, the mascot of the Famicom Disk System) must brave a labyrinth of puzzles. In each room there are three variants of hand-shaped blocks between the hero and the exit: each one either making the "scissors" gesture, the "rock" gesture or the "paper" gesture. Pushing a block adjacent to another of a different type causes whichever was the inferior (e.g. with paper and rock, rock is the inferior) to vanish. In addition, each block has a "strength" which is signified by its color: green is level 1, yellow is level 2 and red is level 3. If a green block is pushed next to an inferior red block, the red block will instead become yellow instead of vanishing (and then green with a subsequent superior block, and then will vanish after a third).</desc>

		<name>Fire Rock</name>
		<desc>Fire Rock is an action game developed for the Famicom Disk System by System Sacom, and published in Japan by Use in 1988. The design of the game is credited to Mark Flint. In the game, the player controls what appears to be a cave man, whose goal is to navigate a series of item filled caverns in an effort to locate the boss of the level, defeat it, and then locate the door which leads to the next level. The game is commonly sited as having very poor controls, often requiring the player to grab hold of a wall, and very slowly climb it by holding up and tapping jump repeatedly. Other issues include a very low jump that places more platforms and items out of reach, and a difficult time bringing the character back under control if he starts to slip. This game was not released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<desc>Fuuun Shourin Ken: Ankoku no Maou is the sequel to Fuuun Shourin Ken, which was published almost exactly one year prior. Like its predecessor, it features concepts such as a distinction between punch and kick attacks, relative directions, and a health bar for each fighter.



Ankoku no Maou combined the one on one fighting aspect of the game with a visual novel presentation that allowed you to select your next opponent. It also altered the control scheme to something slightly more conventional. All punch attacks are performed with B button while all kick attacks are performed with A button. Pressing both buttons allowed for special actions like leaps and jumping attacks, and blocking was performed by pressing up on the control pad.



In addition to all this, the game also supported the Famicom 3-D System which enabled players to perceive depth in the game by wearing a specially designed headset which placed shutters over either eye extremely rapidly.</desc>

		<name>Gall Force : Eternal Story</name>
		<desc>Based upon the anime of the same name, Gall Force is a group of science fiction anime OAV series by the studio Artmic, with production by Youmex and AIC. The original character designs were by Kenichi Sonoda. In the original story line, an all-out, prehistoric galactic war rages between the all-female Solnoids and the amorphous Paranoids for too long. In the midst of battle, a plan which was secretly hatched by the leaders of both sides comes into fruition, and an unsuspecting crew of seven Solnoid soldiers aboard the Kulanis-class Cruiser named the Star Leaf is caught up in the middle.

The Famicom Disk System game is a top down shooter and follows a different story than that of the OAVs. It features Rabby flying across Terra, and catapulting into six different regions of space in order to rescue each of her crew members one at a time. With each crew member that you rescue, you gain access to a new configuration for your ship.</desc>

Both games feature teams of schoolchildren detectives as they hunt down an elusive thief in a mask and cape.The game follows a sub-genre of Japanese adventure games that include a top-down RPG style world map to walk around on, rather than simply selecting destinations from a menu. Otherwise the game is similar to other NES Portopia/Tantei Club-derived detective adventure games; the player must search for clues, talk to witnesses and suspects and solve inventory-based puzzles in order to proceed.</desc>

		<desc>An update of sorts to Golf. Players get to take control of Nintendo's mascots Mario and Luigi (in the 2 player game) and play over 18 holes of golf on courses modeled after real courses in Japan.

Players can choose to either try their skills in match play or stroke play. Match play involves two golfers trying to win the most holes. They win holes by getting the better score than their competitor. Stroke play differs as it just involves the golfer trying to get the best score possible by completing each hole in as few strokes as possible.

When on the golf course, players can choose the club they want to use, adjust the speed and strength (from a 1 to 3 scale) of their swing, and aim in the direction they want to hit the ball. Hitting the ball involves the use of a meter with an icon that goes back and forth, which gauges the distance the ball is hit. Players can take a step back from the tee and take practice swings so they can get into a rhythm using this meter.

This game also contained a now defunct feature where players could record their personal information and their best scores and then bring the game disk to a Disk Fax machine. Inserting the disk into this machine would fax over the player's information to Nintendo's headquarters. This information was used for a contest. Being selected a contest winner would award the player with a golden colored disk version of this game. This golden disk version of the game contained an exclusive course that was not present on the original version of this game.</desc>

		<name>Goonies</name>
		<desc>The Goonies was developed by Konami in 1986. Naturally, it is based somewhat on the movie of the same name, where a boy named Mikey and his friends discover the treasure of a pirate just in time to prevent their home town from being bought out by greedy land developers. While the game incoporates some of the more identifiable aspects of the movie, it follows a decidedly different plot line, with the gang of Mikey's friend captured by the Frateli family, one of the movie's antagonists. Mikey is therefore required to proceed from stage to stage and rescue them, while exploring labyrinthine dungeons and locating power-up items.  There are six stages in all. Power-ups and diamonds are hidden from sight. To reveal them, players must discover the particular joystick input specific to the stage they are hidden in. After the player completes the stages at the first level of difficulty, the input required for each stage changes in the second level. Many secrets are scattered throughout the game including cameos from the likes of Konamiman, and Twinbee. Even a secret warp can be found in order to bypass one level. Many of the features and items introduced in this version found their way into the more advanced sequel.</desc>

		<name>Green Beret</name>
		<desc>Based on the arcade game of the same name, the player's objective in the FDS version was changed from rescuing prisoners to destroying a secret weapon being developed in the enemy's headquarters. Additionally, a 2-players co-operative mode was introduced as well, allowing two players to play simultaneously (with Player 1 in blue and Player 2 in red). The play mechanics are essentially identical to the arcade version, however the Flamethrower is removed (only the Rocket Launcher and Grenades remained) and two new power-up items are introduced: a Star mark which grants invincibility and a pistol with unlimited ammo, both which are only usable for a limited period. The FDS version also features two additional stages that were not in the arcade game: an airport set between the Missile Base and the Harbor, where the player faces a group of rocket soldiers at the end; and a new final stage set inside the enemy's base in which the player must disarm a nuclear missile at the end that is about to be launched; by using rocket launchers dropped by enemy soldiers. The flamethrower corps at the end of the Warehouse stage was replaced by a paratrooper unit.</desc>

		<name>Gun.Smoke</name>
		<desc>The objective is to free the town of Hicksville from the band of criminals known as the Wingates. But in order to capture their most dangerous henchmen, in each stage the player must retrieve a Wanted sign of said henchman, otherwise it is impossible to clear the stage. In this game, the main character is a bounty hunter named Billy Bob.

Although virtually identical to the NES version, the FDS version featured several differences:

This game, like virtually all other FDS games, feature load times.

The font is similar to what is used in most Capcom games on the Famicom/NES. However, on the NES version, the font is changed to the military-font, also seen in the arcade version.

"In America" is changed to "In 1849".
Bandit Bill's mugshot on the wanted poster is slightly different in both versions of the game. In the FDS version, his shirt has an open collar, with part of his body showing. In the NES version, his shirt has a scarf around it. On top of that, the mugshots for the wanted posters originally had an Anime look, whereas in the NES version, they had a realistic look.

In this version, the shopping music features less instruments. Also, many of the tunes featured in the NES version are nowhere to be found in this version, and instead recycle the same music for certain scenes in the game. This is due to the limited memory space in FDS disk cards.

There is no game demonstration like there is in the NES version.

After beating the game the first two times, the player is rewarded with a Japanese message that tells the player to try the game again. After the third time, the player will be rewarded with a simple message that says "THE END". The Japanese message was thrown out in the NES version, instead of being translated into English.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/QD2FDS/Gyruss (Japan).fds</path>
		<name>Gyruss</name>
		<desc>Gyruss  is a shoot 'em up arcade game designed by Yoshiki Okamoto and released by Konami in 1983. The majority of enemies are spaceships, which must be destroyed to complete a level. They appear either from the centre of the screen or from one of the edges, and move in swirling patterns. They can shoot the player's ship or destroy it by contact. They hover near the centre of the screen after completing their deployment pattern, and occasionally fly outwards and shoot at the player. If not destroyed by the player, the enemy ships gradually fly away one by one.

The gameplay is similar to that of Galaga but presented in a forced 3D perspective, with the player's ship facing 'into' the screen and able to move around the perimeter of an implicit circle. The scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games is arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving through space.

Gyruss was also remade for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America, released by Konami's subsidiary Ultra Games. In these versions of the game, the core gameplay is still largely the same, but there are several major revisions. The game was well received in North America. Revisions include:

Updated graphics

Additional control options

The music from the arcade version of the game was slightly remixed, and several additional tracks composed by Atsushi Fujio, Yuichi Sakakura, and Harumi Ueko were added.

The player starts off at "Three Warps To Neptune" instead of "Two Warps"

The player can use a super phaser attack in addition to the normal guns

There are additional enemies, including boss fights when the player reaches each planet

Bonus stages after each planet's boss is defeated, for a chance to gain additional powerups
    
There is a definite ending to the game. In the NES version, it's a brief text about the Universe being at peace. In the FDS version, there is a full ending sequence with credits.

In addition to the satellites providing the usual double guns and bonus points, they can also provide extra phasers, a smart bomb, and even an extra life

Instead of the arcade's looping 24 stages, there are 39 looping. In the arcade, the player starts from Neptune and proceeds to Earth. On the NES version, the player travels through the entire Solar System, including Neptune, Pluto, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury, and the Sun.

The player can enter the Konami code at the title screen for extra lives, but with a twist: the code must be entered in reverse (A-B-A-B-right-left-right-left-down-down-up-up) instead of in the original sequence.</desc>

		<name>Halley Wars</name>
		<desc>It’s the middle of the 21st century. The armies of Lord Halley are launching attacks on planet Earth. You are the last chance for Earth, piloting a craft specially developed to engage these hordes. You must fight your way through their defenses to the final goal, the alien base. The final battle is about to commence!

Halley Wars is a vertical scrolling shooter. The game has 6 stages set in locations in space such as, above planets or in asteroid fields. There are end of levels bosses at the end of each stage each with their own weaknesses. There are power-ups, which can be picked up along the way when you shoot particular asteroids or satellites. These upgrade your weapon strength, speed, add explosive pods and shields.

Where the game stood out was, there are comets that need to be destroyed on your journey. Each comet and ship that you don’t shoot makes it to earth and does some damage there. Comets do more damage than the enemy ships do. If Earths damage level reaches 100% the game is over. For every 2000 points you score, 1% of Earths damage is repaired.</desc>

		<name>Hikari Shinwa : Palthena no Kagami</name>
		<desc>In a time where humans and gods coexisted in harmony, the kingdom of Angel Land was ruled by two goddesses, Palutena the Goddess of Light and Medusa the Goddess of Darkness. While Palutena administered the light and helped the mortals cultivate their crops, Medusa despised the mortals and used the darkness to destroy their crops and turn the mortals into stone. Enraged, Palutena transformed Medusa into a hideous monster and banished her into the dark Underworld.

But Medusa would not go quietly. She assembled an army of monsters and evil spirits of the underworld to conquer Palutena's home, the Palace in the Sky. War erupted and Medusa's minions overwhelmed Palutena's army, eventually imprisoning the Goddess of Light. Medusa then seized the Three Sacred Treasuresâ€”the Mirror Shield, the Arrow of Light, and the Wings of Pegasusâ€”and gave them to her most powerful minions.

Defeated and imprisoned, Palutena's only hope was to seek the help of Pit, a young angel trapped in the Underworld. Using the last of her strength, she sent Pit a magical bow. Thus, Pit set out on a quest to escape the Underworld, retrieve the Sacred Treasures that would help him defeat Medusa, and rescue Palutena and restore peace to Angel Land.

The original Famicom Disk System versions feature save slots, unlike the North American version which uses a password system (known in-game as "Sacred Words"). As with Metroid, the FDS version of Kid Icarus also features higher-quality music and sound effects that take advantage of the system's additional sound channels.</desc>

		<name>I Am a Teacher : Teami no Kiso</name>
		<desc>I Am A Teacher: Teami no Kiso (roughly "I Am A Teacher: The Basics of Hand-Knitting") is an instructional tool to help would-be knitters create their own garments. The user can input the amount, length and type of wool they have and the size and type of the item of clothing they wish to create and the program will put together a guide to help them achieve this goal.

Unlike Super Mario no Sweater, its predecessor in the I Am A Teacher series, there are no Nintendo characters present in Teami no Kiso. Rather, Teami no Kiso is a guide for teaching the fundamentals of knitting to novices, with Super Mario no Sweater intended for those who already have some experience who wish to try new Mario-themed designs.

As with Super Mario no Sweater, Teami no Kiso was commissioned by major Japanese wool and sewing products manufacturer Royal Kougyou, but it's believed that Nintendo developed and published the game themselves.</desc>

		<desc>The plot is simple: the Condor has stolen the food supply from the neighboring village and takes it to his nest on the mountain nearby. So it's up to Nana and Popo to climb up the ice-covered top of the mountain to get the vegetables back from Condor. You'll do this by hopping up platforms while avoiding various enemies and obstacles before your time runs out.

Interestingly the Famicom Disk System port is actually based on the arcade version Vs. Ice Climber and differs from the console version in ways such as an animated title screen, stage select menu, 16 additional mountains, occasional blizzard and wind effects, more enemy characters, and bonus multiplier items.</desc>

		<name>Ice Hockey</name>
		<desc>The play and mechanics of Ice Hockey are mostly similar to that of ice hockey in real life. The objective for both team is to hit a black puck with a hockey stick that each player carries into the opponent's goal. Teams are made up of five players including the goaltender, as opposed to six in real life. Players wear ice skates, which are used to skate across the icy arena. Each game is made up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking/defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design. If two opposing players fight for the puck for a certain amount of time, other players join into the fight, resulting in the player from the losing team in the fight to be put in the penalty box for a period of time.</desc>

		<name>Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School</name>
		<desc>The game's protagonist enters Tokimeki High School and runs into a girl wearing glasses who looks identical to Miho Nakayama. Though the game is a standard text command-style adventure game similar to the Famicom Tantei Club series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the "game over" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other text adventure games where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a dating simulation rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.</desc>

		<name>Igo : Kyuu Roban Taikyoku</name>
		<desc>Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku is the first real attempt to bring the Japanese board game Go to a home console, namely the Famicom. The game was designed by Henk Rogers, a Dutch programmer who would play games of Go against the CEO (at the time) of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi. It was during one such game that the prospect of developing such a title for the Famicom was discussed. It was later converted from disk format to cartridge and release in August 1987.

Prior to the release of this game, Nintendo had released a game which was played on the Go board in 1983, known as Gomoku Narabe Renju, but the play mechanics were more akin to "Connect Four" (or five, as it were). The real game of Go is traditionally played on a 19 Ã— 19 grid, but the permutations of possibilities would take too long for the Famicom's processor to consider, so the board size has been significantly reduced to a 9 Ã— 9 grid, which allows for a smoother single player experience. The game also features a lesson mode, in which ninjas appear to teach the player about the rules and strategy of the game.</desc>

		<name>Ishidou</name>
		<desc>Ishido is a puzzle board game consisting of a set of 72 stones and a game board of 96 squares.

Every stone has two attributes: a color and a symbol. There are six colors and six symbols in each stone set, thus creating 36 unique stones. Since each stone comes in a pair, there are therefore 72 stones in each stone set.

The primary objective of Ishido is to place all 72 stones onto the board of 96 squares. The challenge arises because stones must be placed adjacent to others that they match, either by color or symbol. When the board begins to fill up, this objective is not so easily accomplished.

A valuable move is the 4-way, in which a stone is placed in the midst of four others, two of which are matched by color, and two which are matched by symbol.

Ishido comes with 6 differently themed stone sets, 5 different game boards, and a variety of Oriental chimes and sound effects.</desc>

		<desc>The player must go around each stage and collect every sphere in order to progress. Each sphere can change the polarity of the character from red to blue and vice versa. Each stage is littered with blue and red arrows: Being the same color as these arrows will magnetize the player character, which has different effects depending on the direction the arrow is pointing: For instance, an arrow pointing down will push the player to the ground if they are the reverse color but a same-colored character can hover across as the blocks will hold them up. Conversely, an arrow pointing up will allow players of the opposite color to jump far higher from the arrow, but will almost entirely eliminate the jumping power of a same-colored character as it pulls them down.</desc>

		<name>Kaettekita Mario Bros.</name>
		<desc>Kaettekita Mario Bros. ("The Return of Mario Bros.") is an updated rerelease of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, which was one of the first games to be ported to the NES console. It adds a few new features to the format, including improved controls for Mario, cutscenes and the ability to save high scores with the Famicom Disk Reader's save function, but is otherwise identical.

The game was part of the Disk Writer system in Japan, where players could write new games over old Famicom disks at special machine vendors found in video game stores and other likely locales. This made the games cheaper to buy (as it minimized production costs) but also made games that were exclusive to this service, such as Kaettekita Mario Bros, harder to find for collectors.

Inexplicably, the game also has a sponsor: Nagatanien, a Japanese producer of seasonings for rice and noodle dishes. Mario had also previously appeared on Nagatanien Japanese TV commercials. This makes Kaettekita Mario Bros. an early example of an advergame.

The European version of Mario Bros., named Mario Bros. Classic, was based off this game rather than the NES original.</desc>

		<desc>The player assumes the role of a karate competitor and fights against another player or the computer. Using two joysticks, players can execute a number of moves.

Gameplay consists of a two dimensional fight between Karate characters wearing white and red gi, followed by various bonus rounds for the successful player. This pattern repeats itself in the next, more challenging round set against a new background. Unlike most later fighter-type games, there are no health bar or hit points. A hit successfully landed ends the round and earns the player or his opponent either one point or half point (along with a numeric score for the top ten but this has no effect on winning a match per se). The first to score two points is the winner. If the player loses a battle, the game ends. The game also featured some early speech synthesis, in which the judge would call out such phrases as "Fight!" or "Winner!" It's also spoken in Japanese in the Japanese version.</desc>

Kick Challenger: Air Foot: Vegetable Country Foot Soldier) is an action game developed by Vap for the Famicom Disk System and published in 1987. It is a single player game where the player takes control of a tomato as he marches upward through four stages in an effort to rescue his country from insects and other invaders.

You control the tomato by independently directing his two feet, one foot at a time. He make kick in eight directions with whichever foot is not planted in the ground at the given moment. Power ups are revealed by kicking trees, flowers, mushrooms, and other obstacles that are scattered throughout each stage. They may take the form of shoes which grant him the ability move on certain surfaces, or candy which gives him special abilities. Each stage has a "back side" which is accessed by stepping on holes in the ground reveal under kicked obstacles, and provide more power-ups to find.</desc>

		<name>Kieta Princess</name>
		<desc>The Kingdom of Rabia's princess goes missing during a visit to Japan, surrounding the investigation of the medicine to an "epidemic dementia," known as "Oninofuguri", and the prevention of its importing. The player takes the role of a detective determined to unravel the mystery of the missing princess Kilala, in this RPG style adventure game. Yasuko Tomita served as the model of one of the characters. Certain telephone numbers would appear, which, if called, would provide the player with a hint, spoken by Yasuko Tomita.

In order to track down Kobayashi, the criminal protagonist, you must visit five different towns and collect information. Neary every house and building can be entered, which was unique for its time. The game also features a high degree of freedom, allowing you to visit restaurants for a bite, or a Dojo to train, or to hunt for vegetation to sell for money, while you are looking for the princess.

Another introduced concept that was novel for its time was the notion of day and night changing the appearance of the city. During the evening, you may encounter a street gang, and they may open fire on you, although you can defend yourself with a revolver. However, if over 20 innocent people are gunned down, you will be arrested and sent to the police station where you must pay a fine and return to the starting point.

The degree of difficult throughout the game is considered quite high, with very few hints to help you out, while other hints are misleading. For example, one hint suggests that you if you sleep over night at a particular crossroad in a city, you will get a key item, but this hint is false. Although you are supposedly a detective, you never actually get to accuse anyone of a crime.</desc>

		<name>Kinnikuman : Kinnikusei Oui Soudatsusen</name>
		<desc>Kinnikuman - Kinnikusei Oui Soudatsusen is a wrestling game based on the popular toy line, manga and anime about a klutzy superhero who fights most of his opponents with professional wrestling moves. The first Kinnikuman game (released as M.U.S.C.L.E. in the US) was a straightforward wrestling game, but this sequel changes the action to a side-scrolling action brawler game with additional RPG and story elements. The main character can still use wrestling moves on enemies, but most of the attacks are simple punches and kicks.Curiously, the boss music is a sped up version of "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly.</desc>

		<name>Knight Lore : Majou no Ookami Otoko</name>
		<desc>Knight Lore is a a 3D isometric adventure game by Jaleco, originally released by the British game company Ultimate. Saberman, the hero of the game, has been cursed by an evil wizard. Every night, he turns into a creepy werewolf and he is on a journey to retrieve all the necessary ingredients to create a magic potion. This potion, he hopes, will get him to return to his human shape. The game starts in a dark forest, somewhere in there the wizard awaits for the potion's ingredients such as diamonds, bottles etc... Our hero's task is to wander around and find them, one at the time, and bring them back to him. But our hero must watch out, he turns into a werewolf at night and the wizard won't hesitate to use his magic against him. Saberman must make sure to always approach him as a human. Up to three items can be carried at the same time, they can also be dropped on the ground and climbed to reach higher platforms. However, once a new ingredient is delivered to the wizard, our hero leaves empty handed and lose all stored items. Series of enemies and hazards are of course scattered along his path, such as spirits, spikes or pits. Once all the ingredients are collected, the game jumps to another location where more objects need to be found with meaner hazards and enemies. This is also the point where the player's progress can be saved.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/QD2FDS/Knight Move (Japan) (Rev 1) (Disk Writer).fds</path>
		<name>Knight Move</name>
		<desc>The game is based around the concept of how a knight piece is moved in the game of chess. The player controls a knight chess piece that is constantly jumping and must continually choose which of the possible legal moves to make before the knight lands back on the board.

When the knight lands on any square on the board, it turns from white to light teal. Landing there again, turns it dark teal. Landing there yet again destroys the square altogether, leaving a hole that the player must avoid. Falling in a hole will result in a game over. Consecutively creating several holes results in a chain increasing the player's score in differing increments.

At the beginning of each "round", a heart is placed somewhere on the board. A heart (or multiple hearts) must be collected to advance to the next round, which thereby replaces all holes on the board with new white squares and places a new heart somewhere on the board. Depending on the game mode, hearts will sometimes move themselves every few jumps of the knight.

The player can also gather a small amount of extra points, at any time, by holding the A button and speeding up the knight's movement. The main objective in Knight Move is to continue this cycle, despite the increasing game speed, and reach the highest score possible.

The game also includes a simultaneous 2 player versus mode similar to the single player modes.</desc>

All teams are fictional but based out of real Canadian and American cities. The game is known for its fast paced hockey action and especially for the fighting. It is a one or two player game. When playing against the computer, there are three difficulty levels to choose from: Junior, College, and Pro (with Pro being the most difficult and Junior being the easiest). Each team consists of three forwards, two defense men, and a goaltender.</desc>

		<path>./No-Intro/QD2FDS/Konamic Tennis (Japan).fds</path>
		<name>Konamic Tennis</name>
		<desc>Konamic Tennis is part of a long line of Konami sports games made specifically for the Famicom and its Famicom Disk System peripheral, which had previously used the term "Exciting" to signify its Konami status: As is the case with games such as Exciting Baseball or Exciting Basketball (known in the west as Double Dribble). Instead, this and future Konami sports games for the system would have the "Konamic" appellation; a portmanteau of "Konami" and "dynamic". At least, this is how the same pun in its original Japanese is commonly transliterated.

Konamic Tennis follows a similar design philosophy as other tennis games at the time (and would be used for most of the ones to follow) by depicting the action from behind the serving player's side of the court. It follows the rules of the sport precisely, with a single game usually ending after four successful volleys (scored as 15, 30, 40 and Game) and the first to win six games deciding a set. Players can choose between a single set match or a longer 3-set match. They can also play in a tournament or a single one-on-one game with a CPU (or human) opponent of their choosing.

One feature Konamic Tennis introduces to the genre is that of the serving view, shown as an inset whenever a player serves the ball to start a game. The goal is to hit the ball at precisely the right moment to serve an excellent shot; too early or too late will cause the player to either hit the net or send the ball too far, or simply not hit the ball at all. In all these cases, it counts as a foul and the player has one more chance to correctly serve the ball, otherwise points are awarded to the opponent.</desc>

		<desc>Koneko Monogatari: The Adventures of Chatran is a game developed for the Family Computer Disk System in 1986 by Pony Canyon and the NES in 1987. It is actually a movie license title based on the cinema release of Koneko Monogatari, better known in the United States as The Adventures of Milo and The video game representation of this movie is quite different, and regretfully slow. It gives the player control over the kitten Milo, as he attempts to navigate through a side scrolling world of trees, hostile animals, and other obstacles. Milo plods along at a very slow pace, and can jump from tree branch to tree branch, popping fruit out from the leaves, which he must collect before they turn rotten and disappear. Every moving object from mice to beetles, is lethal to Milo and must be avoided. Fruit can be dropped on enemies for extra points. Eggs can be collected to use as weapons which must be dropped on enemies. Bottles of milk grant temporary invincibility. And if the player manages to collect four eggs that spell out the word HELP, Otis will appear to attack enemies that are headed Milo's way. However, touching Otis will also kill Milo..</desc>

The Adventure of Link is a direct sequel to the original The Legend of Zelda, and again involves the protagonist Link on a quest to save Princess Zelda -- who is not the same Princess from the first game, but another member of the royal family by the same name, who was placed under a sleeping spell a long time ago. The Adventure of Link's emphasis on side-scrolling and RPG-style elements, however, was a significant departure from its predecessor and has given it a reputation as the "black sheep" of the Zelda series. It is arguably the hardest Zelda game. Despite this reputation, the game was highly successful and introduced many elements that would become commonplace in future Zelda games.</desc>

		<desc>A long time ago, people from Ferikusu could communicate with the gods and divine spirits. The king of the kingdom is now looking for a young man to marry his daughter, the royal princess. Many contestants are selected and a tournament is organized to decide of the new prince. However, before the end or the ceremony, an evil magician sends the last hero, the one the princess has fallen in love with, to an unknown and desolated world. He also quickly realizes that he fell under a terrible curse, and he has been turned into a weird creature. The only item he has left is a magic bracelet the princess gave him. The player takes control of the lost prince and his journey will take him back to where he came from, confront the evil magician and marry the princess he loves. Each stage starts with a short animation (called a "visual stage") which unfolds the story as the game progresses. The rest of the game follows a classic top-view action formula, where the hero defeats all kind of enemies with the help of his magic powers. Sometimes, special items can be found under tree logs or rocks.</desc>

As with the Famicom Disk System adaptation of Monty on the Run, a considerable number of liberties were taken with the game's themes practically transforming it into a completely different game. Ironically, the story more closely resembles another western PC game, Captive, with its plot.
The player character witnesses a murder and is told to seek information on a shadowy organization known as the Magma Project by the dying victim. In order to effectively hunt for clues, the player character uses a device to activate a robot on the other side of the planet and employs the robot's various combat and exploration functions to track down the Magma Project.</desc>

		<name>Meikyuu Jiin Dababa</name>
		<desc>The game takes place in India, where a young man's significant-other is kidnapped by an evil wizard. He must then tackle the four areas of the labyrinth temple of Dababa to rescue her.

In order to accomplish this task, the player cannot simple move across the floor. Rather, the player and all of the enemies hop from one square tile to another, throughout the game. In a majority of stages, the player must uncover the seals which will unlock the door to the next stage by leaping on to the particular tiles which keep the seals concealed. Not every door will take the player forward, however, as some doors are trick doors that may take the player to a previous stage. In some stages, the player must simply survive the onslaught of enemies, while in others, the player is racing against the clock.</desc>

		<name>Michael English Daibouken</name>
		<desc>Michael English Daibouken (lit: "Michael's English Grand Adventure") is an educational game where the character of Michael, an orange cat, teaches kittens the various letters in the English language as well as some English vocabulary. Michael has to catch floating letters in order to spell out English words, while avoiding the incorrect letters. The game has various different backdrops, including space.

The character of Michael comes from the Japanese serial manga strip "What's Michael", created by Makoto Kobayashi which might be considered analogous to Garfield, due to them both being orange cats. It varies between observing goofy pet behavior to more abstract tales of fantasy with anthropomorphized versions of the animal characters.</desc>

		<name>Moero TwinBee : Cinnamon Hakase wo Sukue!</name>
		<desc>Moero TwinBee can be played by up to three player simultaneously: the first two players control TwinBee and WinBee (the ships from the previous game) using the standard Famicom controllers, whereas the third player controls GwinBee (a green ship) by connecting an additional controller into the console's expansion port. Unlike the original TwinBee, which only featured vertical-scrolling stages, Stinger adds side-scrolling stages to the mix as well. There are seven stages in the game. Stage 1, 3, and 7 are side-scrolling stages, while the rest are vertical-scrolling stages. The controls remain the same between the two styles of gameplay, with the only difference being that in the side-scrolling segments, the A button shoots hearts over the ship instead of dropping bombs into the ground like the vertical-scrolling segments, which helps the player keep the power-up bells afloat in the side-scrolling stages.</desc>

		<name>Monty on the Run : Monty no Doki Doki Dai Dassou</name>
		<desc>Monty no Doki Doki Dai Dassou  (Monty's heart pounding great escape), also known as Monty on the Run, is an action game developed for the Famicom Disk System by Jaleco in 1987. This game was the product of Jaleco acquiring the rights to license and publish a hit game from the European computer market titled Monty on the Run. However, unlike a similar previous effort with Knight Lore which stays close to the original source, Jaleco changed the game entirely for unknown reasons.
In Monty no Doki Doki Dai Dassou , Monty is a human being who has escaped from a penitentiary. Still dressed in striped convict clothing, Monty is on a mission to clear his name. He must proceed through four levels, each of which contains several hidden tiles. These tiles contain portions of the image of a face. At the end of each level, Monty must jump on to a platform just before the exit. This platform is a direct clue to the proper construction of the collected tiles. There are more tiles than necessary to construct a face, making some tiles extraneous. Only by paying proper attention to this final platform can the player know which face to construct. At the end of the game, the player must properly reconstruct the face of the true criminal before a judge. If the player succeeds, he will earn his freedom and win the game.</desc>

		<desc>The game starts out by depositing the pinball in the middle of a simulated pinball table. However, once the ball is shot into one of the holes on the play field, the game enters an elaborate intro sequence which the player can control. The game contains 11 stages, each of which contain a target hole that the player must hit the ball into in order to advance to the next stage. The stages get more elaborate, and more moving obstacles appear to interfere with the behavior of the ball. In addition to controlling the flippers, the control pad can also be used to "nudge" the ball in either direction, although the effectiveness of this varies.</desc>

		<name>Namida no Soukoban Special</name>
		<desc>Namida no Soukoban Special (which roughly translates into Warehouse Keeper's Tears Special) is a game that was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 by ASCII Entertainment. By 1986, many of Japan's game players were familiar with Soukoban in one form or another since its introduction in 1982. Rather than publish yet another version of the same old game, ASCII attempted to enhance the Soukoban experience for its debut on the Famicom by providing players with a unique set of tools that let players "cheat" in some fashion in comparison to the original rules. Objects like Magnets and Pulleys provided players with a limited ability to pull boxes, something which the original versions of the game prohibited. Objects such as these, or pepper, or oil, were discovered by pushing certain boxes that hid the items underneath. Progress through the game could be saved to the disk to prevent forcing players to solve puzzles that had already been solved.</desc>

		<name>Nankin no Adventure</name>
		<desc>Nankin no Adventure is a Famicom Disk System adventure game from SunSoft that plays much like every other Famicom adventure game of the era. The player selects commands from a menu in order to talk to NPCs and solve puzzles which will eventually allow them to progress. As with many of these Famicom text adventures there is a linear critical path that the player must follow in order to move to new areas and reach the next point of the story.
Nankin refers to a semi-obscure manga artist of the same name who was behind much of the art design of the game. Though the game doesn't include any of his pre-existing licenses, his distinctive art style is present throughout. This approach might be equated to Akira Toriyama's artistic involvement with the Dragon Quest and Chrono games</desc>

		<name>Nazo no Kabe : Block Kuzushi</name>
		<desc>In the year 30XX, the mankind has exhausted all the metal resources on the Earth, so they had to travel into space in order to find more. They find a planet high in minerals, and they name it Selim.

But soon they discover that there is someone watching, spying on them; it's some kind of alien race. These aliens find a hole in the humans' main computer and get inside it. The computer, programmed to self-destruct in case of a failure, starts its countdown.

There is only one way to avoid self-destruction, which is entering a 14 digit code into the machine; but these digits are hidden in the walls of the corridors in the complex. Your mission is to find these letters and avoid self-destruction, aboard the "Red Warrior", and using your only weapon, an energy ball.

Nazo no Kabe - Block Kuzushi  is an Arkanoid clone for the NES, but it's probably one of the most singular clones. You'll have to destroy all blocks but also the walls surrounding them, as the 14 letters are spread inside them, apart from killing the alien bosses here and there. In your way, you will find a bizarre mixture of enemies, from alien forms to parts of the body (eyes, lips, skulls...), who will make your game tougher by changing the direction of your ball; but also happier by dropping a sweet variety of power-ups such as the cherries (extra life), the clock (the enemies freeze), a rocket (to throw into the blocks), a fire device (the ball fires missiles), a parachute (slows the ball) an extra ball, or the weirdest of them all, the so-called Konami Man, who will take you to a secret parallel complex with different (and harder) levels.</desc>

		<desc>In feudal Japan, an evil alien descends upon Murasame castle and takes over a giant statue, which then continues to spread its influence over four neighbouring castles. The samurai apprentice Takamaru is thus summoned to recapture the castles and then take on the alien itself.

Nazo no Murasamejou is a fast-paced action game that has some similarities with The Legend of Zelda, although it is faster and has none of the RPG/Adventure elements. It is also much more linear: You fight through the castles one after the other, with each stage consisting of the path to the castle and the castle itself, where the boss is waiting.

Your have two weapons: (unlimited) shurikens for ranged attacks and a sword for melee combat. The sword is automatically used when you are close enough to an enemy, and it can also be used to deflect enemy shurikens. But since you are constantly under attack by ninjas from all directions and also have only a limited time to finish each stage, the game is still quite hard.</desc>

		<name>Nazoler Land : Soukan Gou</name>
		<desc>Nazoler Land Soukan Gou is the first in a series of minigame collections from SunSoft developed especially for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. It was followed by two direct sequels and a quiz-based spin-off.

Nazoler Land Soukan Gou (or Nazoler Land Vol. 1) has eight minigames that the player can select from a menu after loading the game up and switching the disk around. These are:
Rotation Maze

A maze-like puzzle game where a small circular being has to pass through a maze filled with dividers. The player can only pass through these dividers if there is room for it to turn around, otherwise it blocks the player's progress. The goal is to find the correct path through the maze.
Nazoler Fortune-Telling

Despite using signs of the Zodiac and suggesting a fortune-telling aspect, the game is actually a variant on the classic strategy board game Mastermind: The goal is to find the right combination of Zodiac symbols, and the game will provide hints by reporting whenever the player includes the right symbol, either in the correct place (represented by a solid star) or the wrong place (represented as a hollowed star).
Super Jigsaw

In this game the player simply has to reconstruct an image after pieces of it have been jumbled up. All the player must do is use two cursors to point to the two pieces they wish to switch around. Restoring the image to its initial state completes the challenge.
Save Princess Momoko!

Promoted as the "major feature", or the most fully-developed of the minigames. The goal is to explore a dungeon in a first-person perspective, similar to classic dungeon crawlers such as Wizardry, Dungeon Master or Shining in the Darkness, while finding items and using the correct items on the right monsters to proceed past them. Encountering these monsters before finding the right item to defeat them causes the player to lose, so there's a degree of trial and error.
Japan's Best Surroundings: Ultra Travel Quiz

A quiz based on traveling around Japan and general geographical facts. The player selects which type of transportation (train, plane, etc.) they wish to take and answers questions relating to it.
Famicom Reaction Test

In this simple "game", two players compete to hit the button on their controller as many times as they can in the short time limit. This test is presented like a Wild West duel.
Extrusion Puzzle

Similar to Super Jigsaw, only the player is sliding blocks around to make a puzzle appear. Pushing one block that's against another causes all touching blocks to move at once.
3D Maze

A simple 3D maze, presented in the same first-person perspective as the Saving Princess Momoko game, though with a stark blue and white appearance. The goal is to simply find the way out.</desc>

Unlike the other Nazoler Land disks, this one does not contain a series of different mini-games, but rather a single game focusing on a trivia quiz. The player must visit various locations around Japan in an effort to "battle" various trivia masters, and beat all eight of them in order to claim the title as the Quiz King. The game was only released in Japan, and has never been translated from Japanese. As a result, a high level of Japanese knowledge is required to play this game.</desc>

		<name>19: Neunzehn</name>
		<desc>The heir to the throne is shared by four brave people: Darius, Simon, Thales, and Sonia. The 19 gods of Olympus left behind an omnipotent stone to the great emperor Achilles, who has ordered a search to be conducted for the stone. You take the role of one of these four in an effort to find the stone on the island before the rest, waging war with opponent armies to prevent them from finding it first.
19 is somewhat unique among turn based strategy games, in that turns are taken in real time, following rules that are reminiscent of the Japanese chess-like game known as Shogi. The game takes place on an overworld map, on which players take turns moving troops. When opposing troops vi for the same location, the game switches to a zoomed-in combat screen, showing each individual member of the opposing forces. While the story of the game revolves around finding a stone, there is no actual stone to discover. Your only goal is to wipe out the armies of the other three opponents.</desc>

		<name>Omoikkiri Tanteidan HaadoGumi : Matenrou no Chousenjou</name>
		<desc>Based upon a Japanese television series that aired in 1987. It features a group of five detective kids on a mission to retrieve various objects stolen by a mysterious thief who wears a golden mask. The group counts the leader Hiroshi, the cute and Aikido expert Yasuko who also happen to be the only girl of the group, Susumu, Satoru and Takeo. The mysterious thief uses many ingenious tricks to escape his pursuers, such as a huge and colorful air-balloon.
Before getting to the main portion of the game, the player must pass the organization's test. After entering personal information such as name, birth-date and blood type, the player must go through two challenges. The first one is a memory test. Eight character faces (from a list of four) appear at random on the screen and the player needs to remember the order in which they came in. The second test is action based and the player must catch roses thrown by the thief, himself hanging from an air-balloon. Once the tests are passed, the real game starts. Our hero can move around town and visit buildings to gather information. He can also use various items such as a slingshot, a metal detector, a radio, binoculars etc. Baddies also wander around the city and must be avoided. They can also be knocked down using any weapon our hero may carry (like the slingshot) or by punching them on the chin.</desc>

		<name>Othello</name>
		<desc>Othello is a conversion of the board game. Each player tries to fill the game board with as many discs of his color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the board by selecting a location where the opponents discs will become trapped between two of his discs. The trapped discs are flipped over to the players color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out, and the player with the greatest number of his color discs on the board wins. Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.</desc>

		<name>Otocky</name>
		<desc>Otocky can be described as a musical side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The player's spaceship has a ball for a weapon, which can be fired in eight directions; each direction corresponds to a different musical note. The note plays when the player presses the fire button, and is also quantized in time so that it matches the beat playing in the background. By using the weapon selectively the player can improvise music while playing.

Otocky is notable for being one of the first games that include creative/procedural generative music.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots. When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Between some stages one of three intermission animations plays. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, he loses a life. Whenever Pac-Man occupies the same tile as an enemy, he is considered to have collided with that ghost. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. 

Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Pac-Man lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction.</desc>

		<desc>The game is based on standard pachinko rules, replicating the experience of playing pachinko in a parlor. The game board has a layout with nails sticking out. Metal balls would either of or fall in between the holes created by the pegs in order to traverse the board. Certain compartments are added to the board. Should a metal ball find its way to one of these compartments, the player will receive points that are similar to credits on a slot machine.[3] Players can expect to lose that ball (and a point) if it falls below the bottom of the board (similar to falling down a bottomless pit in an action game). Initially, the player starts off with one hundred balls.</desc>

		<name>Patlabor : The Mobile Police, Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo!</name>
		<desc>Patlabor - The Mobile Police - Dai 2 Shoutai Shutsudou Seyo is an action-platformer-shooter game from Bandai and yet another licensed game from the publishing giant. In this case, it is an adaptation of the anime and manga of the same name.

Patlabor is a portmanteau of "patrol" and "labor", with labor being the common name for technologically advanced mechanical walkers used by various construction companies to perform heavy-duty work that a human wouldn't be capable of achieving on their own. Because more and more of these labors are being hijacked by criminals, an equally powerful force of police-issued labors are commissioned and manned by members of the police force. The show follows Section 2 of the Mobile Police Patlabor division in particular.

The game is divided between side-scrolling platformer/run-and-gun levels and first-person shooter modes in which the player character, in their patlabor, must keep the peace by subduing criminals and other villains, some of which have their own labors.</desc>

Play begins when the player launches a ball with the plunger from the first screen?the bottom of the pinball table?through the top of the screen to the second screen. Play will move to the first screen if the ball falls through the bottom of the top screen and will return to the top screen if the ball is hit back through the space at the top of the first screen. The player controls the flippers on either screen to deflect the ball to keep it from falling off the bottom of the lower screen.</desc>

		<name>Pro Golfer Saru : Kage no Tournament</name>
		<desc>Pro Golfer Saru: Kage no Tournament is a golf game with fantasy elements thrown in, developed by Bandai and published on the Family Computer Disk System in 1987. The game is based on a manga (Japanese comic book) known as Pro Golfer Saru published by Fujiko Fujio (also responsible for Doraemon) about a young cave man or neanderthal-like boy who desires to become the greatest golfer in history. To accomplish this goal, he trains in the most desolate of locations, driving golf balls over giant chasms in an effort to hit greens several hundred meters away.

The game is composed of a training mode as well as the tournament challenge. The first nine holes replicate the desolate, and almost prehistoric locations that Saru normally trains in. Balls must be driven over wide spaces in order to stay in bounds and continue play. The back nine holes take place is a more modern, and even slightly futuristic locale, where Saru must sink balls from across rooftops. The game will save one players performance to disk. It was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

Failure to do so results in a loss (via count-out) or a draw (double count-out), if both wrestlers fail to re-enter in time. (Note: The referee's count is broken only after both wrestlers have re-entered the ring. That is, as long as at least one wrestler is outside the ring, the referee's count continues. Moreover, it is possible for a wrestler to be counted out while executing a "plancha" if he has crossed the ring ropes by the count of 20.</desc>

		<desc>Professional Mahjong Gokuu is the third game for the Famicom to be based on Mahjong, the competitive tile game popular in China and Japan. It is a four-person version of the game, which is generally how the game is played in real life, though uncommon in simulations during this era due to the additional computing power needed for three AI opponents.

As a "professional" Mahjong game, there is an opportunity to play a mode where the player can gamble on outcomes beforehand. The amount of cash gained or lost is usually based on the quality of the winning hand, but occasionally the player can also make bets to increase their take should they win (though, of course, any money gambled in this way is lost if someone else wins the hand).</desc>

		<name>Pulsar no Hikari : Space Wars Simulation</name>
		<desc>Pulsar no Hikari ("Pulsar of Light"): Space Wars Simulation is a game for the FDS created by computer game developer Soft Pro International. It's a rather dense strategic space simulator that has the player control a starship as it explores a galaxy and fights off enemy ships. The player needs to keep an eye on various pieces of information, such as their energy and their destination, and ensure they don't accidentally wander into an area with pulsars or black holes, or off the galaxy map all together.

Exploration in Pulsar no Hikari seems to follow a set course of scanning nearby space, moving into the next region once it's been ascertained with the long-range scanners that there are no insurmountable obstacles to be encountered there, destroy any asteroids or enemy ships that might be prowling around by checking the short-range scanners and then long-range scan/warp to the next area. Once the ship's energy/fuel is low (combat and movement will steadily drain it), the player should return to the closest star base for refuelling. Smaller star bases can refuel the ship's standard energy unit, but damage and lost ammo (the torpedoes, of which the ship has a finite amount) must be recovered at the major bases.

Accidentally warping to a location with a black hole will instantly end the game. It's generally considered a bad idea.</desc>

The goal of Radical Bomber is to carefully think out a plan of action and find a way to trap the opponents by removing connections between each "square" on the map. Successfully isolating an opponent from the rest of the board causes them to forfeit the game. If you manage to isolate every every opponent, Jirai-kun will advance the next level.

		<desc>At some point in the early history of earth, the forces of darkness known as HELL were at war with the forces of light known as HEAVEN, and the took this battle to our planet. The HELL forces quickly enslaved human beings, and the earth was cast in darkness and despair. Somewhere on the planet, a fortress was built to harness the power of the sun in order to defeat the forces of HELL, should they ever come to our planet, but it fell into ruin after centuries of neglect. The Shining Princess of HEAVEN was captured and imprisoned on the top floor of this fortress. Also inside are the spirits of the Holy Warriors of Light who have the power to defeat the forces of HELL. However, they are asleep and unable to awaken. Earth's only hope is you, a being who has sacrificed his body in order to inhabit the fallen bodies of the departed. To succeed, you must use each body to obtain the key words which are found in, and used to open, the dungeons of the fortress.</desc>

		<name>Replicart</name>
		<desc>The game takes place at the end of the 21st century. A gigantic snake-like alien called Sonada invades Earth and constructs a base under the soil. Sonada attacks various locations, stealing precious resources, and appears invulnerable to all forms of modern offenses. Engineers regroup and construct a base where a new weapon can be developed. They create the Replicart in the image of Sonada, and give it the power to convert resources into new material that can extend the Replicart and increase its strength until it reaches enough power to destroy the invader.

Replicart is to the original Snake game what Arkanoid is to Breakout; an upgrade that takes the core features of the game and expands upon them by adding enemies, power-ups and more elaborate play settings. In it you must move a robotic snake through mazes in an effort to collect a required number of pieces before the exit will open. The snake's length extends by one unit for every piece collected. If the snake's head touches any of the walls, enemies or its own body, it is destroyed and the player loses one life.

The conversion to the Famicom Disk System by Taito is quite different than the MSX2 original. The number of levels has been reduced to 100, but between every 10 levels, a boss battle occurs in which the player must chase a monster around the screen and blast it until the monster takes enough damage. A bonus level is provided for the player after each boss is defeated before they progress to the next level.</desc>

In the game, you control a protagonist that you name, but the game also stars Risa Tachibana, a popular Japanese singer around the time of the game's release. Together with Risa, your goal is to defeat a witch of darkness by obtaining several key items. Six of Risa's songs are interwoven into the adventure, and the lyrics can provide clues to the proper solution of the game, which is divided into four chapters. At times, a telephone number would appear on the screen, and a telephone service was established for a limited time so that players could call the numbers to get more clues. At times, use of the microphone on the second Famicom controller is required to make progress in the game.</desc>

		<name>Roger Rabbit</name>
		<desc>Help Roger Rabbit collect hearts in various levels and save Jessica Rabbit while avoiding the dastardly weasels! This was eventually released in the US as Bugs Bunny's Crazy Castle and changed the hearts to carrots and the weasels into various characters from Looney Tunes. This was due to Kemco losing the rights to Roger Rabbit in the US.

While presented in a side-scroller format, Roger Rabbit differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Roger Rabbit did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Roger avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects.</desc>

		<desc>Samurai Sword is an adventure game developed and published by Capcom for the Famicom Disk System in Japan towards the end of 1988. The player is an unnamed hero who is promptly defeated by the game's antangonist Soron and whisked away before the moment of his demise in order to find a way to counter Soron's considerable magical might.

While the game may resemble an RPG at first, it is actually a traditional Famicom adventure game, similar to Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom. The player can select from a set of commands for the hero to follow such as looking around, talking to NPCs, picking up items and so on. While there are battles, they can only be resolved by finding the right command (often the right spell) rather than the standard RPG method of exchanging blows governed by various statistics.</desc>

The second version was sold for a much cheaper ¥500 in the beginning of 1988 as part of the "Disk Writer" system, where players could bring their own blank disks to a kiosk and have a game of their choice written to the disk. While both versions contain 10 maps to play on, the Disk Writer edition replaces five of the maps from the original edition with new designs. "Gachapon Senshi" means toy capsule warrior, as the gachapon toy capsule was a popular format for fans of the series to buy super-deformed versions of their favorite Gundam characters.</desc>

		<desc>An expansion of sorts for SD Gundam World Gachapon Senshi - Scramble Wars which plays just like the original but includes 5 new maps to play on.

While the game is considered memorable, especially for being the first in a long line of SD Gundam World games to come, the single-player experience is known for having considerable flaws and a high level of difficulty. While one could forgive the long load times common among the Famicom Disk System games, it was much harder to overlook the exaggeratedly long periods of time that the computer AI took to plan out its moves. This could range from thirty seconds to a several minutes just for one of the three possible commands. Additionally, entering into combat against the computer was a difficult challenge, as the computer opponent played with lightning fast reactions that human players could not compete with without an exceptional amount of practice. It was, however, possible to trick the computer into trapping itself against obstacles on the right maps.</desc>

		<desc>An enemy space fortress of the Balangool Empire is approaching Earth. Captain Commando has to infiltrate it and find his way to Section-Z to destroy L-Brain, the computer controlling the fortress.
Secton-Z is a side-scrolling game in which the player is a space soldier who can land on the ground and other platform structures and run along them. It is one of the first games which gives players the ability to not only shoot forward, but backwards. It is also one of the first games to give players a choice of paths at the end of each level. Depending on which path they took, they could get special weapons or bombs which wouldn't show up if the other path was taken. To compensate for this, the path without the weapon is often easier. They can activate these special weapons by pressing Select.
Sometimes, one of the paths will be flashing red instead of the usual yellow. This indicates that it is impassable unless the player locates and destroys the Generator Boss that is creating the field. Therefore, it is imperative to find the right paths through the fortress to get to the Generator and blow it up. Once this is done, it is possible to safely pass through the red gates and move onto the rest of the area, and eventually, the area boss. Each time a generator is destroyed the player will earn a capsule that increases total HP.</desc>

People lived in fear, there only hope a legend?nn'A hero holding a sword will appear and restore peace to our land once again.'nnNo one knew when this hero would arrive?nnSaid the devil beast: "What's that? You challenge me? I see. Very well then. I accept your challenge. However, you will never win!"nnSeiken Psycho Calibur: Maju no Mori Densetsu is an adventure game for the Famicom Disk System, developed by Imagineer and published in 1987. It is part of the Wave Jack series of games produced by Imagineer that come with more accessories than the average video game, including a story book and audio cassette tape.
Seiken Psycho Calibur is, in many ways, an attempt to copy the success of The Legend of Zelda. However, it fails to inspire the same level of wonder and fascination. It also lacks a good degree of polish that made the afore mentioned title so great. Nevertheless, Seiken Psycho Calibur is a relatively fun game to play, as long as you have a fair degree of insight into how the game is played. There are some unintuitive aspects of the game that can make progress in the game quite difficult.
For example, you begin the game in a town which offers a variety of goods for sale, but you only receive so much money, and you can never return to the town once you leave. Therefore, what you decide to invest your money in has a substantial impact on the difficulty of the game early on. Many items can be bought for less money later on, but only if you know the location of the hidden shops that contain them. Other less obvious points in the game require a bit of back tracking from later areas to earlier areas in order to acquire items that allow you to proceed, and boss battles that are at times incredibly difficult.</desc>

Despite everything Sylviana tried, her mother's condition only got worse. Then one day, she heard a rumor about a Dr. Doppler, who can create a medicine that will cure any disease. She decides to head out and find this Dr. Doppler, and convince him to give her the medicine. However, she soon finds out that the doctor is unable to help her, due to having had his eight treasures stolen from him by demons. Sylviana vows to return the treasures to him in exchange for the medicine.
The game borrows it's combat system from games like Hydlide and Ys: Ancient Ys Vanished, where damage is inflicted upon (and exchanged with) enemies by crashing into them. However, there are no levels or experience points, so Sylviana's power only grows by virtue of the improved equipment that she purchases or finds. Throughout the game, the player wanders around a world map in order to find towns where goods may be purchased, and caves or towers which must be explored to find treasure. Eventually, the player enters a cave and steps through a mirror to enter the mirror image of the original world map, with increased difficulty.</desc>

		<name>Smash Ping Pong</name>
		<desc>Smash Ping Pong simulates the game of ping-pong or table tennis in a remarkably different manner than prior simulations of any variety of tennis. Rather than putting the emphasis on precise control and placement of the paddle in order to return the ball, the emphasis is on timing and strategic control of the ball's speed and trajectory. The player sees no other on-screen representation of themselves beyond a hand holding a paddle. The hand and the paddle automatically move left and right to match the horizontal position of the ball. Players need only concern themselves with the timing of their paddle swing, and the style of swing to use. Players can choose between three different swings, along with the choice of forehand or backhand. 

The Famicom Disk System conversion was developed by Konami, and published directly by Nintendo as Smash Ping Pong. As a result,Konami's penguin mascot Pentarou was replaced by Diskun, the Famicom Disk System mascot, on the title screen, and Donkey Kong Jr. appears in the stands on the right side.

		<desc>The main character, named Dana, is sent to retrieve "Solomon's Key" to restore the world to light from demons that were accidentally released. The object of the game is to advance through the 50 rooms of "Constellation Space" by acquiring a key to the door that leads to the next room before a timer runs out. The game incorporates elements of the platform shooter genre. Dana can run, jump, create or destroy orange blocks adjacent to him as well as create fireballs to destroy demons. The orange blocks can also be destroyed by hitting them with the character's head twice. Along the way Dana can acquire items to upgrade his firepower and extra lives as well as items that award bonus points and unlock hidden rooms. With certain items, Dana must make, then break blocks (sometimes in a certain manner) to make these appear.</desc>

Super Boy Allan is the second game in Sunsoft's "Intelligence Game" edutainment series for the Famicom Disk System, featuring two different game modes.

The first game mode, which is also the main game, the player has to avoid contact with enemies and push logs in order to solve math-based problems to get extra items. Solving math problems also increases your ability to move several logs at once, which is needed to make further progress.

The second, and much simpler game mode, has the player to finish a 39-steps marathon run by correctly answering simple math questions to accumulate as many points as possible.</desc>

		<name>Super Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>Douglas E. Smith's Lode Runner was introduced to Japan in 1983 on various popular Japanese home computer platforms, including the MSX, Sharp X1, and NEC PC family computers. Hudson Soft licensed the rights to bring the game to Nintendo's Famicom, and it was released in 1984 as one of the first 3rd party games ever made for the system and it was an incredible hit. Around the same time, Irem licensed the rights to produce an arcade version of Lode Runner which they also released in 1984, along with three other sequels through 1986. These arcade versions made a few tweaks to the original game play, and the final arcade game introduced a two player cooperative mode.

In 1987, Irem decided to package a number of select stages from all four of the arcade games into one title, and released it in disk format for the Famicom Disk System, entitled Super Lode Runner. Though the graphics were not quite as good as the arcade games, they were close, and Irem brought many of the game play changes to Famicom players, including the new two player mode. Irem released a sequel later on that same year. A different version of the game was released for the MSX with the same title.</desc>

		<desc>Originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros.® 2, this game has previously made only brief cameo appearances in the Western hemisphere. Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if that?s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game?s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just don?t be surprised if she?s in another castle!</desc>

		<desc>The game is based on a manga and anime for children of the same name that concerns the cats and dogs of a close-knit neighborhood. 



The game has a subtitle: 3 Choume Daibouken. The "3 Choume" part refers to the district in which Tama and his friends live, while "Daibouken" simply means "great adventure".



As a game, Tama and Friends is very basic, and quite clearly meant for very young children. The goal is to simply walk right across a suburban environment while avoiding enemies like birds and random flying junk. Tama can also climb telegraph poles to help him get higher, which occasionally lead to bonus areas, and there are also bosses to be fought at the end of certain stages.</desc>

		<desc>Tantei Jinguuji Saburou - Kiken na Futari - Zenpen  (Detective Saburou Jinguuji: Danger For Two, Part 1) is a mystery-adventure game developed by Data East for the Famicom Disk System in 1988. It is the third game of the long standing Tantei Jinguuji Saburou series, following Tantei Jinguuji Saburou: Yokohama-kou Renzoku Satsujin Jiken. In the third mystery, the detective visits a race circuit at the invitation of one of Yulia's friends. A motorcycle racer, Sabin Olsen, crashes at the circuit, but a different racer's body is recovered from the crash site. At the same time, Sabin Olsen, at a hotel, is found where a man he was supposed to meet was killed causing Olsen to be framed as he fled the hotel. Due to memory constraints on the size of the disks, this game was broken up into two parts. This is the first part, while the second part, Tantei Jinguuji Saburo: Kiken na Futari Kouhen, was release a few months later.</desc>

During play, the game predicts the player's future in several areas, including love, finance, and education. It followed a series of other astrological "utility" programs for the platform, including Chuugoku Senseijutsu and '89 Dennou Kyuusei Uranai.

The game focuses on the Tarot deck and their supposed clairvoyant properties. The game will randomly shuffle a deck and lay them out in a formation of the player's choosing - each formation is meant to predict a different aspect of the player's life. The game will then reveal cards that the player chooses and decipher the meaning behind them.</desc>

		<name>Time Twist : Rekishi No Katasumi De... - Zenpen</name>
		<desc>Time Twist: Rekishi no Katasumi de... is an adventure game for the Famicom Disk System in which the protagonist is a disembodied ghost trying to track down his body, which has been taken over by a time-travelling demon. The demon is wrecking havoc across various points in history and the player, as the boy's spirit, has to try and stop it. The player has at their disposal the unique ability to possess various animals and people as well as the usual set of menu-driven commands common to Famicom adventure games.

Time Twist was created by Pax Softnica and Nintendo themselves, using much of the same staff that worked on the two Famicom Mukashi Bunashi (Famicom Fairy Tale) games: Shin Onigashima (New Oni Island) and Yuyuuki (Brave Spirits).

Time Twist would also be the very last game developed by Nintendo for the Famicom Disk System peripheral and was also the last packaged game to be sold for the device. Later games for the peripheral would be sold entirely through the Disk Writer service. Time Twist itself would eventually be sold via the Disk Writer service as well, as packaged versions were in short supply and have since become something of a collector's item as a result.</desc>

		<desc>Titanic Mystery (lit. Titanic Mystery: Shiver of Blue) is an underwater exploration game developed by Activision and published by Gakken in 1987 for the Family Computer Disk System. It has a female protagonist that the player controls while searching sunken ships.

The game is slightly famous for its instruction booklet which contains a short manga-style story. Despite the fact that most Famicom users at this time were children, this manga story features the protagonist in a shower scene. The game was never released outside of Japan, nor was it ever translated from Japanese.</desc>

		<name>Tobidase Daisakusen</name>
		<desc>Tobidase Daisakusen was developed by Square in 1987 and was published by DOG, a now-defunct label of Square. The North American release, which was the first Square game to reach American shores, was published by Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. for the NES under the name The 3-D Worldrunner.

The gameplay can best be described as an attempt to merge Super Mario Bros. game mechanics with Space Harrier's third person perspective. In the game, the player assumes the role of Jack, a wild "space cowboy" on a mission to save various planets overrun by serpent-like beasts. The game takes place in Solar System #517, which is being overrun by a race of aliens known as Serpentbeasts, who are led by the evil Grax. As WorldRunner, the player must battle through eight planets to destroy Grax. For its time, the game was technically advanced; the game's three dimensional scrolling effect is very similar to the linescroll effects used by Pole Position and many racing games of the day.

Part of the appeal and selling point of 3-D WorldRunner was its "3-D mode," and it was the first of three games by Square to feature such an option (the other two being JJ, the sequel to 3-D WorldRunner, and Rad Racer). When the 3-D mode is selected, the game uses computer image processing techniques to combine images from two slightly different viewpoints into a single image, known as anaglyph images. The game was packaged with cardboard "anaglyph glasses," which use red and cyan color filters to moderate the light reaching each eye to create the illusion of a three dimensional image.

Tobidase Daisakusen was designed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, Nobuo Uematsu, and Nasir Gebelli, all whom would later rise to fame as core members of the team behind the popular RPG Final Fantasy. The three also developed JJ - Tobidase Daisakusen Part II, the sequel to 3-D WorldRunner.</desc>

		<desc>Tooyama no Kinsan Space Chou - Mr. Gold is a graphical text adventure game developed by Toei Animation for the Famicom Disk System, and published in Japan in 1988. The game is based on an anime OVA "Tooyama Sakura Uchuu Chou - Yatsu no Na wa Gold" (or simply Samurai Gold) which in turn is loosely based on real-life samurai Tooyama Kagemoto. Mr. Gold is a sci-fi adventure about a hero with a cherry blossom tattoo who fights crimes across the cosmos. This character archetype is usually contributed to fictional adaptations of the Tooyama Kagemoto legend, though rarely with a Ziggy Stardust sci-fi theme.The game plays much like any other NES text adventure: The player is presented with a window of what the main character can see and is given options in various menus for what the player can do at any given moment, such as pick up nearby objects or talk to nearby people. Much of the game is spent following co-ordinates to different locations and discovering where to go next.</desc>

There are eight distinct scenes, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other scenes. How the scenes connect is random on each play through. The goal is to locate the key which is necessary to access to warp which leads to the eight and final scene, collect it from whichever scene it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth scene before any other competitor.</desc>

		<desc>Transformers: The Headmasters is a 1987 Family Computer Disk System game by Takara based on the popular cartoon series of the same name and released only in Japan. The game stars the Autobot Headmasters as the protagonists and playable characters. The game is infamous for its high level of difficulty and off-key background music.

You play as one of the Autobot Headmaster through four planets, fighting the Decepticons. Unlike it predecessor, Transformers: Convoy no Nazo, players cannot switch between robot and vehicle mode. Instead, each level contains an initial vehicle mode stage, followed by a robot mode stage. Players start out with only Chromedome. They can switch between Autobots at any time, but only if that Autobot has been collected. Players must rescue them throughout the game, as they will be flown in by helicopter in the vehicle mode stage, or found in one of the rooms of the robot mode stage. Since Headmasters was developed for the FDS, it contains a save game feature similar to those found in early The Legend of Zelda and Metroid games.</desc>

		<name>TwinBee</name>
		<desc>TwinBee can be played by up to 2-players simultaneously. The player takes control of a cartoon-like anthropomorphic spacecraft, with Player 1 taking control of TwinBee, the titular ship, while Player 2 controls WinBee. The game controls consists of a joystick and two buttons: one for shooting enemies in the air and the other for dropping bombs to ground enemies (similarly to Xevious).

The player's primary power-ups are bells that can be uncovered by shooting at the floating clouds where they're hidden. If the player continues shooting the bell after it appears, it will change into one of four other colors: the regular yellow bells only grant bonus points, the white bell will upgrade the player's gun into a twin cannon, the blue bell increases the player's speed (for up to five speed levels), the green bell will allow the player to create image copies of its ship for additional firepower, and the red bell will provide the player's ship a barrier that allows it to sustain more damage. The green and red bells cannot be combined together. Other power-ups can also be retrieved from ground enemies such as an alternate bell that gives the player's ship a three-way gun, a star which eliminates all on-screen enemies.

As with other games of the same genre, getting shot by a single enemy bullet will cause the player to lose a life. However, if the bullet only strikes either side of the ship instead, the player's ship will only lose one of its arms. If the player's ship loses both arms, it will lose the ability to throw bombs and the player must wait for an ambulance to arrive. The player must navigate their ship to the ambulance to repair their arms. However, if the player's ship loses both arms for the second time, no ambulance will arrive.

If two players are playing at the same time, they can align their ships vertically or horizontally together to perform more powerful attacks</desc>

		<name>Ultraman : Kaijuu Teikoku no Gyakushuu</name>
		<desc>Ultraman: Kaiju Teikoku no Gyakushu, loosely translated as "Ultraman: Counterattack of the Monster Empire" is a side scrolling platformer developed for the Family Computer Disk System and published by Bandai at the start of 1987. This game is the first Famicom game dealing with Ultraman. Ultraman 2 was a sequel developed as a simulation game, and Ultraman Club: Chikyuu Dakkan Sakusen was developed as an RPG utilizing the "chibi" or super-deformed style of artwork for the characters.

The player controls Hayate, a member of the Science Special Search Party, which protects the earth from invasions of large hostile aliens. He must run across each stage, defeating enemies with his ray gun. He must also collect energy orbs to fill a meter on the screen. When it is full, he can transform himself into the powerful Ultraman. Energy balls can appear under a variety of circumstance, such as beating an enemy or shooting points in space. Just like in the show, you can only be Ultraman for 3 minutes, and you can chop or kick the boss monsters. When only one minute remains, Ultraman will gain access to two secret powers, the Specium Ray, and the Cutting Halo. Once the boss monster is defeated, the stage is cleared.

If all 11 stages are cleared and the player continues, the game will change the character to Dan Moroboshi who can transform into Ultra Seven. Although Ultra Seven's capabilities are the same as Ultraman's, the defensive power of the enemies will be higher. There are two versions of this game, one which was distributed on disk, and one which was distributed through disk writing stations (made available on March 26, 1987) and they feature slightly different background music tunes.</desc>

(Loosely translated as Ultraman 2: Sortie Department Group) is an action game developed by Bandai for the Famicom Disk System and published at the end of 1987. As the title implies, it revolves around the Ultraman series that was popular in Japan. However, rather than making Ultraman the focus of this game, it is the defense support team that goes into action whenever Japan is attacked by a giant monster which gets the majority of the game time.

The game takes place in modern Japan, with a bird's eye view presentation of much of Japan's metropolis. Players must send a team out to search for, and obtain, a cube which permits the defense team to damage monsters when they appear. Once the cube is found, monsters begin to appear and attack the buildings of Japan. The team must deploy vehicles to help aid in the destruction of these monsters until they have all been defeated. If a monster destroys a critical building, the game is instantly over.</desc>

In the game the player will control their players by using the d-pad, and will use the b button to perform the game's various actions. The a button is not used in Volleyball. On the court there are two rows, 1 and 2. When the ball nears one of the rows, the team members in that row will then be able to be controlled by the player. If you are unable to hit the ball over the net, then the opposing team receives one point. After hitting the ball to the other side, the other team may or may not hit it over. If they don't your team receives one point.

To serve, the player must press the b button, wait for the ball to come back down to them and then press the b button again. When the opposing team serves, you will have to quickly hit it back over. Occasionally when you simply hit the ball, it'll go straight up in the air. If this happens, you'll have to press the b button once more in order to hit it over.</desc>

		<name>Wakusei Aton Gaiden</name>
		<desc>Wakusei Aton Gaiden ("Planet Aton Side-Story") is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up that was created by the Japanese National Tax Agency (Kokuzeichou) in order to teach children and older players about the issues surrounding Japan's bubble economy by way of a sci-fi themed parable. The story concerns the eponymous planet Aton and two young pilots who attempt to save it from some sort of economy-based crisis - one that just so happens to manifests itself as an alien invasion. The game can be played by one or two players, with player one assuming the role of the male pilot Kanta while the second player assumes the role of the female pilot Yuki.

The game was made accessible to players via a system not unlike the Disk Writer service, though presumably as a government-funded game it was made freely available. It is thought that copies were given away at some manner of a Japanese tax awareness convention or from an educational group that went to various schools across the country to lecture students. As with many Disk Writer exclusive games, it is extremely difficult for modern day Famicom collectors to find.</desc>

		<name>Wrecking Crew</name>
		<desc>The player controls Mario (or Luigi in two-player mode) and attempts to destroy all of a certain set of objects with a large hammer on each of 100 levels. Mario cannot jump because of the hammer's weight. The player can select any level to start on from the title screen. Each level takes place on a playfield divided into an invisible grid, each space of which can contain one object. Objects include destructible walls, pillars, and ladders, indestructible barrels and ladders, bombs that destroy all connected destructible objects, and various enemies that Mario must avoid. Doors may also exist, which can be opened to cause enemies to move harmlessly into the background. The game also introduced a new character, a construction foreman named Spike (believed to be an early version of Wario), who chases Mario and attempts to disrupt him by knocking down objects and causing him to fall to the bottom of the playfield. The player starts the game with five lives and loses a life whenever Mario comes in contact with an enemy or fireball. The game is over when all lives are lost. The game can also be aborted at any time, and must be aborted if Mario becomes trapped in a barrel.</desc>

During this golden age, the Gamps were human clones used in heavy labor, until they rebelled to their own creators.

		<path>./No-Intro/QD2FDS/Yume Koujou - Doki Doki Panic (Japan) (DV 2).fds</path>
		<name>Yume Koujou Doki Doki Panic</name>
		<desc>Yume Koujou Doki Doki Panic  (translated as "Dream Factory: Heart-Pounding Panic") is a Japan-only video game developed by Nintendo in cooperation with Fuji Television for the Family Computer Disk System to promote its event called Yume Koujou '87 (translates to Dream Factory '87).

It was later released outside of Japan in an altered format under the name Super Mario Bros. 2, since the original Japanese Super Mario Bros. sequel, Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, was deemed too similar to the original and too difficult for overseas players. Eventually, the altered Mario version of Doki Doki Panic was released in Japan as well, under the title Super Mario USA. 

The story starts with two chidren, the young twins Piki and Poki, peacefully reading a story book. However, they accidentally tear off the last page of the book - little did they know that the book is actually magic! The evil Mamu suddenly appears, and his huge three-fingered hand pulls them into a quirky dream world. 

The goal of Doki Doki Panic is to help the whole family (namely Imajin, Lina and their parents Mama and Papa) rescue their poor children kidnaped by the evil king lizard. Each member has its own strengths and weaknesses - Imaji is a balanced character whereas Lina is fairly light weight and can effortlessly hover and fly over short distances, but she is really slow at picking up items. Papa is the strongest of the group and can throw enemies and items really far, whereas Mama can jump higher than anyone. As aforementioned, each character can carry enemies, items, and especially radishes and other vegetables that can be pulled out of the ground and used as lethal weapons. The game features a myriad of other items, such as bombs (self explanatory), Power blocks (similar to Mario Bros's POW blocks that kill all enemies on screen), Stars (temporary invincibility), keys (to unlock doors), Hearts (extra health) or the mysterious magic lamps that open doors to the Dark World - mirror areas where our heroes can find special items or heart containers. 

Doki Doki Panic follows a story book structure, and is made out of seven chapters (areas) and twenty pages (levels). Interestingly, although the player can play the Doki Doki Panic with any character, it has to eventually defeat the evil Mamu with all four to finally beat the game (the player can separately save each character's progress).</desc>

		<name>Yuu Maze</name>
		<desc>Yuu Maze ("Maze Play") is a single-screen maze game akin to Namco's classic Pac-Man and its many other imitators in that the goal of the game is to drive the futuristic vehicle around a maze collecting dots while avoiding (or temporarily eliminating) the enemies. Taito, one of the largest manufacturers of Arcade games at the time (not to mention the creators of Space Invaders), would produce similarly Arcade-reminiscent games for the system in order to tap into the portion of the market nostalgic for classic Arcade experiences.Yuu Maze adds a few innovations to the format: Each maze has a different structure, different enemies and different lay-outs for the pellets that are required to complete the level; the player can find power-ups which grant weapons, shields and speed-ups to their vehicle. The player's vehicle also has some degree of inertia: There's a slight delay when attempting to accelerate after stopping or performing a U-turn, but if the player keeps moving and changes direction only at 90 degree intervals, they can keep moving at their maximum speed. This is often necessary to keep ahead of the fast moving enemies.</desc>

Like it's prequel the game takes place in a 3D dungeon crawling environment only this time there is a tower to conquer as well as a dungeon. Battles also happen in real-time so if you idle too long you will quickly be attacked. However once you reach certain levels enemies will no longer randomly attack you.</desc>

		<name>Zelda no Densetsu : The Hyrule Fantasy</name>
		<desc>A small kingdom in the land of Hyrule, the setting of the game, is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded it and stole the Triforce of Power, a part of a magical artifact bestowing great strength. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, another of the pieces, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is eventually kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, though a young boy named Link appears and rescues her.  After hearing Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon.

The Legend of Zelda incorporates elements of action, adventure, and role-playing games. The player controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels in the overworld, a large outdoor map with varied environments. Link begins the game armed only with a small shield, but a sword becomes available to Link after he ventures into a cave that is accessible from the game's first map screen. Throughout the game, various characters aid Link by giving or selling equipment and clues. These people can be found in caves scattered throughout the overworld; some are readily accessible, while others are hidden behind obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls

Nintendo originally released the game as the launch title for the Family Computer's new Disk System peripheral. The Legend of Zelda was joined by a re-release of Super Mario Bros., Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Soccer, and Mahjong in its introduction of the Disk System. It made full use of the Disk Card media's advantages over traditional ROM cartridges with a disk size of 128 kilobytes, which was expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of space on the disk, however, it was only in katakana. Rather than passwords, it used rewritable disks to save the game. It used the extra sound channel provided by the Disk System for certain sound effects; most notable are the sounds of Link's sword when his health is full, the roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and enemy death sounds. The sound effects used the Famicom's PCM channel in the cartridge version. It also used the microphone built into the Famicom's controller that was not included in the NES. This led to confusion in the U.S. as the instruction manual reads that Pols Voice, a rabbit-like enemy in the game, "hates loud noise". Blowing or shouting into the Famicom's microphone kills these creatures. However, they cannot be killed through use of the recorder, and on the NES must be killed with weapons.</desc>
