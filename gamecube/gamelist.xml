		<desc>You're a little yellow alien. The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth. And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep. After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?

Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them. The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin. Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible. Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.

To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection.</desc>

		<desc>An original roleplaying game for Nintendo GameCube from the team behind Xenosaga. The game makes heavy use of cards for everything from fighting battles to purchasing items. Cards are actually a central part of the story as well, as they are holders for "Magnus" which is short for "Magna Essence." Magnus is the true nature of all things throughout the world, including swords, magic spells and even apples that are gathered in the town in which your adventures start out. A real item can be turned into Magnus form and stored in a blank card. It can then be taken out from the card and will turn back into real form. Features detailed CG cutscenes to tell the story and turn-based battle sequences.</desc>

		<name>Baten Kaitos Origins</name>
		<desc>Baten Kaitos Origins is a prequel to Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean. Long ago, the evil god Malpercio attempted to destroy the other gods; a large battle of the gods ensued, and following this the people of the world were forced to flee to various islands floating in the sky. 1000 years after the war the people live peacefully in the sky for the most part; but Emperor Olgen, the emperor of one of these islands, has begun a plot to gain control of all the islands.

The main character of the story is Sagi, a "Spirit-born" individual who has been given a secret mission to assassinate Emperor Olgen. In similar fashion to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, you don't actually control Sagi in the game but rather his guardian spirit. Throughout the game you can give Sagi advice, and as you progress the story will unfold revealing the plot that may threaten all of the islands...

Gameplay is similar to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and features a card based battle system. Many items in the world have a "magna essence"; these items can be captured in a card for use later. Some items are useful for attacking and defending, others can help replenish your health, and some can be used to solve puzzles. When a battle begins your deck of cards will be randomly dealt to you; battles are turn based, on each turn you can select cards from those visible to use. Different cards also feature different attributes, and various combos are possible. When a battle is won, your characters will earn experience points, gold, and will also recover all hit points.

The battles in the game aren't random; as you explore the worlds, enemies will be visible on screen in some areas and contact with them begins the battle. In addition to the main story line, numerous sub-quests will also become available by talking with various characters; completing a sub-quest will typically earn a useful item for you as well as provide an opportunity for your characters to level up. You will encounter many types of enemies on both the main quest and subquests; since different enemies may require different strategies, you have the ability to customize the deck of cards you will use in battle. As you gain experience, you will also gain the ability to create multiple decks.</desc>

In similar fashion to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, you don't actually control Sagi in the game but rather his guardian spirit. Throughout the game you can give Sagi advice, and as you progress the story will unfold revealing the plot that may threaten all of the islands...

Gameplay is similar to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and features a card based battle system. Many items in the world have a "magna essence"; these items can be captured in a card for use later. Some items are useful for attacking and defending, others can help replenish your health, and some can be used to solve puzzles. When a battle begins your deck of cards will be randomly dealt to you; battles are turn based, on each turn you can select cards from those visible to use. Different cards also feature different attributes, and various combos are possible. When a battle is won, your characters will earn experience points, gold, and will also recover all hit points.

The battles in the game aren't random; as you explore the worlds, enemies will be visible on screen in some areas and contact with them begins the battle. In addition to the main story line, numerous sub-quests will also become available by talking with various characters; completing a sub-quest will typically earn a useful item for you as well as provide an opportunity for your characters to level up. You will encounter many types of enemies on both the main quest and subquests; since different enemies may require different strategies, you have the ability to customize the deck of cards you will use in battle. As you gain experience, you will also gain the ability to create multiple decks.</desc>

In similar fashion to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, you don't actually control Sagi in the game but rather his guardian spirit. Throughout the game you can give Sagi advice, and as you progress the story will unfold revealing the plot that may threaten all of the islands...

Gameplay is similar to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and features a card based battle system. Many items in the world have a "magna essence"; these items can be captured in a card for use later. Some items are useful for attacking and defending, others can help replenish your health, and some can be used to solve puzzles. When a battle begins your deck of cards will be randomly dealt to you; battles are turn based, on each turn you can select cards from those visible to use. Different cards also feature different attributes, and various combos are possible. When a battle is won, your characters will earn experience points, gold, and will also recover all hit points.

The battles in the game aren't random; as you explore the worlds, enemies will be visible on screen in some areas and contact with them begins the battle. In addition to the main story line, numerous sub-quests will also become available by talking with various characters; completing a sub-quest will typically earn a useful item for you as well as provide an opportunity for your characters to level up. You will encounter many types of enemies on both the main quest and subquests; since different enemies may require different strategies, you have the ability to customize the deck of cards you will use in battle. As you gain experience, you will also gain the ability to create multiple decks.</desc>

		<name>Batman Begins</name>
		<desc>In this adaptation of the film of the same name, the origins of the Batman legend are explored. Playing as both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, Batman, you will need to hunt evil forces in familiar locations such as Arkham asylum, Gotham City, but also in the Himalaya. Using both stealth and brutal skills, you take on enemies in true beat-em-up style. Batman has a vast array of moves, from kicks and punches to more exotic special moves. Multiple enemies can be attacked at once, and there are tricks to break through enemies' defenses. Also, certain attacks can only be used as a finishing move when opponents are weakened.

Next to the melee combat, Batman carries his Bat Utility Belt with a Batgrapple to reach higher areas, the Batarang and gadgets such as smoke and flash grenades, a lockpick, camera hacker and an optical wire to peek from behind corners.

Certain levels turn Batman Begins into a racing game, as you drive the shiny Batmobile at high speeds though Gotham City. During these missions, your progress is measured by a reputation meter, which increases when you take out cops and thugs, and decreases when you harm civilians. There is nitro available for even higher speeds and an armour meter shows the status of your car.</desc>

		<name>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</name>
		<desc>In the future, on the planet Hillys, the population suffers from constant attacks from the alien DomZ. The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.

You control the young reporter/photographer Jade, with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.

Beyond Good &amp; Evil is an action-adventure game with diverse game play. Most of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). As the game progresses, a large story unfolds, even dealing with some social issues on the way.</desc>

Players make cash by trading various commodities in the five cities that make up Hick State County, by taking on special jobs (some legal, some not so legal), by wagering with other rival drivers and by causing as much chaos as possible!</desc>

The dark spirit Makuta has infected the Rahi throughout the island -- using his control of the Bohrok, Bohrok-Kal, and Rahkshi to kidnap the Matoran villagers throughout the various Wahi. It's up to the guardians of each Wahi, the Toa warriors Tahi, Lewa, Kopaka, Gali, Pohatu, and Onua, to rescue the Matorans and find the Toa of Light, who is the only one strong enough to stop Makuta. Players control the six Toa heroes in this blend of platform action, combat and racing. Use elemental powers to defeat enemies, then snowboard down mountains, surf through lava fields, ride mine carts and grind along tree limbs.</desc>

		<name>Bloodrayne</name>
		<desc>There are things in the world that humanity should not know about, and things it must be protected from. It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.

Rayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and sub machine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appear to slow down.</desc>

The setting for the game is a space station that has been overrun by hostile aliens. You play as a bad-ass soldier dude who will single-handedly wipe the aliens out.

You travel around each level in a non-linear fashion.  You have to fight your way through endless hordes to find keys, flip switches, use elevators, and then ultimately defeat a big boss at the end.</desc>

		<desc>Slightly unusual for a tricks/stunt game, BMX XXX adds a twist to its genre by employing themes involving foul language, nudity and toilet humour.

The "Hardcore Tour" mode has you playing the levels, pulling off tricks and completing goals to unlock things such as new levels or stripper videos. The goals are of the odd variety, including things like collecting yellow snow for an icecream man, or gathering empty cans for a homeless guy. Also have to watch out for a health bar which accounts for your injuries and can make you start over levels if you run out of it.

Do well enough in the game and you unlock a topless mode, where the riders are all.. well.. 

There's also a 'create-a-ride' mode, and a two player split screen option, with different games of its own. The game plays on Acclaim's own Dave Mirra series' engine.</desc>

In this platforming quest, you will be aided by your use of bombs, and by Charaboms, creatures that you find that have their own special abilities that will help you progress through the game. After feeding a Charabom it will evolve, which will then make it more powerful. There are many types of Bombs and Charaboms to find throughout the single-player adventure.

Jetters also contains the classic Bomberman 4-player battles in which you and up to 3 friends basically blast each other with bombs until only 1 Bomberman remains. There is a revenge feature which keeps you in the action even after you lose. If you get blown up by a bomb, you appear on the exterior of the arena and can shoot bombs at players in the game, making sure that you can always be a part of the action.

There are 8 main battle arenas and many different types of multi-player battles. Bomberman Jetters was also originally released as a budget title for only $19.99, which made it less than half the price of most games when they first come out.</desc>

There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA.  There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups.  However, they are not based on real makes and models.

One notable feature of Burnout is the "Burn Meter."  The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners.  Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.</desc>

		<name>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2</name>
		<desc>Activision's popular CABELA series is great for hunters in the off-season, and the 2006 entry in the series, CABELAS DANGEROUS HUNTS 2 for the Game Cube, offers yet another great adventure in the outdoors. As usual, players will be traveling the world looking for the biggest and most dangerous game, which includes wolves, cougars, bears, and even polar bears. This time, the game takes players through Australia, Africa, Alaska, and even to the frozen tundra of Siberia as they stalk the most wanted game. Players will have several options when it comes to choosing guns, bullets, and other accessories. Animal calls, traps, decoys, and bait are all available for sell and use in the wild. As players move through the single player missions, however, they will be given tasks other than just hunting down specific game. Some levels require players to keep wild animals away from a camp, save lost hikers from grizzly bears, or help an injured forest ranger get back to town. One of the most interesting additions to the game is the inclusion of slow motion time. Players can slow down time to line up that perfect shot. Slow motion time only lasts for a few seconds, however, so players still have to be quick on aiming and firing. CABELAS hunting games are always great, and CABELAS DANGEROUS HUNTS 2 is no exception. Gamers looking for the next big challenge in virtual hunting won't be disappointed.</desc>

		<name>Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO : Millionaire Fighting 2001</name>
		<desc>Capcom VS SNK 2 is composed almost entirely of classic Street Fighter and SNK fighting techniques, which means lots of charge moves, half and quarter circles, and super moves. What's new to the game are the different "grooves," or fighting styles. Although the "Capcom" and "SNK" grooves were introduced in a previous game, Capcom VS SNK 2 takes this concept a step further by introducing six different grooves: C, A, P, S, N, and K. Depending on which groove you choose, the type and number of fighting techniques you have available changes, with half of the grooves leaning towards traditional Capcom fighting and the other half leaning towards SNK-styled battle. The difference between the two fighting styles is mainly the availability of certain non-lethal moves such as air blocks, dodging, and rolling, with each groove having its own balanced mixture of the said moves.</desc>

		<name>Chaos Field</name>
		<desc>Chaos Field is a top-down space shooter similar in concept to the Gradius series, or Ikaruga. You control one of three ships, each with their own pilot and unique weapon systems. 

The game takes place over 5 phases, in each phase you face a number of boss battles. Unlike other games if this genre, almost the entire game is composed of boss battles, each boss requiring a different strategy to defeat. 

The game also uses a unique in-game difficulty adjuster. Called "fields", you can play in either Order or Chaos. Compared to Order, the Chaos Field offers you increased fire power and abilities, but also does the same for your enemies. Order Field is more relaxed on both sides. If you can play in the Chaos Field, you stand to gain substantially more points.</desc>

To do that, Chibi must walk around the home and clean it up, interact with other machines and people, and even -- according to the storyline - stop a group of bumbling thieves from making off with precious valuables. An electricity counter located in the bottom-right corner of the screen constantly counts down. When Chibi is getting low, players will want to recharge. The game features a day and night system, where days last about 10 minutes and nights the same. The environments slightly change depending on the time of day. For instance, a character not available in the day might be sleeping on the couch at night, and robots normally roaming the level in the afternoon might be gone in the evening.</desc>

		<name>Crazy Taxi</name>
		<desc>Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. 

In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.

Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</desc>

Enter The Matrix casts the player as Niobe or Ghost, captain and first mate of the rebel ship Logos, respectively. Niobe is a master combatant, capable of beating up everyone in her way.  She is an excellent pilot, both in the real world and in the Matrix. Ghost is very adept at firearms, and his marksmanship is a mastery.  Both characters are very athletic, and throughout the game the player will have to walk, run, jump, strafe, peek, run on walls, climb ladders and pipes, and fight various enemies.

Available weapons include a security pistol, an automatic pistol, a submachine gun, a machine gun, a shotgun and grenades.  Besides weapons, a variety of hand-to-hand moves are available, from punches, throws and grabs to kicks and chokes. Throughout the game,the player will be called upon to utilize Focus moves, which is basically bullet time from the films. When Focused, time slows to a crawl, allowing the player to zoom around enemies, dodge bullets, and jump to avoid oncoming obstacles.

The game was written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, and its plot is intertwined with that of the second movie, The Matrix Reloaded.</desc>

		<desc>In the war to save Zion, what part will you play?

Enter The Matrix casts the player as Niobe or Ghost, captain and first mate of the rebel ship Logos, respectively. Niobe is a master combatant, capable of beating up everyone in her way.  She is an excellent pilot, both in the real world and in the Matrix. Ghost is very adept at firearms, and his marksmanship is a mastery.  Both characters are very athletic, and throughout the game the player will have to walk, run, jump, strafe, peek, run on walls, climb ladders and pipes, and fight various enemies.

Available weapons include a security pistol, an automatic pistol, a submachine gun, a machine gun, a shotgun and grenades.  Besides weapons, a variety of hand-to-hand moves are available, from punches, throws and grabs to kicks and chokes. Throughout the game,the player will be called upon to utilize Focus moves, which is basically bullet time from the films. When Focused, time slows to a crawl, allowing the player to zoom around enemies, dodge bullets, and jump to avoid oncoming obstacles.

The game was written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, and its plot is intertwined with that of the second movie, The Matrix Reloaded.</desc>

There are five male non-player characters to pursue -- which of course comes in addition to all the standard farm work, tending to crops, expanding the house, and taking care of farm animals. Like its predecessor, the game can be linked up with the Game Boy Advance installment in the series.</desc>

		<desc>Special forces S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team's helicopter malfunctioned and crashed during their mission, disappearing into the Arklay Mountains. This and what happens to them is told in the story of Resident Evil Zero. Now, S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team is sent on a mission to investigate a series of murders around Raccoon Forest. Spotting the Bravo team's helicopter, or what's left of it, they land nearby and investigate the surrounding area. Unaware of what they might expect, one member is attacked and devoured by zombified dobermans. The rest of the team, with a little bit of luck, find shelter in a nearby mansion, not knowing it was probably better to stay out.

You play the entire game with one of the two selectable characters, Chris Redfield, or Jill Valentine. The starting point is the lobby of the mansion the three surviving S.T.A.R.S. members just stepped in. After a short while, the team decides to split and search for any possible survivors or anything useful that may help them break out of this dreadful place. To their amazement, they encountered an enemy they never were trained to confront, zombies. There is only one mission to be considered now: survival.

The game is largely a remake of the original Resident Evil for the PlayStation, with some additions. While the floorplan of the returning locations is almost entirely unchanged, several new areas have been added in, extending your stay in the mansion. A new enemy, Lisa, has been added to the game, making your trips outside of the mansion much more dangerous. Finally killing a zombie is now no longer good enough to put them to rest. They must be destroyed totally with fire or else they will rise again; faster, deadlier, and madder than before.</desc>

Claire Redfield, the younger sister of Chris, and Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop on his first day of the job, arrive in the sleepy midwestern town of Raccoon City only to find the city in flaming ruins due to the inhabitants having been transformed into mindless flesh-eating freaks.

Seeking refuge within the Raccoon City police station, each character must find a way to escape from the nightmare while solving the mystery of what happened to Raccoon City.</desc>

		<desc>Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter.

Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third person perspective, the game features a new "behind the back" movement camera angle and an "over the shoulder" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. 

The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous "merchant" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.

The game also includes a mode called Separate Ways (which is not included on the original GameCube release and was added to later platforms only) similar to Resident Evil 2's game A/B system, where the player must play the game through the eyes of Ada Wong. There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as character such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.</desc>

		<desc>Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter.

Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third person perspective, the game features a new "behind the back" movement camera angle and an "over the shoulder" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. 

The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold.

		<desc>Road Trip: The Arcade Edition is the GameCube edition in the Road Trip series of racing games. This game allows you to race tiny little toy cars around various oversized environments. Most of the cars resemble super-deformed versions of popular automobiles, but the actual model names are not used. There are dozens of tiny cars to collect.

Some of the tracks in this game appear to be scaled to the size of your racer, others take place in oversized real-world environments, like a house or a garden.
The usual racing game modes are present, single race, championship, and multi-player. Winning races allows you to purchase upgrades and other vehicles.</desc>

Like the RPGs of old, Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior, the basic idea is to send a player out into the world to slay groups of enemies, gain experience, buy weapons and items, and accomplish something grand. As lead character Vyse and his trusty female sidekick, Aika, you dock one of the evil Valuan's ships to take it over and grab some loot. As members of the Blue Rogues -- pirates that in Robin Hood fashion give to the poor and steal from the corrupted rich -- it's your whole life. In the process, you stumble into more than you bargained for. The actual gameplay itself revolves around several different devices: turn-based ground and air battles, airship-to-airship duels, and real-time 3D exploration.</desc>

		<desc>Sonic Heroes is a 3D action-platformer in which the player takes control of a team of 3 characters, each with a special ability - speed, fly and power. The objective of the game is to race through levels as quickly as possible whilst defeating enemies and collecting rings. Your time, rings and enemies defeated make up a point system, and more points mean a higher rank on the level. There are 4 teams of characters each with their own changes to the gameplay:
Team Sonic is the intermediate difficulty featuring Sonic (speed), Tails (fly) and Knuckles (power).
Team Shadow is the hard difficulty featuring Shadow (speed), Rogue (fly) and E-123 Omega (power).
Team Rose is the easy difficulty featuring Amy (speed), Cream (fly) and Big (power).
Team Chaotix features new mission-based objectives with Espio (speed), Charmy (fly) and Vector (power).</desc>

		<desc>Mario, Princess Peach, Toadsworth, and Toad have come to Isle Delfino for some relaxation. Upon arrival, however, they discover the island has been polluted causing its energy source, the Shine Sprites, to disappear. The culprit is similar in appearance to Mario, who is blamed for the mess, so the portly plumber is forced to clean up the island. Mario is given an invention called FLUDD (a backpack with several water nozzles) to help him clean up graffiti and mud and capture the real villain. Gameplay features a combination of action and puzzle solving, with numerous stages and multiple episodes to each stage, and plenty of hidden secrets and surprises.</desc>

		<name>Wwe Wrestlemania Xix</name>
		<desc>WWE Wrestlemania XIX is the second WWE wrestling game for the Gamecube and the third edition in the Wrestlemania series for Nintendo consoles. 

It features a number of additions and improvements on the previous game, such as improved graphics, more realistic moves, the latest WWE Superstars, and, most importantly, a brand new story mode that sees your created wrestler attempting to destory Vince's wrestling empire as he prepares for Wrestlemania. 

Wrestlemania XIX features a highly customisable Create-a-Wrestler mode that allows you to modify every little nuance of your own WWE Superstar. It also includes a brand new Create-an-Entrance mode that gives you more control over your Superstar's ring entrance than any wrestling game to date.

Also included is WWE Shopzone (TM), in which you can spend the money you've earned in the Story mode on new attire, weapons, moves, or ability points to increase the strength of your created Superstar.</desc>
