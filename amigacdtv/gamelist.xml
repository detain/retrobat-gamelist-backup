		<name>All Dogs Go to Heaven</name>
		<desc>This game consists of ten arcade mini-games based on the Don Bluth animated movie with the main characters voiced by Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLouise. Charlie the dog, a good guy but a bit of a scoundrel, is bumped off by an evil 'crime lord' of a dog and ends up in heaven but yearns to go back to earth to set things right. The game starts there, if you play the story mode. Plot points from the movie are used to loosely tie the mini-games together, but you can also pick your own game.

Among the different mini-games, there's a Hangman clone, a session of The Towers of Hanoi, a run around the city to try to find the girl's house, a maze-crawl through a ventilation system, and a Rat Race that pits you as a rat called Squad Car trying to win a race against three to five other rats. There are three difficulty levels to choose from.</desc>

		<name>Defender Of The Crown 2</name>
		<desc>Defender of the Crown puts the player in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, the game starts with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight and defeat the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

In addition to the basic ' build your army and conquer your opponents' the game offers several events and options that can be used to fine tune your play style: You may engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse, gaining either fame or land, or you can go raid a castle for loot or the hand of a princess, joining your houses and territories.</desc>

Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.</desc>

		<desc>A top-down space shooter that was different from most others at the time in that it did not just scroll continuously in one direction, but could scroll at different speeds in all possible directions on the X and Y axis, on the player's whim.

The game takes place above the surface of a ruined, devastated planet: each level starts within a large area, in which your ship has free movement. Avoiding surface hazards, such as auto-aiming turrets, the goal is to destroy enemy spacecraft that hover around the large area in groups. Each wave of attacks is followed by a bomb-dropping mothership, which you must hurry up and destroy before it moves off the playfield, in order to proceed to the next wave; the last mothership gives way to the boss - a gigantic spacecraft that will chase you around the playfield. Beaten it? you are transported to a short section of standard shooter fare, where the screen auto-scrolls vertically, at the end of which you face a final monstrosity. This ends the level - on to the next one.

Absorbing enemy fire will deplete your power, while collecting power-ups and destroying turrets can bring it back up somewhat. At 0% power, the game is over - although you may get an option to continue, based on how far you got.</desc>

		<name>The Curse Of Ra</name>
		<desc>The Curse of Ra is a Puzzle game, developed by Cybestyle and published by Rainbow Arts, which was released in Europe in 1990.

Player (Scarab) has to escape a pyramid by solving the riddles. The player needs to remove all stones on a board by finding a counterpart. Only two stones with the same symbol can be removed at a time and they have to be on a straight line, horizontally or vertically. The game starts with Scarab on an ankh and that item has to be returned upon completion. Moving a stone is done by sitting on one and moving it towards the counterpart. Not all stones can be moved however and there are teleporters, obstructions and diversions to make it more difficult. There are also traps and for instance ice that forces Scarab to move in a single direction. When the stones are aligned, pressing fire matches them and they disappear.

The game can be played in a Logic or in an Arcade mode. Logic mode offers 100 levels with no time limit. Special stones can make the playerâ€™s life easier or harder. In Arcade mode the player has to complete a level within a certain amount of time. Special coins can be used to buy extras after each level, such as ability to fly for 30 seconds, more time, extra lives and others. Levels are generated at random. The Arcade mode has a high score table. Demo mode shows the usage of all the different stones found in the game. This is a sort of non-playable tutorial. The game also provides a level editor.</desc>

A submarine, controlled by the player, is shrunk and needs to reach the brain through three levels. The enemies, which lower the energy bar when touched, are the human defense systems like antibody cells.

Besides shooting enemies, there are also various passages in which the player needs to guide the submarine through narrow corridors without touching the environment. On the way the player needs to collect nine circuit boards required to destroy the blood cot; those may be hidden in dead ends or alternate ways. This means the player can move back and forth to try other routes at forks. It is important to pick up oxygen and fuel canisters in order to keep the submarine functional. Shield energy can be refilled by killing three enemies without missing a shot.</desc>

		<name>Parasol Stars - Rainbow Islands 2</name>
		<desc>This sequel to Rainbow Islands sees a return to the gameplay of Bubble Bobble, but with Bub and Bob in their now-human forms.

The boys must clear a series of screens of bad guys - who take slightly more esoteric forms than the angry caterpillars from Rainbow Islands - and again pick up a whole bunch of power-ups.

But this time they're armed with umbrellas! Oh, okay then, parasols</desc>

		<desc>This tennis simulation uses a top-down scrolling perspective. You are not in control of the player's motion, but once he gets close to the ball, shot selection is down to you. Standard shots plus topspin, lobs and stop volleys are available, by pushing the joystick in the right direction as you aim the shot.

The game supports up to 16 players in singles matches on a variety of court surfaces.  It includes all of the major world tournaments - the four Grand Slam events at Melbourne, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and New York, plus the Davis Cup and Masters events.

		<name>Battlestorm</name>
		<desc>A top-down space shooter that was different from most others at the time in that it did not just scroll continuously in one direction, but could scroll at different speeds in all possible directions on the X and Y axis, on the player's whim.

The game takes place above the surface of a ruined, devastated planet: each level starts within a large area, in which your ship has free movement. Avoiding surface hazards, such as auto-aiming turrets, the goal is to destroy enemy spacecraft that hover around the large area in groups. Each wave of attacks is followed by a bomb-dropping mothership, which you must hurry up and destroy before it moves off the playfield, in order to proceed to the next wave; the last mothership gives way to the boss - a gigantic spacecraft that will chase you around the playfield. Beaten it? you are transported to a short section of standard shooter fare, where the screen auto-scrolls vertically, at the end of which you face a final monstrosity. This ends the level - on to the next one.

Absorbing enemy fire will deplete your power, while collecting power-ups and destroying turrets can bring it back up somewhat. At 0% power, the game is over - although you may get an option to continue, based on how far you got.</desc>

		<name>Chaos in Andromeda - Eyes of the Eagle</name>
		<desc>Chaos in Andromeda: Eyes of the Eagle is set in the 22. century. The player has an important mission, named "Eyes of the Eagle", to accomplish: Visit the planet Andromeda in order to free a kidnapped scientist. Needless to say, the fate of the galaxy depends on it.

The most important part is exploring the map from a top-down perspective. Interactions with the world or in-game menus are conducted by using one of the symbols which are placed on the border around the playing screen, e.g. talking to other characters which may provide clues. Unfortunately there are also enemies roaming on the planet which, because movement happens in real-time, may be avoided or fought on a separate battle screen - later in the game helpful android can be used during combat. The player character can divide points on character statistics like strength or wisdom.</desc>

		<name>The Curse Of Ra</name>
		<desc>The Curse of Ra is a Puzzle game, developed by Cybestyle and published by Rainbow Arts, which was released in Europe in 1990.

Player (Scarab) has to escape a pyramid by solving the riddles. The player needs to remove all stones on a board by finding a counterpart. Only two stones with the same symbol can be removed at a time and they have to be on a straight line, horizontally or vertically. The game starts with Scarab on an ankh and that item has to be returned upon completion. Moving a stone is done by sitting on one and moving it towards the counterpart. Not all stones can be moved however and there are teleporters, obstructions and diversions to make it more difficult. There are also traps and for instance ice that forces Scarab to move in a single direction. When the stones are aligned, pressing fire matches them and they disappear.

The game can be played in a Logic or in an Arcade mode. Logic mode offers 100 levels with no time limit. Special stones can make the playerâ€™s life easier or harder. In Arcade mode the player has to complete a level within a certain amount of time. Special coins can be used to buy extras after each level, such as ability to fly for 30 seconds, more time, extra lives and others. Levels are generated at random. The Arcade mode has a high score table. Demo mode shows the usage of all the different stones found in the game. This is a sort of non-playable tutorial. The game also provides a level editor.</desc>

		<name>Defender Of The Crown</name>
		<desc>Defender of the Crown puts the player in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, the game starts with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight and defeat the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

In addition to the basic ' build your army and conquer your opponents' the game offers several events and options that can be used to fine tune your play style: You may engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse, gaining either fame or land, or you can go raid a castle for loot or the hand of a princess, joining your houses and territories.</desc>

		<desc>Fantastic Voyage is a side-scrolling shooter based on the 1966 movie of the same name. The scientist Jan Benes is near death because of a clot of blood in his brain. A submarine, controlled by the player, is shrunk and needs to reach the brain through three levels. The enemies, which lower the energy bar when touched, are the human defense systems like antibody cells.

Besides shooting enemies, there are also various passages in which the player needs to guide the submarine through narrow corridors without touching the environment. On the way the player needs to collect nine circuit boards required to destroy the blood cot; those may be hidden in dead ends or alternate ways. This means the player can move back and forth to try other routes at forks. It is important to pick up oxygen and fuel canisters in order to keep the submarine functional. Shield energy can be refilled by killing three enemies without missing a shot.</desc>

		<name>Prehistorik</name>
		<desc>Prehistorik is a side-view platform game with superficial similarity to Chuck Rock, although the games were developed simultaneously in different countries. You control a neanderthal who must march through hostile pre-historic environments seeking food and keeping himself safe. Some food can be found in caves, but it mainly exists in living animal forms.

These include fire-breathing Pyro-Tax dragons, the Turtosaurus, and the Bad Bat. Each of these must be clubbed to death, some taking up to 5 hits, and then walked over. Some other enemies are indestructible, with the monkeys who throw coconuts at you particularly fiendish.

You will have to complete the level within the time limit, and avoid contact with these foes. However, bombs and improved weapons can be collected, as can extra lives, time bonuses and an improved jump.</desc>

The game plays like a Point-and-Click Adventure Game, you have to use the directional pad to move the pointer, pick a direction (left, up or right) and see as FMVs happen. Sometimes it's necessary to click something in time, for example to stop the car or defend yourself from the eponymous killer.</desc>

		<desc>SimCity, later renamed SimCity Classic, is a city-building simulation video game, first released on February 2, 1989, and designed by Will Wright for the Macintosh computer. SimCity was Maxis's second product, which has since been ported into various personal computers and game consoles, and spawned several sequels including SimCity 2000 in 1993, SimCity 3000 in 1999, SimCity 4 in 2003, SimCity DS, SimCity Societies in 2007, and SimCity in 2013. Until the release of The Sims in 2000, the SimCity series was the best-selling line of computer games made by Maxis. SimCity spawned a series of Sim games.</desc>

The game supports up to 16 players in singles matches on a variety of court surfaces.  It includes all of the major world tournaments - the four Grand Slam events at Melbourne, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and New York, plus the Davis Cup and Masters events.
