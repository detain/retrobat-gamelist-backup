		<name>Alone in the Dark</name>
		<desc>Uncover the earth-shattering secret hidden in New York's iconic Central Park in Alone In The Dark. History records that Central Park was built on a useless swamp, yet as the New York City skyline hurtled towards the sky over the last 150 years, making the city the most expensive real estate in the world, the park has remained untouched. Why? Civic pride? Perhaps, but the recent strange happenings in and around the park are casting doubt on that, doubts that require investigating. Edward Carnby, Paranormal Investigator is looking for answers to the strange events and horrific creatures reported in and around the park, but gets more than he bargained for when all the mysteries and terrors of the park spill out over the course of one apocalyptic night. It's your task to avoid the new frightening dangers of the park as you search for the answers to what these supernatural occurrences mean and why they are happening.</desc>

		<name>Band Hero</name>
		<desc>Band Hero  is a karaoke/rhythm based game, similar to the Guitar Hero games, but directed at the pop loving teenage crowd, as well as a more group based party game (unlike with guitar hero, full band instruments are included from the beginning of the series).

The instruments are the same as in the more recent GH games. You have the microphone for vocals, guitars for either lead or bass guitar and the drum kits for drumming along. Accordingly, each instrument has its own 'career' path in game.

If you are doing the vocals for your band, you have to sing along in time to the music, matching the pitch as closely as possible. Lead and bass guitar is played by holding down the fret buttons and strumming as the appropriate fret icons cross the strike line on screen. Drums are done similar to the guitars, hitting the correct drum pad's/cymbals at the correct time. The better you do, the more points you score, however if you make too many mistakes, you will fail the song.

You can either play alone on any of the instrument careers, or you can play with up to three friends on one console or online to compete with other players and bands from across the world.

Songs featured include Duran Duran's Rio, Don McLean's American Pie, Evanescence's Bring Me To Life and Queen's Crazy Little Thing Called Love.</desc>

		<name>Battalion Wars 2</name>
		<desc>This sequel to Battalion Wars plays much like its predecessor, blending real-time strategy with third-person shooting. The game's plot traces decades of war among six factions (Solar Empire, Western Frontier, Anglo Isles, Iron Legion, Tundran Territories, Xylvania), and unfolds through contemporary missions that advance the conflict and flashback missions that reveal its history.

Players control a soldier or a land, sea, or air vehicle to engage in combat directly and to command other units. The Wii Remote is used to target and fire, but selecting and ordering units is performed through conventional button presses. The Wii Nunchuk's thumbstick controls player movement, and evasive maneuvers are handled through gestures.

In the single-player campaign mode, the player assumes control of the various factions at different points in the conflict's history. The game also features three online multiplayer modes. Skirmish mode is a timed two-player match to score more points than the other player by destroying opposing units. Assault mode is a timed two-player match in which one player attempts to destroy the other player's resources and fortifications while the other defends. Co-Op mode is an untimed two-player match in which both players work together to complete special online missions that are not part of the single-player campaign. Offline local multiplayer is not supported.</desc>

		<name>Boogie</name>
		<desc>Boogie is a dance and Karaoke game.  Unlike most similar games, which use special pads to control the dancing, the Wii version makes use of the Wii remote. The nunchuck can also be used to control the facial expressions in Strike-a-pose sequences, but is not required. For karaoke, Boogie includes a USB microphone. Each song can be played as a dance or a karaoke game. Players either match the rhythm and pitch, or match the song's beats to dance. Variation and combos are encouraged, as too many similar moves will lower the score. By performing well in the dances, a Boogie meter is filled. When full the player can execute a special move. While dancing, bonus items appear such as multipliers, tokens and meter boosts.

The game features a story mode centered around an intergalactic singing and dancing competition. There are five different characters, each with a unique story. For all other modes of play, players can create custom avatars based upon the five base characters, with a chapter in the story mode for each of them. Token collected during gameplay can be traded in for new songs, stages and outfits. There is also a mode where players can manipulate the camera to record their own music videos.</desc>

		<name>Boom Blox Bash Party</name>
		<desc>Like the original BOOM BLOX game Bash Party is based around fast-paced gameplay that utilizes players' reflexes, dexterity, and problem-solving skills. During the action players use the Wii Remote to direct objects and forces toward structures made of blocks in order to knock them over. There is also Jenga like gameplay during which players pull blocks, with the goal of toppling as many of them as possible, but without bringing down the whole structure. In doing this players have to deal with the different types of blocks in play. Some of these include: gem blocks, blocks with point values attached, explosive blocks that detonate on contact, vanishing blocks that disappear when struck, wood blocks, and steel blocks. In addition, as the game progresses strategies may change, meaning that players must be flexible in order to succeed.</desc>

		<desc>Boom Blox is a action puzzle game developed in conjunction with Steven Spielberg. The objective of Boom Blox is to keep a structure made of blocks from being knocked down or to knock over a structure using the Wii Remote to throw, shoot or grab colorful character-based blocks through 300 levels through five worlds.

The game utilizes a realistic physics-based system. Depending on how a projectile is thrown and at what angle, the blocks will react accordingly, and collapse based on the real-time action.</desc>

There are a number of included courses from which to choose, each filled with jumps, ramps, and hairpin turns designed to encourage fast-paced, stunt-filled races, and players can tackle any of the tracks in "Solo Race," "Time Trial," "Championship," "Race Challenge," and "Time Challenge" modes. The design function lets gamers place hundreds of different track pieces, buildings, and environmental objects, and then join up to three players for split-screen multiplayer races.</desc>

Put your best hair forward and see if you can make the cut! Are You Ready To Get Busy? Get ready to color, shampoo, cut, blow dry, and style hair with the Wii remote. Players earn reputation and advance their career in a Hollywood based salon by meeting the demands of their glamorous and eccentric clientele, from celebrities to high-end fashion designers and world famous rock stars!

		<path>./NTSC/Cabela's Adventure Camp [SH8E52].wbfs</path>
		<name>Cabela's Adventure Camp</name>
		<desc>Crafted to be a party game, Cabela's Adventure Camp, like Cabela's Survival: Shadows of Katmai, appears as a rather unconventional Cabela's-themed title. Rather than the typical heavy emphasis on hunting, firearms, and dangerous animal species, Adventure Camp focuses on the more "outdoorsy sportsman" and camping aspects of the Cabela's brand. Here, the only hunting is with a bow and arrow, and the targets are merely cardboard shapes of animals like deer--when the targets aren't simple round concentric circles. 

There are six playable characters, all children or young teens who are "attending" a Cabela's-themed camp. Hair and clothing colors can be changed, and stats are recorded. Another child, known as Greg, exists to grief the player during some points in certain events, which includes things like dropping boulders into the river during a kayaking event. Greg takes no active role in the gameplay, rather, unusual challenges or obstacles are "blamed" on the character.

Events in the game include kayaking, skeet shooting, archery, bicycling, and others. Two somewhat more "unusual" games also exist, one of which is a form of Whack-a-Mole combined with the memorization of the classic electronic game Simon. The other is a variation on Rock-Paper-Scissors called "Bear-Hunter-Ninja" and requires the players to stand in predefined stances to pose as a Bear, a Hunter, or a Ninja. Aside from the Whack-a-Mole and Bear-Hunter-Ninja games, all the other games have at least two variations, typically a different course or set of challenges, and can be played by two to four players. Coins/Emblems can be collected in many events, along with large gems for extra points.</desc>

		<desc>With the world as their playground, players will explore a vast expanse of mountains and valleys with unprecedented choices in direction never before seen in a Cabela's hunting game. Players can climb an area to get a better angle for the shot but risk being spotted, or they can take a low elevation route with poor visibility but plenty of concealment. Nature doesn't always wait for you to make the first move as the dynamic weather and natural hazards make the hunt even more challenging. The challenge doesn't end there. Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012 ups the ante with the most realistic animals ever seen in the Cabela's series. Every animal's unique movement gives clues on what the animal will do next. In order to bag the trophies, players will have to avoid detection through cunning, skill, and deception. They must also utilize master hunting skills such as advanced stalking techniques so they can quickly move through cover and close in on their targets.</desc>

		<desc>The 2011 edition of Dangerous Hunts challenges players to conquer the world's most ferocious predators, using only their wits, their knowledge of the wilderness, and a selection of Cabela's top-quality outdoor gear. As in earlier versions of the game, the situations are more extreme than in other Cabela's hunting titles, as players find themselves in desperate kill-or-be-killed situations designed to test the skills, mettle, and luck of any would-be outdoorsman. In the game's Story Mode, players take the role of Cole Rainsford, who travels to Africa to hunt animals that have been attacking people in remote villages. Players face off against unnaturally aggressive wolves, bears, lions, crocodiles, and other dangerous beasts, in tense, first-person shooter battles. Dangerous Hunts also features a "Shooting Gallery" mode, with a number of multiplayer options. The console game is specially designed for play with the Top Shot Elite, a pump-action gun controller with an adjustable stock, designed to convey the feel of an authentic hunting rifle. The Top Shot Elite for Wii, included in the bundle package, incorporates the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers.</desc>

		<desc>Cabela's North American Adventures introduces fresh touches that hunters will appreciate, including a custom gun builder that allows players the ability to create thousands of gun options with a variety of receivers, stocks, barrels, and scopes. The game also capitalizes on the popularity of hunting shows and online videos by adding a cameraman into gameplay - to get compelling footage, hunters need to be at their best! Also, for the first time in franchise history, up to four friends can hunt together online at once (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3). Once the hunt is done, friends can share their scores through online leader boards for bragging rights.</desc>

		<name>Cabela's Survival : Shadows of Katmai</name>
		<desc>Cabela s Survival: Shadows of Katmai is a departure from typical Cabela s gaming fare in that its focus is not on hunting. Rather, Survival is designed more as an action-adventure game with Cabela s-themed hunting elements. 

The story revolves around Logan James, a private pilot flying a doctor (Doctor West) though Alaska to deliver highly important cargo to an important destination--where people s lives are at stake! Unfortunately, sans flight plan and going into a storm, the plane crash lands near Katmai Mountain and forces the pilot to venture into an adventure to survive and escape the mountain alive and with their important cargo intact. Wild animals such as bears, wolves, cougars and even birds threaten survival, and require the pilot to dredge up any hunting and survival skills he has. 

The game is designed to be compatible with the Top Shot Elite gun peripheral, and as such, there is a targeting cursor onscreen that the player uses to hunt or even use some equipment, with all the aiming done manually with the Top Shot Elite. With a controller, the targeting cursor is controlled in a manner similar to a Third-Person Shooter. The player has the ability to perform "Focus Shots" which slow down time and allow for visible placement of internal organs of the animal being hunted or defended against.</desc>

		<desc>CALLING brings new heights to the horror genre, with a breath-taking control system that immerses the player into its nightmare scenario. The player begins the game trapped in a strange room, with the Wii Remote doubling as the on-screen protagonist?s mobile phone. Using a torch to scour the dimly-lit area, players will also receive mysterious calls to their handset, which are answered by raising the Wii Remote to their ear. From this simple basis, CALLING then ramps up the fear, as a ghostly voice speaks directly to the user?The story revolved around the urban legend of the ?Page of Black? website. Rumour has it that anyone accessing the site will die from a coma brought on by an unknown cause. The site is a simple black page with a numeric counter in the centre, but is linked to a low-key chat room. Not everyone can enter the chat room, but on doing so, the player?s psyche starts to receive calls from ?Abyss?,. They then enter a state of limbo in a place known as ?Border? which is seemingly located between life and death.There are several areas in the ?Border?, and they are inhabited by Spirits which start contacting its various feelings via the user?s mobile phone. Occasionally, these spirits will also attack the player. As such, while avoiding their attacks, the user must attempt to solve the mysteries of ?Border? and has to seek an escape route.CALLING is a horror title like no other. The fear generated by the received phone calls and the eerie location serve to create a tense, nightmarish situation. A clever mix of exploration and puzzle-solving is called into play, while the claustrophobic locations hide secrets and danger within their many shadows. From the moment the first, crackling call is received, CALLING will scare the player and make them wary of picking up the phone?</desc>

		<path>./NTSC/Cartoon Network Punch time Explosion XL [SQLE4Z].wbfs</path>
		<name>Cartoon Network : Punch Time Explosion XL</name>
		<desc>This is a mascot brawler fighting game bringing together several playable and assist characters from the Cartoon Network Multiverse in one epic battle that plays very similar to the Super Smash Bros. series. Up to 4 players (human or CPU controlled) can control a character and fight on a multi-tiered 2D stage. Players may use various items that appear randomly to get the fighting edge over their opponent. Additionally, the stage may use set elements in order to take out other players. For example, in the Dexter s Lab Stage players can pull 2 different levers, one setting off a conveyor belt, and the other firing a deadly laser.

When players strike one another, glowing cubes will fall out of them. If players collect enough of these cubes, they will fill up their special meter that, when full, unleashes a powerful "Punch Time Explosion" (the equivalent of a Final Smash in Super Smash Bros. Brawl) attack against their opponents. For example, Ben Tennyson turns into Ultimate Humungosaur and launches missiles all over the stage.

In the XL version, fighting characters can team up with certain assist characters (the equivalents of Assist Trophies) and do Synergy attacks. For example, Madame Foster brings a plate of cookies to the arena, Chowder eats them, turning fat, and Madame Foster rolls him around the stage.

Each playable character has their own special move set that uses different elements from their respective TV shows. Each has an up, down, side, and neutral attack. Most characters have a projectile attack. Captain K nuckles is the only character who has a disabling attack.</desc>

		<name>Chicken Shoot</name>
		<desc>Chicken Shoot is a gallery shooting game based on free 2003 flash game of the same name. Played from the first-person perspective, the player points the Wii remote and shoots all chickens that fly across the screen. Different kinds of guns can be picked up and every now and then enemies thrown an egg towards the screen that needs to be blown up quickly. Extra points are awarded for shooting certain background items, bombs destroy everything on the screen, food can be picked up to refill energy (Arcade) and clocks add more time (Classic).

The game uses hand-drawn graphics. There are different settings, such as the desert and Antarctica, and three game modes with different difficulty levels, but quite similar. In single-player, there is Arcade (shoot a specific number of chickens), Classic (time limit) and Catch an Egg (a mini-game where eggs need to be caught before they drop on the ground).  The first two can also be played in split-screen multiplayer.</desc>

    "Jack to Attack!" . Control, play and battle as 15 outrageous, original enemies, including titanic creatures such as Scorporilla, Ratcicle, Magamadon and Shellephant. While in control of a monster players can throw toxic stink bombs, call lightning down from the sky, fire lasers beams from their eyes or even impale enemies with a massive scorpion tail - use all of the creatures  special abilities to defeat Neo and Nina Cortex.
    Hyper-Dynamic Combat . For the first time ever, Crash now has a powerful acrobatic fighting system that includes punches and flying kicks, multiple attacks and special counter moves. Players can power-up skills to unlock new attacks and blazing combos.
    Exploration and Adventure . With an amazingly expanded move set, Crash can now interact with his world in totally new ways. Players will be able to wall-run, swing from ropes and flip off springboards . Crash can even toss Aku Aku on the ground to surf, skate, grind and shred.
    Wacky Co-Op Action . At any point in the game, a second player can join in the fun and play as Carbon-Crash to help unleash total chaos! In a totally innovative twist to co-op action gaming, Crash can even jack Carbon-Crash (or vice versa) for some hysterical Crash "jacked"-Crash mayhem.

In CrashÂ® of the Titans, players will fight a nefarious plot hatched by Crash s arch nemeses Neo and Nina Cortex to mutate the local creatures into titanic abominations. Using Crash s legendary mix of outrageous antics and daredevil bravado, players will "hijack" enemies to take control of their action and use their fearsome powers against all manner of enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Pilates is a system of exercise created in the 1920s by Joseph H. Pilates as a form of physical therapy and strength training designed to elongate your muscles rather than shorten them, leading to a lean build instead of bulking up.

Daisy Fuentes Pilates takes place on a luxurious tropical island resort. The game features 10 different exercises with three different difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate and Challenging.

This fitness application features a 3D Avatar of Daisy Fuentes who performs the exercises with the player. The application tracks player performance using the Wii remote and Wii Balance Board.

The application also features a selection of diet and exercise tips along with various extras, such as being able to choose Daisy's outfit style and color from a number of workout outfits.

Daisy Fuentes herself speaks in English and Spanish (depending on your language selection) throughout play.</desc>

		<name>Dance Dance Revolution</name>
		<desc>Dance Dance Revolution, abbreviated DDR and also known as Dancing Stage in earlier games in Europe and Australasia, and some other games in Japan, is a music video game series produced by Konami. Introduced in Japan in 1998 as part of the Bemani series, and released in North America and Europe in 1999, Dance Dance Revolution is the pioneering series of the rhythm and dance genre in video games. Players stand on a "dance platform" or stage and hit colored arrows laid out in a cross with their feet to musical and visual cues. Players are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to choose more music to play to if they receive a passing score. Dance Dance Revolution has been given much critical acclaim for its originality and stamina in the video game market. There have been dozens of arcade-based releases across several countries and hundreds of home video game console releases, promoting a music library of original songs produced by Konami's in-house artists and an eclectic set of licensed music from many different genres. The DDR series has inspired similar games such as Pump It Up by Andamiro and In the Groove by Rox</desc>

		<desc>Someone is scheduled for extinction - better hope it is not you! Hunt while being hunted in this prehistoric shooter. Take aim at some of the most ferocious beasts to ever stalk the earth. Try to bring down Pterodactyls, Raptors, Akylosauruses, Dilophosauruses, and the mighty T-Rex. Head into battle with your choice of weapon: a shotgun, machine gun, or crossbow. Confident marksmen can hunt with one weapon, while those looking to load up on firepower can hunt with two. And, since everything you're hunting is also hunting you, two just might be the better option!</desc>

		<name>Disney Infinity</name>
		<desc>Disney Infinity is an action-adventure game with physical toys, open world creation and story-driven gameplay. Characters, play-sets and other features are brought into the game using figurines and discs with the included Infinity Base. With the exception of non-humanoid characters, such as those from the Cars series, each character has a double jump and a default set of attacks, as well as an ability unique to each figure. For example, Sulley can roar to scare others whilst Violet can turn invisible. There are two main modes in this game: Play Set[4] and Toy Box.[5] Each play set is essentially a self-contained world with its own gameplay, based on a specific movie or series with recognizable characters and storylines. Characters from one world cannot enter into another world, but players can put any character together in Toy Box mode. Toy Box is a sandbox mode that players can fully customize and explore.</desc>

Hitting the left drum causes DK to move left, while hitting the right drum causes him to move right. Hitting both drums at the same time causes DK to jump. Clapping one s hands or hitting the sides of the drums also causes DK to clap, which has various consequences depending on the situation.</desc>

		<desc>Escape The Museum is a hidden object game with some elements of the adventure genre. Besides the usual gameplay mechanic of finding objects from a list by clicking on them, the game has adventure portions where the player must collect and use objects to escape from a room. These sections follow the simplified puzzle patterns of the recent Azada and Dream Chronicles games.

After each chapter, the player has to search the previous adventure levels for 10 instances of a certain object. 12 precious artifacts have to be collected throughout the game. The game keeps a score based on accuracy, time, object value and the use of hints.

There are some mini-games: paintings work like jigsaw puzzles that have to be reassembled, and scales have to be stabilized by shifting weights until they reach equilibrium.</desc>

Players rocket their trucks across dynamically changing terrain in this nitrous-injected, high-flying racer for speed junkies.

Now that move will actually affect the game in Excite Truck.* Controller as a Steering Wheel: Players hold the Wii Remote like an NES controller to control the truck. The 2 Button is the accelerator, the 1 Button is the brake, the +Control Pad is the turbo... but that's just the beginning. Tilt the Wii Remote controller right and left like a steering wheel to steer. Once the truck goes airborne, tilt the Wii Remote controller every which way to line up the wheels for landing boosts.* Dynamic Terrain: Pick up items on the courses to make the terrain deform in real time, turning innocent bumps into massive launch pads that affect not only the player's route, but that of his or her rivals. Players jump and bump their way to the highest score and highest finish.</desc>

Even though it features the normal 11 vs 11 football match like the other consoles, a new, exclusive feature was introduced called  Footii Match , which is an 8 vs 8 football match. The object of this feature is to beat certain teams from around the world and unlock their "superstar team captain". For the first time, FIFA 09 on this platform features "Manager Mode" as found on other platforms. Also for the first time ever, users can now use GameCube and Classic Controller along with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. There are two methods of playing. Firstly, All-Play is for players less experienced, as it has basic controls and the players move themselves unless a nunchuk is connected. The other method of playing is advanced play, which involves moving the player with the nunchuk and pointing the remote to the player the user wants to pass to.</desc>

		<desc>Listening to feedback and addressing gamer frustrations has become a key part of the EA SPORTS strategy to improve the FIFA franchise on an annual basis.Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive football experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA 10. Three new innovations revealed today have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA 10. The first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.FIFA 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.</desc>

		<desc>The Wii version of FIFA Soccer 11 is much more action oriented than the other versions. Besides the usual movement controls the focus lies on the new, exclusive street matches with teams of five players each. Here the player can use bound to bounce the ball - similar to hall matches. This mode has a variety of settings, e.g. a wider goal or no goalkeepers. There is even a mode in which the ball directly bounces back into the field after a goal. There are also power ups, e.g. shrinking all enemy athletes or a super shot. The career mode, in which the player creates his own athlete, deals with the rise of a street soccer player. Experience points and team boosts are earned by solving self-directed challenges.</desc>

		<name>Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</name>
		<desc>The sequel to 2005 s Path of Radiance and the tenth game in the Fire Emblem series, Radiant Dawn takes place three years after the defeat of the Daein kingdom by Crimea.

Unlike other Wii games, the main method of control is either through the classic controller or GameCube controller, since the action is wholly turn-based tactical combat, largely the same as the previous nine games. The game consists of 44 chapters and uses the same engine as Path of Radiance. There are three new weapon and magic types: Knife, Dark Magic and Strike.

The player must lead a band of heroes against the Begnion Empire s oppression of the defeated Daein, along with help from many of the heroes from Path of Radiance. The members of the Dawn group are the main heroes of the game, with a major role for Sothe, who was a child thief from the previous Fire Emblem game.</desc>

		<desc>FlingSmash is comparable to Wii Play, in that it is a title published by Nintendo to show off a bundled controller. Where Wii Play included the standard Wii Remote, FlingSmash is intended to show off the revamped Wii Remote Plus. This is essentially the Wii Remote featuring the Wii Motion Plus technology.

The game itself is a combination of pinball and table tennis; the player uses the controller to fling the ball-shaped character - Zip - into horizontally or vertically scrolling screens of blocks and items in order to smash them. Zip changes size and form in various situations, including a heavy steel ball.

The story revolves around this character, who needs to defend Sutton Island from an invader known as Omminus. There are eight regular stages to move through, each hiding five medallions for the player to find. Environments include the tops of tropical trees, grottoes under the sea, and beaches. Besides these regular stages, there are also eight extra stages and eight bonus mini-games.</desc>

		<name>Fragile Dreams : Farewell Ruins of the Moon</name>
		<desc>Fragile Dreams takes place after an apocalyptic event that wiped out most of mankind. Young Seto finds a note from his deceased grandfather urging him to travel to the red tower that lights up the night sky. Along the way he finds a young, silver haired girl Ren who drives him to journey through the ruined world in search of companionship.

Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon is an action-adventure game with light RPG elements and a focus on exploring the often desolate surroundings. Players are tasked with navigating the empty environments while fighting ghosts and obtaining items such as sketches and short stories that reveal the last moments of the lives of those lost in the great catastrophe. Seto is guided through a third-person perspective and the flashlight is one of his most important aids. Controlled through the Wii Remote it illuminates dark surroundings to interact with the environment and is needed to solve many puzzles. It can also uncover hidden enemies and often a sound through the mini speaker provides a hint about their location.

The Nunchuck is used to walk, sneak around, and crouch. It is possible to go into a first-person perspective to get a better view of the environment. Additional weapons that can be picked up during the course of the game are sticks, an iron pipe, a bow, a hammer, a bamboo sword, and a katana.</desc>

		<name>Gallop &amp; Ride!</name>
		<desc>The riding stable at the old mill is going to shine with a new gleam: the condition of the riding hall is alarming, there s a draught in the stall and no one wants to live in the guest house. But that s all in the past, because now you ve arrived and are bringing your worst rivals to the edge of despair.

Stall, riding hall and guest house will be renovated and soon you ll have enthusiastic guests who are happy to pay for their stay. With the proceeds build a new breeding stall, and soon the first foals will be frolicking with their mothers on the heath.

Later you train the foals with the longe and can sell them to interested parties whom you trust. Horse owners will also be happy to call on your services for massages for their four-legged friends. Your own horse is also in the stall and loves to go on exciting rides through the woods, on the beach and in the mountains. Once you ve trained enough, you can participate in numerous cross-country races, and each Sunday you can win a cup!

Show your rivals that by living with horses a dream can come true!

Key Features:
* Interactive riding control with Nintendo Wii Nunchuk and Wiimote over 9 challenging riding courses
* Breeding (over 100 possible combinations), foal training with the longe, horse massage
* Business simulation with horse care, building construction, training and guest hospitality aspects</desc>

		<desc>Gormiti: The Lords of Nature! features characters and locations from the popular Gormiti TV show co-produced by Marathon Media &amp; Giochi Preziosi. The action starts as a character named Razzle, while cleaning the library, accidentally knocks some old books into a Portal. These books tumble down to the 'Island of Gorm' where a never ending battle is going on between vast armies inspired by the elemental forces of nature. The books eventually land at the feet of Magmion, the evil Lava Gormiti. Magmion reads the book and learns of an old legend which talks about reuniting five sacred amulets which have been scattered across Gorm. Once reunited these amulets allow the holder to open an inter-dimensional portal to Earth! The Lords of Nature need to use all their unique powers to hinder Magmion's plans and save Earth. The game recreates the beautifully illustrated island of Gorm, where the Lords of Earth, Sea, Air and Forest are charged with stopping the evil Magmion from wreaking havoc.</desc>

		<desc>Greg Hastings Paintball 2 introduces more than 10 single and multiplayer game modes each staged in all-new, paintball locations based on actual fields around the world. Seven single-player game modes challenge the most experienced "ballers" to hone their skills and then test them against up to 19 others in seven different multiplayer game types. Whether playing alone or against others, Greg Hastings Paintball 2 ups the ante with game-changing weather conditions and field hazards including rain, wind and fog. The game also features an improved map editor along with the hottest new gear and weapons. When things are at their bleakest, players can even use the all-new cheat meter that lets them avoid elimination by successfully wiping away paint splatter before they re caught.

Serious "ballers" can even become general manager of their own 10-player team composed of more than 100 professional and amateur paintball players. Gamers can trade players, issue commands, and use their earnings from the field to build each player s individual stats, so the overall team is that much more competitive. The better the team assembled, the more tournaments a player stands to win, providing him with added cash to buy new gear, players and skill upgrades.</desc>

		<name>Guitar Hero : Metallica</name>
		<desc>Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game in the Guitar Hero series to focus on specific band, following the release of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.

This title largely borrows from the novelties introduced in Guitar Hero: World Tour, with band career modes for single or multiple players with a storyline drawn as a cartoon, competitive modes online, and the possibility to play with different instruments such as a regular guitar, a bass guitar, drums, and doing the vocals. The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game.</desc>

		<name>Guitar Hero : Van Halen</name>
		<desc>Guitar Hero: Van Halen is the third and final band-specific music rhythm game in the Guitar Hero series. As with the previous games Guitar Hero: Aerosmith and Guitar Hero: Metallica, the game features 25 songs from Van Halen along with 19 additional songs from selected artists that have been inspired by the group. The game was released in retail for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii systems on December 22, 2009, in North America, and in February 2010 for PAL regions. However, as part of a promotion with Guitar Hero 5, the game was shipped to Guitar Hero 5 purchasers in North America prior to its retail release. The game was developed by Neversoft with Underground Development assisting Neversoft on developing the Xbox 360 port and published by Activision.

The game has received mostly negative reviews from critics, most of which consider the game s quality to be greatly inferior to its predecessor, Guitar Hero: Metallica and other games of the series. The reviewers criticized the lack of former Van Halen members, Sammy Hagar, Michael Anthony and Gary Cherone, the limited tracks selected from Van Halen s discography, the selection of other tracks included in the game, and the general lack of features introduced in the previous band-centric games and Guitar Hero 5.</desc>

The game puts the player in the shoes of Mumble, a young penguin born into a nation of singing emperor penguins where each needs a heart song to attract a soul mate. And while Mumble is cursed with being the worst singer in the world, he just happens to be a great tap dancer.

Following the general story of the film, the game has you play as Mumble as he belly-sleds, dances, and swims through Antarctica on a adventure complemented by a playful and lively soundtrack. 

The game consists of 3 types of gameplay. First there is belly-sledding where you control Mumble sledding down a track trying to beat Ramon and the Amigos to the finish. Swimming will have you move Mumble around trying to avoid getting eaten by the evil leopard seal. In Dancing you have to help Mumble's footwork as he tries to impress his friends and family.</desc>

It features the ImpactCam, which lets you watch the effects of your destruction up close and personal, avoiding the long-distance  blip killing  often found in other flight games.

Players take on the role of pilot, Mike  Downtown  Hudson, who flies for the International Council s Air Force. A dictator has launched a terrorist attack - you are part of the response to fight sea and airborne enemies in an attempt to avert an international crisis. Missions take place on locations all over the world.

Heatseeker s arcade presentation includes infinite ammo, huge kill counts, a colourful, saturated look, and over-the-top characters and scenarios.

In the Wii version, players can use physical movements to control the aircraft. The plane can either be steered using the Wii remote as a pointer, or with the Nunchuk as a flight stick.</desc>

		<name>Hot Wheels : Battle Force 5</name>
		<desc>For me, Hot Wheels topped out when they released the ones that you could ram into each other and the hoods would flip to look like they had been in a real fender bender. Those were awesome, and after I had the little metal beauties, my collection of plastic tracks and four-wheeled toys began to fall by the wayside. Eventually, I was too old to care about the toys.
To try and hook a brand new generation, Hot Wheels: Battle Force 5 is being beamed onto TV sets nationwide, and in addition to the cars on toy store shelves, there s a videogame out for the Wii to make parents open their wallets and little Sammy and Suzie smile.
Pump the brakes, kids.
If you ve never heard of Hot Wheels: Battle Force 5, I have no idea why you re reading this review, but I ll bring you up to speed. Turns out Earth exists as part of a multiverse . an infinite number of alternative universes. In the other worlds are mean but intelligent animals walking on two legs (the Vandals) and robots looking to take over everything (the Sark) and they race around in cars collecting keys so that they can shoot through portals into new worlds to takeover. Out to protect Earth and all the other planets from these car-driving maniacs is the Battle Force 5, a team of six drivers in five cars that wear these futuristic suits and smash the bad guys with rides that can climb walls and transform.</desc>

During a routine weapons test in the Middle East, power-hungry militants led a violent ambush against Tony and claimed him as their prisoner. Armed with Stark Industries weaponry, Tony?s new foes demanded he construct a new ultimate weapon for them. Instead, with the help of fellow captive Yinsen, Tony built his own ultimate weapon ? a powerful suit of armor that served as the key to his heroic escape.After returning home, Tony?s near-death experience drastically altered his outlook on life. The attack against Tony ? with his own creations, no less ? inspired him to cease production of all Stark Industries weapons, despite the protests of longtime familyfriend and mentor Obadiah Stane. And that wasn?t all. Aided by his charming assistant, Pepper Potts, and equipped with a new suit even more advanced than the one used in his escape, Tony took it upon himself to destroy all Stark weapons in enemy hands ? personally. He became more than a man. He became Iron Man.Customize your suit and battle against armies of fighter jets, tanks, armored Super Villains and more.

		<name>Ju-on: The Grudge</name>
		<desc>It is said that when a person dies with a deep and burning grudge, a curse is born. When an average housewife in Nerima, Japan, was murdered in a grisly fashion, it gave rise to a curse so powerful that it threatens to kill at a pace thought unimaginable before. The curse manifests on those who encounter the curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed. Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free again. JU-ON: The Grudge is billed as the first â€œHaunted House Simulatorâ€ where accessibility and instant scares are given priority over story and game play depth. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, players move forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit hospital, and a mannequin factory. Much like a haunted house, the player must proceed forward even after being frightened.</desc>

		<name>Karaoke Revolution</name>
		<desc>Konami reveals the ultimate party game as Karaoke Revolution's75-track playlist is revealed:Karaoke Revolution uses all-new proprietary software that measures the player's vocal pitch, phrase accuracy and rhythm, as it invites users to host the ultimate karaoke party. Whether players prefer to croon with the classics, show off their prowess as David Bowie, Rod Stewart or the Jackson 5, or unleash their inner Lady Gaga and Rihanna, Karaoke Revolution has a varied playlist that will appeal to anyone.The game has a basic track list of 75 licensed songs, including the aforementioned artistes and the likes of 'I Kissed a Girl', by Katy Perry, Lily Allen's 'Smile', and '7 Things' by Miley Cyrus. Alternatively, a huge array of classics are also on offer, including 80s classics such as 'I Ran' by A Flock of Seagulls, before moving into the 90s with 'Love is a Battlefield' by Pat Benatar, R.E.M.'s 'Man on the Moon', and beyond with 'Human' by The Killers, and 'Sex on Fire' by Kings of Leon.Karaoke Revolution is also fully customisable, with every element of the game open to editing and tweaking. The game enjoys newly added venue and character editing options, including 10 new performance venues in which rising stars can add in lights, video screens and special effects to create the perfect concert. Similarly, there is an even greater selection of outfit and accessory changes. As such, players can create their own rock star and dress their avatar using the new facial and body morphing features to manipulate age, shape, body size and more.These avatars then appear on screen at the different venues, with the lyrics and notes shown at the bottom of the screen, with ratings given as the player sings - and with the virtual audiences showing their appreciation (or otherwise!) as the song progresses.In addition to the solo Career mode, Karaoke Revolution boasts a huge multi-player mode, where people can play against up to 16 rival singers - either eight online or with 15 friends. The game's multi-player mode, also allows weaker vocalists to level the playing field, by adjusting the microphone settings of their rivals to improve their chances!The Wii version of Karaoke Revolution is available with a bundled microphone or as a stand-alone product.Song List Includes: 1.

With further characters to unlock and mirrored and weathered variations of nine tracks, there will be plenty of kicking dirt. As usual there are the typical race modes including tournaments, time trials, and single races. In contrast to the two other Kawasaki racing games released by Metro3D, Kawasaki Quad Bikes is without a stunt racing game. There is also no multi-player mode for the PC version of the game while the Playstation 2 version sports a 2 player multi-player. The levels offer three different settings which are a stadium, rocky canyons, and a waterfalls/train tracks one.</desc>

		<name>King Of Clubs</name>
		<desc>King of Clubs is a crazy golf game set in Big Bubba’s run down theme park in the middle of the Nevada desert.  It features 96 holes, set in 5 different environment themes.  Each environment theme has its own resident ‘Course Pro’ resplendent in suitably themed fancy dress costume.

There are 4 single player modes (Career, Tournament, Speed Golf, Practice).  As you progress through the game, you’ll unlock special balls and clubs which enable you to play different types of shots (e.g. chip clubs, swerve clubs, rubber balls, speed balls).  Combinations of these balls and clubs then allow you to approach holes in different ways and attempt various trick shots to try and get a hole in one (which is possible on every hole).

In multi-player, you can play against up to 3 friends.  The multi-player game features specific pickups which can help you &amp; hinder your opponents as well as a ‘distraction’ feature which allows non-active players to trigger sound effects &amp; rumble the pad of the player currently taking a shot.

The game also features a ‘Pro-Shop’ where buy various gadgets to customise various elements of the game such as the colour of your ball, its trail and even the sound effects it makes when you hit it.</desc>

		<name>Kirby's Epic Yarn</name>
		<desc>While walking through Dream Land, Kirby discovers a tomato and decides to eat it. Yin-Yarn, the evil sorceror who possessed the tomato (revealed to be a Metamato), appears and magically banishes Kirby into Patch Land, a world completely made of fabric, via the sock carried around his neck. In Patch Land, Kirby s body transforms into yarn, rendering his power to inhale useless. Instead, Kirby is granted the ability to transform by the magic of the Metamato, which he uses to rescue a boy being attacked by a monster. The boy, named Prince Fluff, explains that Yin-Yarn has separated Patch Land into pieces, which was tied together by magic yarn. Kirby decides to help Prince Fluff collect all seven pieces of the yarn and restore Patch Land.

Meanwhile, Yin-Yarn captures King Dedede and Meta Knight and places them under his control. Kirby is forced to fight Dedede and Meta Knight after they ambush him in Patch Land. When Kirby and Prince Fluff finally collect all the Magic Yarn, Meta Knight, no longer under the sorceror s influence, informs Kirby that Yin-Yarn is turning Dream Land into fabric. Prince Fluff produces the second sock, its magic fully restored, and uses it to transport Kirby and himself to Dream Land; now completely made of yarn. Kirby confronts and defeats Yin-Yarn, breaking the spell and returning Dream Land and himself back to normal. Prince Fluff parts with Kirby, stating that he can visit Patch Land anytime via Yin-Yarn s magic sock.</desc>

		<desc>In Kororinpa: Marble Mania the player uses the Wiimote to roll balls through mazes by tilting it to change the angle of the maze on screen; tilt it too much, and the ball will fall off the track. Along the way there are crystals to collect and a certain number of them is needed to unlock the final door in each level in order to progress to the next. Some even unlock  secret  levels. Each level can be replayed infinitely to improve the time.

The "balls" are not really balls but cute creatures, such as a ladybug, a fluffy cat, and a watermelon. They have different characteristics e.g response time, speed, and bounciness. The mazes get increasingly complex and can require the player to turn the controller upside down. There are 50 levels in five different environments, each with specific a visual style, music, and obstacles.</desc>

		<desc>Lego Harry Potter s gameplay is similar to that of most previous Lego games, with an emphasis on collecting and exploring. Casting spells is an integral part of the gameplay, with a wide range of spells available for unlocking as the player progresses. As there are many spells available in the game, the player can use the spell wheel to select the spell. Potion-making is another integral feature; potions can help the player complete levels or, if created incorrectly, have adverse side effects such as turning the player into a frog. The game covers a wide range of characters of the last three books and four films.</desc>

		<name>LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues</name>
		<desc>Lego Indiana Jones 2 lets the player control a Lego figure in areas related to movie scenes and situations, with an emphasis on exploration and problem-solving. It can be played solo or by two people simultaneously, with the same drop in/out co-op play which has become a staple of the Lego series. The game includes adaptions of the original three Indiana Jones movies. These offer all-new levels; none of the content has been recycled from the original game. There are also bonus levels that have to be discovered and are made using the level creator. Upon finishing these levels, the player can edit them at any time.

Lego Indiana Jones 2 includes a level creator where players can create their own levels and objects. Two-player co-op mode has been enhanced with split-screen; rather than forcing both characters to always be close enough to fit on the same screen, the game will seamlessly split when characters wander apart and merge into one screen when both players are near each other. The hub has also been redesigned; where before each hub was a small area with easy access to levels which had been unlocked, now each hub is a large area in which entrances to levels must be discovered.</desc>

		<name>LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures</name>
		<desc>The game allows players to recreate moments (albeit more humorously) from the first three Indiana Jones films: Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

However, the developers modified the storylines to fit the events into 6 game chapters per movie. Barnett College, Dr. Indiana Jones  teaching location from Last Crusade (Marshall College in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), serves as the main hub of the game, and different maps on the walls allow access to each of the missions, extra unlockable content and options are found in the different classrooms. Once a player chooses a mission, a cutscene begins that introduces the section of the movie being played. Notable scenes have been recreated from the movies, such as the memorable boulder escape and the battle on the rope bridge, as well as Walter Donovan choosing the incorrect Holy Grail.</desc>

The main game has players touring around the world at various locations, like the original Rock Band games. Unlike Rock Band however, LEGO Rock Band also has special levels where you must perform outrageous tasks such as fighting an octopus or demolishing a building using your rock concert. As players make their way through the song lists, they earn "Studs", the game s currency. Studs can be used to purchase Lego items to decorate your Rock Den, hire new staff, buy new clothes or instruments.</desc>

The goal is to reunite Jake with his girlfriend Rachael, who s also trapped in the school and calls Jake from time to time on the school s phone system. Stay in the light and Jake s safe. Step into the darkness and he s pulled under.

In addition to light puzzling, the game features 5 boss battles against dark faculty members, an unlockable challenge mode, multiple endings, level select mode, and a second playable character. LIT will be released soon, exclusively on Nintendo s WiiWare platform. Until then, keep your eyes here for the latest details on this game.

		<desc>With more Europeans discovering American football every year, EA has embraced accessibility as a key feature of its Madden franchise. The previous game in the series introduced motion controls, but Madden NFL 08 is taking accessibility to the next level ? and brings it online to boot.To make American football an easier experience, EA has instituted the Family Play option. This control scheme, which can be turned on or off at any time, lets the computer take control of some of the details, letting you focus on the unique Wii Remote controls. Much like Wii Sports, players don?t control the movement of the players, only the actions like passing the football, evading tacklers by performing a stiff-arm or spin move and kicking. With only Wii Remote motions required, it?s a great way to get newcomers into the game, while more advanced players can attach a Nunchuk for complete control.Another favourite from last year?s game gets a big update in Madden NFL 08: Party Mode lets you pick a Mii and play up to three others in a variety of ways. Play Now let?s you quickly take on opponents, Mini-Games offers more than 20 motion-controlled mini-games and Trivia allows you to find out who knows most about the NFL. Every game you play affects your Mii?s ranking, adding a nice element of competition.For those who like to enjoy the full Madden experience, the biggest addition to this year?s game is that of online play. For the first time on a Nintendo platform, gamers can go head-to-head in Exhibition games and match up against other American football fans around the world, with a live sports ticker keeping you informed up-to-the-minute on scores and updates.? Players with advanced American football knowledge can take advantage of the new Read and React System. Player Weapon icons identify their on-field strengths and weaknesses, providing an immediate read on what your opponent is giving you. Quickly react, create mismatches and exploit opponent weaknesses before every play.? All-new player moves, including auto-motion, backward passes and low-hitting tackles, plus ultra-smooth gameplay provide the most realistic NFL gaming experience ever.? Like John Madden himself, use the telestrator feature to draw on the screen and point out your friends? mistakes when you earn a replay? Take on an army of tackling dummies in an all-new skill drills mini-game designed to teach you the game of American football. A progressive learning system teaches you how to use game controls under pressure, while advanced and multiplayer modes allow you to fine-tune your skills or challenge a friend to a head-to-head competition</desc>

It also introduces several new game modes and other enhancements, including a new tournament style mode called 'Madden Showdown' which encourages players to bet on the outcome of individual matchups, a new cooperative 'Season Mode', and a new passing control system that allows players to pass the pall by using the Wii Remote to point at the receiver that they wish to pass the ball to. Another addition, 'Spotlight Moments', focuses the camera on pivotal moments in the game and slows down time to allow the player to affect the outcome in various special ways.</desc>

		<desc>Major League Baseball's only cross-console video game series returns to the field with a 2010 release for Wii. Once again, a system-exclusive, motion-sensitive control system simulates the real-life actions of pitching the ball and swinging the bat. Built on the same engine as the previous year's game, the 2K10 edition of the MLB game boasts improvements in accuracy and offers new features to give players more control while pitching and hitting. The "Total Hitting Control" system allows players on offence to swing for the fences, aim for a well-placed fair ball, or foul out of play, to work against the pitcher's stamina in a full-count battle. The "Batter's Eye" feature occasionally gives players a momentary preview of a pitch will cross the plate, depending in part on the skill and accuracy of the athlete at bat.</desc>

		<desc>Mario Kart Wii is an installment of the long-running Mario Kart series, but here for the Nintendo Wii, where you take control of various Nintendo characters to race through different tracks and win the Grand Prix, using a variety of vehicles and items spread through the track to help you.

There are various additions to the series. Players can now also play with motorbikes, which can do wheelies but are lighter and can't super boost, in contrast with karts. There's 6 varieties of each for each character class to choose from, and 4 new characters have been added as well as being able to drive with your Mii. Finally, there's 16 new tracks as well as 16 returning from previous games.

Gameplay has also been modified. Drifting has been tweaked so that it's easier to use and players only get a turbo boost based on how well they perform the drift. It can be set to Manual, where players press a button to drift, or Automatic, where it's automatically triggered on curves but provides no turbo boost. Stunts can also be performed in the air to gain turbo boosts. Races have also been bolstered to support up to 12 players now.

There's 4 modes of play to choose from: Grand Prix, where you race through series of tracks in the 50cc (karts only), 100cc (bikes only) and 150cc (karts and bikes) cups; Time Trial, where you take on ghost replays and try to finish in the least time; Versus, where you race against opponents on a single track; and Battle, where you can compete against your foes in either hitting them with weapons or collecting coins.

Multiplayer is also supported, allowing up to 4 players in hotseat and 12 online on Nintendo Wi-Fi, where you can take on strangers and friends (with Friend Codes) in any game mode, play in competitions, beat other's ghost replays or check online rankings. The game can be played using a Wii Wheel (included), Wii Remote, Nunchuck, Classic Controller, or Gamecube Controller.</desc>

		<name>Mario Party 8</name>
		<desc>Mario and friends are invited to the Star Carnival. Of course, they are thrilled to join. Whoever wins the main event, the Star Battle, receives a year's supply of candy. To win they must play through board games against each other. Mario and pals can also choose to play a more traditional party (much like other Mario Party games).

In the first Mario Party game for Wii, the basic rules are the same: players still compete to win stars. However, the mini-games have been completely revamped to take advantage of the Wii remote. For example, some have players point the remote at the screen to shoot guns or other such things. Other mini-games use the motion sensor to shake soda cans, cut logs in half, hammer nails in place, paint, fly planes, drive cars, etc. There are still others that are played more traditionally by holding the Wii remote on its side and using the control pad to move and the buttons to perform actions, such as jumping and/or punching.

Players can choose between five different modes: Party Tent, Star Battle, Mini-games, Extras Zone, or Fun Bazaar. In Party Tent mode, players play on boards with a choice between battle royales, teams, or duels. In a Battle Royale, people compete for stars: the winner is determined by number of stars and/or coins after a certain amount of turns. In Team Battle, players split off into teams. And in a duel, two players compete against each other.

Star Battle is basically a duel on each board against different characters (for one player). The player wins each board by completing a certain task. For instance, the player must collect so many stars on some boards. For other boards, he or she has to get to the star with a certain amount of coins.</desc>

		<name>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2</name>
		<desc>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and, before that, the X-Men Legends series It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose.

You start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by completing bonus simulator missions, which will give you a special task like blowing up cars. There are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they get knocked out. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. You can use SHIELD access points, usually at the beginning and middle of each level, to switch out characters. The stamina meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time.

Defeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage.

The big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. This is controlled by a meter of four stars. You fill this by defeating enemies or finding an item that instantly fills the whole meter. You can spend one star to revive a fallen teammate or all four to perform a fusion attack. Any possible combination of two characters has their own unique fusion. There are three basic types:

There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. These do high damage to a single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies.</desc>

		<name>Marvel Ultimate Alliance</name>
		<desc>Dr. Doom has united supervillains as the Masters of Evil. Now for the first time ever, over 20 Marvel superheroes including Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade and Silver Surfer have come together to stop Doom. Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.

Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team. 

You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes. 

Boss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.

The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.</desc>

		<desc>The game is based in Super Hero City and sees the Super Hero Squad battling against Dr. Doom's Lethal Legion of villains. The story is that long ago the mighty Infinity Sword was shattered and nor Dr. Doom and his minions are seeking the pieces, the Infinity Fractals. Each fractal is immensely powerful and gives whoever possesses it special powers. Super Hero City is in danger and only the Super Hero Squad can save the day!

With a story line like that the stage is set for lots of fighting, though the enemies can be targeted so players can throw objects and use long range attacks. Player(s) can either work their way through the story in Adventure Mode, or fight with other players in Battle Mode.</desc>

Each version was built from the ground up for its respective system. The Wii version was announced at Nintendo s E3 2007 Press Conference on July 11, 2007. It may not be sold to people under 18 in Germany because of its USK rating.[2] Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 is set in World War II, starting on the Normandy beaches trying to control German bunkers and then move on to secure a village somewhere in France.

This is the second Medal of Honor game to be released for the Wii. The first was Medal of Honor: Vanguard.

		<name>Monster Jam</name>
		<desc>Monster Jam is a monster truck racing game based on the existing TV-show under the same name, which also incorporates a series of live events hosted by Live Nation. Unlike previous games of Monster Jam franchise, Monster Jam includes 20 pre-existing trucks licensed specifically for the game by USHRA (United States Hot Rod Association). The game includes such well-known monster trucks as Destroyer, Bounty Hunter, Blue Thunder, Captain's Cruise, it's previous identity - Bulldozer and probably two of the most alleged kings of all monster trucks - Maximum Destruction, the winner of seven Monster Jam World Finals and Grave Digger, one of the most influential monster trucks of all time .

At the beginning of the game only a small amount of trucks and tracks is available for choosing. The player is encouraged to participate in various events to attain career points which will unlock new items. The amount of points given depend on the player's performance in the following events:

 Freestyle - a classic monster truck challenge involves free-riding at the arena performing different stunts and interacting with the surrounding environment in the most destructive way possible. In this challenge it is advisable to "keep the action going" until the time runs out. Also, a combo of different stunts in a succession will result in magnifying the score.

Track Circuit - an offroad lap-based racing through various types of countryside.

Eliminator - is the classic knock-out race in which  each lap eliminates the last truck to complete it.

Stadium Circuit - is the same as Track Circuit with the action taking the place in the arena, and not at outdoors locations and the trucks competing at different tracks separated from each other.

Stadium Racing - is a drag racing challenge in which players should boost their maximum speed in order to arrive first at the finish of a short un-circled track.

Once the sufficient number points is achieved the player will be allowed to participate in Monster Jam World Finals to prove his right to be the ultimate champion of Monster Jam.

The game makes heavy emphasis on it's fully destructible levels. Nearly everything player meets on the track may be crushed, moved or destroyed. The game encourages such kind of behavior by issuing additional points and allowing player to use "nitro boost" for a prolonged amount of time.

The game may be played in two difficulty modes: "Normal" - is enough for everyone, while "Pro" is meant for die-hard Monster Truck enthusiasts only.</desc>

		<desc>Based on ancient Japanese lore, Muramasa: The Demon Blade plunges players into the mystical Genroku era, ruled by the skilled shogun Tsunayoshi Tokogawa. But this culture is threatened; Tokogawa's thirst for power leads to a conflict over the enormously powerful, though cursed, Demon Blades. Used in hatred, drenched in blood, the cursed blades condemn those who use them to tragedy, madness and ultimately deaths. As chaos spreads, denizens from the netherworld breach their realm as these malevolent swords summon evil spirits - and the Dragon and Demon Gods as well. Featuring hand-drawn 2D art reflecting the heritage and tone of the storyline, Muramasa transports plauers into a little known mythology, envisioned by the creators of the critically acclaimed Odin Sphere. Players take on the role of a male ninja or female kunoichi, utilising their ninja prowess to traverse the clever side-scrolling levels that feature vertical progression as well as the traditional horizontal stage advancement.Features:* From the subtle movements of a character's clothes to their explosive battle animations, every detail is expertly animated by hand for amazing visuals* Playing as a male ninja or female kunoichi, a wide variety of ninja skills are at your disposal as you progress through levels horizontally and vertically* Gameplay transitions seamlessly from player-controlled elements to story sequences to keep the player engaged within the world* Take a journey through a tale influenced by the lesser-told, but equally rich and mysterious, Japanese mythology</desc>

The latest iteration of the hit fighting game represents a huge progression from the previous game, including never-before-seen modes, improved visual presentation, and polished gameplay mechanics. Using their favorite characters from VIZ Media's hit animated series Naruto, players can intensify special ninja techniques or perform "hand signs" mid-battle with the Wii remote; or opt for the Classic or the GameCube controller for a more traditional fighting game experience.</desc>

Behind the wheel as Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Gordon, or one of a dozen others, players take the power and speed of NASCAR for an off-track joyride. Forgiving physics and accelerated action encourage players to trade paint as they push fearlessly to the front of the pack, while authentic techniques such as drafting or sling-shotting earn an extra boost.</desc>

		<desc>The next release in the NBA 2K series, NBA 2K10 expands previous game modes, brings roster updates, and adds a number of new online-linked features meant to add more realism to the game.

2K10 features an improved player-creation mode that, aside from standard physical and appearance options, also includes tendencies, attitudes, dribble and dunk styles, and signature moves.  Created players can be used in the new "My Player" simulation mode, where the created basketballer rises from an undrafted rookie through the entirety of his NBA career.  This mode is a simulation in the truest sense, and players imported into it must pick a position on their team and are expected to play it accurately, unselfishly, and without deviation (no wandering the court in search of dunks and flashy superstardom).

Xbox360 and PS3 players may download the NBA 2K10 Draft Combine game to create a player and give him a head-start on skills in My Player mode. Players can also form online crews and play pick-up games that don't affect the character's schedule, but still result in experience points.

"The Association" sim mode has been expanded, allowing players to control and manage all 30 NBA teams at once, follow the realistic progress of generated players, share custom draft classes, and manage new developmental league teams.

Internet-connected consoles may elect to receive live updates through the "NBA Today" feature.  This optionally updates rosters and stats to reflect changes in the actual NBA (including trades and injuries), down to offering date-specific color commentary based on when the game is being played.

A variety of other gameplay tweaks have been made, including new dribbling and defensive controls, lockdown defense, a new stamina system, 24 active play calls, and the ability to save progress in the middle of a game and return to it later.</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay is based upon rival street racing crews. Players run a crew and can hire specific street racers to be in their crew and the active friendly racer is known as a wingman. Each hirable street racer has two skills, one which is a racing skill (scout, blocker, and drafter) and a non-race skill (fixer, mechanic, and fabricator). Each skill has different properties from finding hidden alleys/back streets (shortcuts) to reducing police attention. Cars driven by the wingmen are also different; blockers drive muscles, drafters drive exotics and scouts drive tuners (although the first two unlockable wingmen (Neville and Sal) drive cars according to the player s chosen car class at the start of the game). In career mode, players have to race tracks and win to conquer territories and face off against bosses to conquer districts.</desc>

		<name>Need For Speed Nitro</name>
		<desc>Need for Speed: Nitro is an arcade style racing game that emphasizes speed and excitement over realism or vehicle tuning. The Wii version allows up to 4 players to race, with a maximum of 8 racers at once. The Wii version lets up to 4 racers compete in a drag race.

Events feature different modes, namely circuits, team circuts, elimination races, drift challenges, speed trap challenges, drag challenges and time attacks. Career mode allows players to compete in several cups and build up a roster of vehicles, while Arcade Mode lets players immediately jump into a race with customized difficulty and race conditions.

During races, police will attempt to block and ram racers, causing damage that will reduce the players  top speed and amount of nitro available. The game features power-up icons in the race that immediately repair vehicle damage or increase your opponents heat level. During a race, players are awarded "style points" based on performing powerslides and drafting, and nitro is recharged over time.</desc>

The game s environment consists of four boroughs: Palm Harbor, Port Crescent, Gold Coast Mountains, and Sunset Hills. In the Wii and PS2 versions two boroughs are copied off Need for Speed Most Wanted and put into different positions. These four boroughs make up the city, Tri-City (referring to the real-life city in Tri-City, Oregon), presumably a city located on the Gulf Coast or on the California Coast although the city itself heavily resembles Miami.</desc>

Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies – or their fellow players.* In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote™ controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform – and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.* New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario's new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.</desc>

The game was announced on March 3, 2010, as a Wii-exclusive game.[3] It was the first game in the NHL 2K series since NHL 2K7 not to be released on the PlayStation 3, the first since NHL 2K6 not to be released on the Xbox 360, the first since NHL 2K3 to not be released on the PlayStation 2, and the last game in the NHL 2K series to be released on the Wii, as the next entry in the series is released only on iOS and Android devices.[4] Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick said that "As far as NHL, we re taking a year off on PS3 and Xbox 360 to refine, redesign and re-think".[3]

Then Vancouver Canucks forward Ryan Kesler is the cover athlete for NHL 2K11.[5]</desc>

Keeping in line with the "world of dreams" theme . it wouldn t be Nights without it . players will take control of Will and Helen, two young children each entering into Nightopia (the world of dreams) with their own back-story, emotional baggage, and inner demons that come to life though the forming of nightmares. It s a pretty simple concept overall, and with each child s five main levels you ll get a different piece of the story leading up to the same grand finale. Once they arrive in the land of dreams, each character meets up with a Nights almost instantaneously, and from there learns to meld with the mysterious creature and fly through the world of Nightopia. Along the way you ll learn of the quest to find the hidden Ideya (basically essences of the human spirit), and eventually attempt to defeat a powerful god-like creature named Wizeman and his right-hand man Reala.</desc>

		<desc>Pandora s Tower focuses on Aeron s travels into thirteen towers to break a curse on Elena that is transforming her into a beast, using his magical sword and chain. A certain set of these monsters are referred to as beasts, as their flesh can be used to temporarily reverse the effects of the curse. The primary objective of the game is to acquire the "Master Flesh" from each tower s master beast, as this is the only way to break the curse. Players only have a certain amount of time in the towers before Elena s curse worsens (displayed as a meter on the player s screen) and the player is forced to exit the tower in order to give Elena flesh; thus it is important for the player to take shortcuts in order to reach the top as well as to go back.</desc>

		<name>Phantom Brave : We Meet Again</name>
		<desc>Released in 2004 Phantom Brave revolutionized the strategy RPG genre with its unique free roaming battle fields and a unit summoning system called "CONFINE". Now Phantom Brave returns to a new console with added features and extra chapter stories. Everything from the original game will be carried over, so gamers who haven't played Phantom Brave can fully enjoy this title. The Story: A world of vast seas and small island continents, Ivoire existed in peace and harmony. Ancient mystic forces with forgotten powers now threaten the existence of man kind. Islands, once flourishing with life, now lie as empty waste lands. Remaining decadent cities are corrupted by unnatural events and violence. The shadow of darkness is slowly, but surely, engulfing the world of Ivoir. In the year of 921, in a world called Ivoire, lives Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl with a special ability to communicate with phantoms. Her ability brings resentment from others, but cheerful and optimistic Marona is not bothered. Marona believes in her parents' teachings that people will one day come to like her as long as she stays compassionate and kind. Now Marona travels throughout Ivoire with her guardian, Ash the Phantom, to resolve disputes around the world.</desc>

		<name>Pictionary</name>
		<desc>uDraw Pictionary is an art-based video game developed by Page 44 Studios and published by THQ Inc. that players can play on the uDraw GameTablet for the Nintendo Wii. The game is based on the popular board game Pictionary, in which players draw pictures based on clues from a subject and have their teammates guess what specific words the picture is supposed to represent. It was released on November 14, 2010 for the Nintendo Wii game system.

Designed as a multi-player game or party game for all ages, players can choose teams of up to four people to play. Since the uDraw GameTablet comes bundled with uDraw Studio, another art-based video game, players can familiarize themselves with how the tablet and stylus pen work before playing, as well as how to draw, color and sketch on the tablet. uDraw Pictionary includes more than 3,000 clues, with traditional Adult Clues like Object, Difficult and Action or Junior Clues like â€œAnimal Housesâ€ and â€œAt the Zooâ€ for younger players. The game differs somewhat from classic Pictionary, as the video game has new draw modes. The normal Pictionary mode lets users play the game show-style on a 3D game board with a variety of drawing tools, brushes and colors to choose from for a livelier sketching experience. Pictionary Mania has a custom game board and seven new draw modes, including Get It Straight, Shape It Up, Rotation Frustration, One Line, Ink Limit, No Peeking and Off Hand. Free Draw lets players use the drawing tools in the uDraw GameTablet to create works of art.</desc>

		<desc>In this game players will fight through creature-filled areas like a murky swamp, an underwater city, and a haunted village to ultimately face-off against the scallywag Rudebelly and retrieve their stolen treasure. It's serious business in a game that doesn't take itself too seriously: would-be pirates can ride warthogs for "drive-by style" attacks, battle hulking slug bosses and trigger meat meteor showers raining down from above. These cute, but dangerous, swashbucklers will take on more than 40 diverse enemies - including skeletons, slimefish, mummies and lots of other nasties that want to ruin an otherwise pleasant Caribbean adventure. Good thing players have cool combo attacks and a bounty of weapons, from razor-sharp meat cleavers to flaming axes, to ensure that mowing down monsters never gets old! Players can also use the environment to their advantage by picking up rocks and barrels to hurl or simply snatching up the baddies themselves to toss them overboard. As players progress, they'll gain XP points that will earn them perks and upgrades that will cause more damage to enemies. In addition, Pirates PlundARRR lets 4 mates plunder together for co-op, beat-em action!</desc>

		<name>Pro Evolution Soccer 2009</name>
		<desc>PES 2009 for Wii boasts three control methods, with the intuitive 'point and drag' interface of last year's game enhanced to make defending and shooting more instinctive. Players use the Nunchuck or the Wii Remote to control the player on the ball, while they pick the player to pass to, or send them on runs into space. The system has been further refined, so that close control is improved, but two new control ideas have also been implemented.Users can now play PES 2009 using either the Classic Controller or the Wii Remote held sideways. Selecting these offers a take on the classic PES controls from other versions, with the many through balls, chips and shots allocated individual buttons on both controllers. Mixtures of these systems can also be allowed during co-op multi-player games, with users opting to use their favored system from the user-friendly menu system.Other key advances include the addition of the UEFA Champions League, the greatest club competition in European football, as a stand-alone option with all-new introductory elements, and a greatly expanded Champions Road mode. Champions Road is an incentive-based game, wherein players are rewarded for success in competitions.Players are given individual challenges, each of which is allocated a cash bonus. These range from scoring a hat-trick, to string multiple passes together, etc, and the monies raised can be invested in improving the facilities at the user's chosen club. Everything from oxygen capsules through to private jets can be bought, all of which will help entice better players to the club, while the players involved improve their experience stats during matches.PES 2009 for Wii also marks the introduction of the Master League, which has proven so popular in PES for other home gaming formats. Master League places the player in charge of a lowly team and charges them with building their reputation and success through astute signings, good on-field performances and training methods. Every aspect of overseeing a club falls under the user's jurisdiction, with success on field used to attract new talent and build a team of stars capable of succeeding in PES 2009's many cup and league competitions.PES 2009 also has a greatly improved online mode, with up to eight players competing online at once, using two consoles and with four players per Wii console.Anything up to four against four is allowed online, while offline allows for four players simultaneously. Players can also now use their Mii avatar within PES 2009's Match Mode, and within Champions Road. Miis are easily assigned in both sections, and can also be used within co-op matches.</desc>

		<desc>PES 2010 for the Nintendo format will share the cover stars in Lionel Messi and Fernando Torres. And will also boast the extensive additions to the Master League via the integration of UEFA Champions League license elements, while the Wii game's graphic elements have been further enhanced. However, Producer Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe and his dedicated team have also worked to add key gameplay advances to the new iteration.Likewise, a decisive addition to PES 2010 is an all-new game balance system that affects both attacking and defensive elements of the game. The player in possession now has 'instantaneous stamina' in addition to his overall stamina, which prevents unbeatable runs from being used as a constant tactic. Overuse of sprinting will have an adverse affect on the player's body balance and their immediate control of the ball. As in a real match, excessive attempts of trying to gain possession will drain the player's stamina, further demonstrating the Wii game's realism.Proper and timely controls within the context of match have also be given more importance. More fine and strategic controls have been given more significance, and an attacking player with the ball can perform various 'AI feints' to bypass the opposition defenders while dribbling - but is in accordance with the player's abilities. Defenders will also have to think of which areas to close down from, and work with other players to reduce the space attackers have.Greyhound has also worked hard on a new free kick system, wherein these set pieces are now viewed from the kicker's perspective and targeted using a pointer system, allowing users to add swerve and additional pace to their kicks, dependent on the taker's abilities. This level of control even allows players to move their keeper earlier in a match against human player.New animations will see players signaling for passes, and the slickest animation in a PES title on Wii yet, while the Champions Road and Master League modes mark a welcome return again. "The stakes have been raised and PES 2010 for Wii shows that Konami can still innovate and surprise," commented Akiyoshi 'Greyhound' Chosogabe. "Our control system for Wii is still regarded as the finest and most intuitive around, and we have once again reworked it to add a level of control and realism that can appeal to new and old PES fans alike."</desc>

		<desc>Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 (officially abbreviated as PES 2012 and known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 2012 in Asia) is a video game which is the eleventh edition in the Pro Evolution Soccer series developed and published by Konami (and MicroByte in Argentina) with production assistance from the Blue Sky Team. Lionel Messi, who was the cover star for the series since PES 2009, was replaced by PES 2008 cover star Cristiano Ronaldo, while Shinji Kagawa replaces Messi as the cover star for the Japanese version. The US and Latin American cover features Santos player Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo. Like previous versions of the game, it will be exclusively licensed by UEFA to contain the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Super Cup competitions along with a license from CONMEBOL to feature the Copa Santander Libertadores. Referees' governing UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Super Cup matches will wear the official UEFA Champions League uniforms, which is a first for the series. Primeira Liga were included for the first time in series with three licensed teams. On July 28, 2011, Konami confirmed that PES 2012 was going to be released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows on October 14, 2011 in Europe and October 6, 2011 in Japan. At Gamescom 2011 it was announced that the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2 versions would follow on October 28, 2011 and the Wii on November 4, 2011. The publisher has also confirmed that versions for Nintendo 3DS and iOS formats are also in development, with firm dates to follow. There are two demos, both of which were released for the PlayStation 3, PC although the Xbox 360 only had the second demo due to problems with the first one. The first is based on a preview build of the game and was released on August 24, 2011 for PlayStation 3 and PC, though because of "issues on both sides" according to Jon Murphy, PES Team Leader, it was not released on the Xbox 360. The second demo was released 14 September on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC.</desc>

		<path>./NTSC/Punch-Out! [R7PE01].wbfs</path>
		<name>Punch-Out!!</name>
		<desc>One of the biggest names in boxing returns after a 15-year hiatus. In Punch-Out!! you play as young up-and-coming fighter Little Mac who, with the help of his ringside trainer Doc Lewis, is working his way through the ranks of a wide variety of boxing caricatures, each with their own patterns of attacks. Grab a Wii Remote controller in one hand and a Nunchuk controller in the other and step back into the ring with a modern update of the classic Punch-Out!!Little Mac Is BackEveryone?s favorite underdog from the 1980s joins the best of the original Punch-Out!! cast in a modern re-imagining of the series. Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and back stories that capture all the fun and flair of the original Punch-Out!! games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!! features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in the Punch-Out!! series. Each has their own back story and patterns of attacks to learn and learns to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!! features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities, Punch-Out!! uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to play Punch-Out!! using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.</desc>

		<path>./NTSC/Puzzle Kingdoms [RZKE20].wbfs</path>
		<name>Puzzle Kingdoms</name>
		<desc>Puzzle Kingdoms is a RPG game using tile matching mini-games as the combat system of the battles, in a similar fashion to Puzzle Quest, another puzzle-based RPG with fantasy themes released in 2007 by the same developers. Instead of swapping adjacent tiles to create groups of three or more like in the earlier title, the main gameplay mechanic this time is to move columns and rows to match tiles.

The player controls a hero character, moving between waypoints in an isometric map similar to the ones found on the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is divided in campaigns, where the objective is to invade and defeat all the main cities from a kingdom to conquer it. The hero character levels up automatically after winning a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal.

The battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two fighting armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the  combatants take turns trying to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the damage against the enemy when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up at the top of the screen to unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar effect, starting the maneuver when three or more of them are lined up on the grid.

The troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the alignment with the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can retreat, a useful strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved. There are four slots below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific tiles on the grid, alter statistics and help in other ways. They are charged by making matches with tiles of their colors.

New troops can be recruited on the outposts, with money received after winning the battles. Shrines, taverns, dungeons and other special buildings have mini-games, with multiple goals like clearing the grid on a set number of turns, making a series of matches within a time limit and other similar challenges. Completing these bonus stages gives new items and upgrades.</desc>

		<name>Puzzler Collection</name>
		<desc>Puzzler Collection is a collection of thousands of puzzles in four categories: Fitword, Crossword, Sudoku and Wordsearch. In Fitword, the words shown must be placed in a grid. In Crossword, clues are given and the player must input the word that matches the description. In Sudoku, numbers are placed in a grid in such a way that no duplicates occur horizontally and vertically. In Wordsearch, the words shown have to be crossed out in a grid of letters. 

There are several game modes and difficulty levels to choose from. The Nintendo DS is held like a book during gameplay, and the player can either play lefthanded or righthanded (which determines on which side the player holds the Touch Screen).

The game has five game modes which include:

1.  Simply Puzzle, this lets the player pick any type of puzzle for a quick challenge without keeping score.
2.  Quick Blast, which offers a number of puzzles based on the amount of time the player has. This can be set to show up daily, for instance for a daily bus trip.
3.  Fast &amp; Fun, which adds a timer to increase pressure on the player.
4.  Head to Head, a two-player challenge.
5.  Tournament, in which the player solves a series of puzzles increasing in difficulty from Easy to Pro.

In the European version, all puzzles are localized.</desc>

		<desc>The Raving Rabbids Party Collection combines three hit Raving Rabbids party games for a total of over 175 crazy minigames! Included in this pack are Rayman: Raving Rabbids, Raving Rabbids 2, and Raving Rabbids TV Party.

All three games in the collection have a simple plot line of Rayman either imprisoned or escaping the Rabbids, silly looking rabbit creatures. The first game starts off with Rayman being kidnapped while at a picnic and Rabbids have him endure many types of tests that the player must complete in order for him to be set free. The next game features Rayman entering a mall trying to attack the angry Rabbids that have captured him in the previous game. In TV Party, he is running away from the Rabbids and discovers that a bolt of lightning has transferred the Rabbids into a TV set, which is the premise for the mini games.</desc>

		<name>Real Heroes : Firefighter</name>
		<desc>Real Heroes: Firefighter is a first-person shooter for the Wii, developed by Epicenter Studios and published by Conspiracy Entertainment.
The player, controlling a firefighter who the fellow firefighters refer to as Probie, uses a hose and fire extinguisher to fight flames, a halligan to pry open locked doors and vent coverings, and a fire axe to destroy obstacles. The player will work with at least one other firefighter with an extinguisher in some areas though in others, he is alone. The player has objectives to complete such as rescuing civilians or other firefighters, extinguishing all fires in an area, disabling something that causes the fire to spread, and more. The player will fail the mission and be forced to restart the mission from beginning or checkpoint if he stands too close to the fires for too long, getting electrocuted by being to close or using the hose on exposed electricity, and failing a mission objective. The player fights fires in an industrial park, a shopping mall, a neighbourhood, a tower, a museum, a robotics research facility, a bridge, and an amusement park.</desc>

		<name>Reel Fishing : Angler's Dream</name>
		<desc>Gamers head off to tranquil lakes and sandy beaches in an effort to wrangle more than 40 different kinds of fish in Reel Fishing: Angler s Dream. The game takes advantage of the Wii s motion-sensitive controls to let players cast and reel just as they would in real life, and each of the 40 fish species fights and flees like its real-world counterpart. When gamers are satisfied with their catch they can head back to the lodge, where the Fishing Master doles out expert advice and showcases the new equipment players have earned. Angler s Dream also strays into life development sim territory, because the lodge includes a number of aquariums where gamers can care for and rear their most prized catches. The ultimate goal for solo players is to track down the rare and elusive Legendary Fish, but those looking for multiplayer action can join up to three friends in the competitive "Versus" mode.</desc>

		<name>Rock Band 2</name>
		<desc>Rock Band 2 is the sequel to the 2007 musical simulation game Rock Band and offers similar gameplay. Directly competing with Guitar Hero: World Tour, the game allows different people to play together as in a band, with the same peripherals as the first game: lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set.

The new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.</desc>

		<name>Rock Band 3</name>
		<desc>Rock Band 3 is the third game in the main Rock Band series, and features numerous new additions to the original game.  As with previous games in the series, players form a band (of up to seven players) and perform a song together using guitar, bass, drums, vocals (solo or harmonies) and new to this game, keyboard.  By working together, players can maximise their scores.  Each player can fill a power bar by performing special sets of notes.  When they have enough of these, they can activate "Overdrive" which adds a x2 multiplier for each player that has Overdrive activated simultaneously (so, for example, having four players with Overdrive activate will score you x8 rather than x2 for only one person).

Vocal harmonies, first introduced in The Beatles: Rock Band, are carried over into the main Rock Band series for the first time.  Up to three players can perform on the microphone, with one player performing the lead, and the remaining players performing backing vocals.  By keeping in harmony with each other, players can earn double or triple score, depending on how many players can keep up.  The game also introduces a new style of play for each of the instruments, "Pro Mode".  Pro Mode is more accurate to actual instruments for those players who are looking for an even greater challenge - guitars have multiple buttons on the fret board and players must actually strum strings, the drums must have the three cymbal attachment, while with the keyboard, even more keys are used so that the performance is much closer to actual play.

The Career Mode of the game has also been revised for this game.  Rather than grinding to earn money to unlock new items, the game is instead based around Achievement-like "goals".  Each goal you unlock earns you more fans for your band, and often unlocks new items of clothing or instruments.  All songs are initially unlocked so that those who just want to play for fun can, while those looking for a deeper experience can tackle the "Road Challenge" mode, which has you travelling to different venues and performing song sets.  Each star you earn for a song gets transformed into "Spades" at the end of the performance, and the more Spades you earn, the more goals you unlock which again translates into even more fans and items.  Bonus Spades can be earned by performing the requested tasks at the start of each song, such as continuously deploying Overdrive, performing note streaks while you're in the spotlight, or deploying Overdrive when full and then performing note streaks.</desc>

		<name>Rogue Trooper: Quartz Zone Massacre</name>
		<desc>A planned attack on Nu Earth goes wrong when a General turns traitor resulting in the massacre of Rogue s comrades.

The game starts with Rogue and his comrades launched from a drop-ship. They come under fire from the Norts due to the information that had been leaked by the General. Upon landing the first mission is a tutorial in how to use Rogue s skills and also the Bio-chips of Gunnar and then Bagman. The third Bio-chip of Helm is received in a later mission. The Bio-chips have their own abilities. Gunnar is stuck to the side of Rogue s rifle and can be used as a sentry while Rogue flanks the enemy. Bagman provides ammunition and upgrades for Rogue s equipment made from salvage collected along the way and also looks after his health. Helm is used for accessing computer consoles and panels allowing Rogue access into prohibited areas.

Rogue works his way through the various levels as stealthily as is possible trying to take the Norts by surprise with kill moves but with the arsenal at his disposal he is quite capable of also unleashing hell and going toe to toe with the enemy. Tracking the traitor General, Rogue eventually catches up in the final mission with an abundance of Norts trying to stop him.</desc>

In these dungeons, crops of that dungeon's seasonal affiliation can be grown. The fourth dungeon, Whale Island, is omni-seasonal, and all crops can be grown there at any time.</desc>

		<desc>Family members hire you, a master in the art of safecracking, to locate the last will and testament of their deceased relative, oil tycoon and billionaire Duncan Adams, hidden somewhere within his luxurious 4-story mansion.

Exploration of the mansion is performed entirely by mouse in point-and-click fashion. As you dig for clues and puzzles to solve, you can view the environment in 360 degrees. An in-game mapping system records your progress by marking discovered puzzles with a red  X , which turns green when solved.

There are a total of 35 different safes to open which will eventually lead you to the 36th "Master" safe. The puzzles are not only about turning dials and pushing buttons. There are sliders, some based on mathematics, pattern recognition puzzles, marble mazes, and some based on inventory objects, for instance. Unlike the previous game, there is no time limit so you can take your time and reason through the dilemma at hand.</desc>

		<desc>Sakura Wars is a Strategy RPG that features a unique sim-based story system. An in-depth storyline exists, much like in any other RPG; however, the player s destiny in the game is not predetermined. Character interaction plays a major role, and your responses to the various characters in the game can ultimately change the story content and even the final outcome. The battle system is divided into two main parts; ground combat and air combat. Ground combat takes place using two-legged mechanized suits, which transform into jet fighters to take the fight to the sky. Every mech unit in the game can transform from battle mech mode to jet fighter mode during combat. Once transformed, weapons and movement methods will change as well. For example, the hero s ground mode utilizes a sword as his main weapon, but in jet mode he will use long-range missiles.</desc>

		<name>Sesame Street: Elmo's Musical Monsterpiece</name>
		<desc>Sesame Street: Elmo's Musical Monsterpiece is a new game for the Nintendo Wii and DS that kids will be able to rock out with their favorite Sesame Street characters, engaging in activities that promote musical creativity and dancing. The game also manages to throw in a few activities designed to foster development of math skills through connections between math and music. The in-game music comes from eclectic Los Angeles band Ozomatli, who use a wide range of styles in their music - ideal for kids who need a lot of variety. Ozomatli is also no stranger to lending their work to the video game world, with songs featured in many prominent sports games, so their work should feel natural on these new Nintendo Wii and DS games. The game is simple enough for toddlers to play without too much help, but there is plenty of room for parents to get involved and get in some playtime with their kids.</desc>

		<path>./NTSC/Showtime Championship Boxing [RSYE20].wbfs</path>
		<name>Showtime Championship Boxing</name>
		<desc>Named after the television boxing program airing on the US Showtime cable network, this game offers a mix of fourteen heavyweights and welterweights and four arenas to fight in (New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Chicago). Basic moves include upper block, body block, dodging left and right, short punches and powered punches (hook, jab, uppercut, bodyshot). While playing, there are a few parameters to take into account. First there is a health meter that recharges when the boxer dodges hits for some time. Punches need to be thrown strategically, as an energy bar determines the effectiveness. Too many punches deplete the bar and the amount also determines if a boxer will be able to get up when knocked down. A round timer and knockdown lights are also shown. At certain times, a power-up indicator will become available. This allows a boxer to charge a heavy punch, but the opponent will have time to react. When the charging takes too long, the punch is lost.

The different game modes (different for heavyweight and welterweight) include:

1. Single Fights (Quick): fight for only one round until one of the boxers is knocked out.

2. Single Fights (Regular): play for 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 rounds and choose to decide it by a KO, TKO or by points.

3. Points System: after each round each boxer is awarded points based on performance. At the end of a fight, or after a KO or TKO, the player with the most points wins.

4. Belts: series of three (Amateur), four (Contender) or six (Showtime) fights. Each fight lasts four rounds or three minutes and the aim is to win one of the belts.

5. King of the Ring: one boxer takes on all other boxers in his weight division in one long round.

Additional fighters are unlocked by winning competitions. Most of the modes can also be played with two players through a wireless connection (DS).</desc>

		<name>Sid Meier's Pirates!</name>
		<desc>Pirates! is a single-player, open-world game. The player receives a letter of marque authorizing service as a privateer for the Spanish Empire, the Dutch Republic, the Kingdom of England, or the French colonial empire in the Caribbean. The player's loyalties may change over the course of the game; they may also hold rank with multiple countries and may turn to piracy at any time. Gameplay is open-ended; the player may choose to attack enemy ships or towns, hunt pirates, seek buried treasure, rescue long-lost family members, or even avoid violence altogether and seek to increase their wealth through trade. The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. As the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point they are given a position in their future life, from beggar to King's adviser, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments.</desc>

		<name>Sonic Unleashed</name>
		<desc>Sonic is truly in a world-wide race against time. As the sun sets, a new adventure awakens. In this new adventure Dr. Eggman is up to his evil antics again in his quest for World domination. He unleashes a powerful ray that not only divides the world into several continents, but also unexpectedly transforms Sonic. Sonic must travel across the globe, completing action-packed stages to retrieve the power of the Chaos Emeralds to ultimately save the world and himself! A powerful new game engine delivers the tight gameplay of a 2D sidescroller in stunning, picturesque 3D environments. Sonic Unleashed takes everything you know and love about Sonic and upgrades it with spectacular scenery, new combat powers, an unexpected storyline, and, of course, blistering speed. Features include the all new powerful HEDGEHOG ENGINE that delivers a revolutionary gameplay experience, combining ultra realistic graphics with seamless transition between 3D to classic 2D high-speed action. Accelerate to super speed with Sonic Boost, avoid obstacles instantly using Quick Step, and accelerate around corners with Speed Drift. Journey and explore seven unique, rich and vibrant continents; sprint across cobbled streets or race through lush jungles on a quest to save the world. With a massive world as Sonic's new playground, follow multiple paths and routes that present different encounters, rewards and obstacles at every turn, as an unexpected storyline unfolds. Sonic's transformation brings new powers of combat and movement, giving an innovative and challenging Sonic experience.</desc>

		<name>Spectrobes Origines</name>
		<desc>Spectrobes mixes monster battling with a real-time action RPG experience, so you ll not only be managing which critter is out on the field and attacking, but also running your main character around and participating in combat the feels like a mix between classic action battle mechanics and something like Monster Hunter lite. Different weapons allow the human leads to change up styles and elemental attacks, so you can have a leaf-based blade, an electric gauntlet, ranged cannon weapons and heavier bashing melee attacks. As you progress through the game not only will your Spectrobes gain levels, but your humans will as well. It s a constant balance of progressing not only your main character, but also all of your monsters too. Tie in a search and excavate system for finding new fossils with new Spectrobes and you ve got a mechanic that is addicting enough to keep the experience moving; even if the levels themselves aren t always the most inspired areas to trek through.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars The Clone Wars: Lightsaber Duels</name>
		<desc>Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Lightsaber Duels is a fighting game based on the animated movie Star Wars: The Clone Wars which is the pilot for a TV series of the same name. The story is set between Episode II and III in which the player takes the role of either Obi-Wan, Anakin or Ahsoka Tano. During the course of the campaign he has to win one-on-one lightsaber battles against enemies like Count Doku.

The controls are designed for the unique Wii controls which means the player needs to swing his Wii remote with the correct timing and the game converts it into in-game fighting moves. If the player performs certain hit combos which are different for every character the force meter fills up which can be used to hit the enemy with powerful force attacks. From time to time there is a quicktime event if the two sabers are in content: then the players have to perform given attacks.</desc>

		<name>Super Mario Galaxy 2</name>
		<desc>Mario returns to the stars as the everlasting villain Bowser has kidnapped Princess Peach once more. This time while she was baking a cake...
Once again Mario is determined to fight Bowser and free Princess Peach. 

The basic goal of each level is to collect the golden star. The environment is still a mixture of standard Mario stages and miniature planetoids with their own orbital gravity. Throughout the game the perspective is changed at some stages, switching from 3D to 2D. The 2D part is similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii.

Super Mario Galaxy 2 features a further improved experience over its predecessor, with two new suits for Mario and the return of Yoshi. Mario's first new suit is the Cloud Suit, which allows him to create three safe but temporary platforms. The second new suite is the Rock Suit. While wearing it, Mario can roll up into a ball which will be necessary to complete some challenges.
For the first time in the franchise Yoshi will be able to wear a suit as well. By finding it, he will become "Light Yoshi" that allows him to see certain platforms that are otherwise invisible.

Like in the original Super Mario Galaxy a second player can join the experience by pointing the Wii Remote on the screen to collect coins. What is new to the game however, is that the second player now also can collect items that are out of the reach of Mario.

To aid the entry for people new to the franchise, the game features an introduction to the game play and controls of the game.</desc>

		<name>Super Mario Galaxy</name>
		<desc>Mario takes to the skies and beyond in another outing to save the Princess. As the Mushroom Kingdom prepares to celebrate the arrival of a comet that appears in the skies every hundred years, Princess Peach sends Mario an invitation to attend. As Mario arrives, Bowser and minions attack the Kingdom and once again kidnap the Princess... and her entire castle. Mario gives chase but is lost as the ship leaves the atmosphere and ends up on a space station built on the visiting comet overseen by the mysterious Rosalina. It's up to Mario to brave new galaxies, find the elusive Power Stars, and bring his friends home.

Super Mario Galaxy plays similarly to Super Mario 64, as Mario explores his latest 3D world defying gravity, crossing various terrains, and even running upside down across the planet surfaces. Bouncing from planet to planet, Mario must collect Star Bits and coins, using his usual jump attacks and spins (now controlled with movement from the Wii Remote). The Wii Remote is also used to collect out of reach Star Bits and also can be controlled by a second player.

In addition, Mario can find new suits (similar to Super Mario Bros. 3) that give him the ability to turn into the ghostly Boo Mario, the high-flying Bee Mario, launch fireballs as Fire Mario and skate across frozen lakes as Ice Mario. New challenges also await Mario including ray surfing, balancing on a high-speed ball, floating inside bubbles, and other challenges in his quest to get all 120 stars. Even Luigi lends a hand in the search, making valuable contributions to the adventure.

Players can also take a snapshot of the worlds they've completed along with their best record times and send them to their friends via Wi-Fi.</desc>

The ability to jump has given game designers another dimension in which to expand the Super Monkey Ball gameplay experience and allows gamers a whole new way to interact with the franchise; this time in true three-dimensional fashion. The Party Games return with more variety than ever. An abundance of new Party Games have been designed to take advantage of the Wii controller in a multitude of ways.

		<name>Super Paper Mario</name>
		<desc>In this action-platformer, Bowser and Peach find themselves at the wedding altar, forced into marriage by the evil Count Bleck. With this union, a void will engulf the entire universe as foretold by the book, the Dark Prognosticus. Before Luigi can stop Count Bleck, the villain escapes with an item known as the Chaos Heart. However, there is another book, called the Light Prognosticus, which can counteract the Dark Prognosticus. The Light Prognosticus foretells of a hero dressed in overalls. This hero is believed to possess the power to stop certain destruction of the universe.

Mario, joined by Peach, Bowser, and a new group of friends, must travel through eight worlds in search of Pure Hearts. Each character has a special ability, which can help the player solve the game's many puzzles. Mario can flip between the second and third dimensions in order to find items, secret pathways, and pound enemies. Peach can use her parasol to float long distances and to defend against enemy attacks. Bowser uses his fire breath to light things and to fry enemies.

Super Paper Mario does not fully depart from its RPG roots. For instance Mario and friends receive points from baddies. These points allow Mario and company to level up. Items can also be used to attack enemies or gain lives. Players collect coins to pay for more items.

Players can shake the Wii remote after jumping on bad guys but before hitting the ground to gain extra experience points. Players use Tippi, a Pixl, allowing them to point the remote at the screen to find secrets. Other Pixls, who help in other ways, can be found along the way. Pixls besides Tippi can be used by pressing the 1 button.</desc>

Normally, characters come alive in the world of Smash Bros. to do battle, then turn back into trophies when defeated. However, the Ancient Minister starts turning characters into trophies to harness their power, then detonates bombs that suck pieces of the world back into his realm of Subspace. Eventually, all the characters must work together to defeat the invading creatures from Subspace - this is accomplished by playing through side-scrolling levels.How to progress through the game: For multiplayer games, players pick characters, set rules and locations for where they want to play and then duke it out. In Solo Mode, characters play through a long, side-scrolling adventure, beating up enemies along the way as they watch short cinematics starring their favorite characters.Characters: Mario, Samus, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Solid Snake, Meta Knight, Kirby, Pikachu, Zero Suit Samus, Link, Zelda, Pit and Wario, to name just a few. Anyone and anything from a Nintendo universe could appear in this game in one form or another.Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Anything from a Nintendo game could conceivably be in this game, whether it's a musical score, an obscure item or a character that shows up to help the fighters. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is eminently customizable, so players can choose the frequency of items appearing, adjust musical scores and basically play the game however they'd like. Items range from baseball bats to proximity mines to Poké Balls to Assist Trophies, which spawn characters like Hammer Bros. and Sim City's Dr. Wright to attack others.Super Smash Brawl Tournament WinnersLA Region Winner - David SegalSF Region Winner - Jason CaroMA Region Winner - Daniel JungNY Region Winner - Jensen SantiagoTournament National ChampionDaniel Jung * This action-packed fighting game features a ridiculous number of characters that have appeared on Nintendo platforms, from Mario to Link to Pikachu ... to Solid Snake!

		<name>The Beatles Rock Band</name>
		<desc>The Beatles: Rock Band allows players to perform simulated rock music by providing up to six players with the ability to play three different controllers modeled after music instruments (a guitar controller for lead guitar and bass guitar gameplay, a drum controller and up to three microphones for vocals). Players simulate the performance of rock music by using their controllers to play scrolling on-screen notes.[2][3] For lead and bass guitar, this is accomplished by holding down colored buttons mimicking guitar frets and pushing the controller s strum bar; for drums, this requires striking the matching colored drumhead, or stepping on the pedal to simulate playing bass drum notes. When singing vocals, the player must sing in relative pitch to the original vocals. A pitch indicator displays the singer s accuracy relative to the original pitch. For songs with multi-part vocals, players need only to stay in tone with the lead singer to score points and keep their performance meter up, but players earn additional scoring bonuses when they successfully complete phrases in harmony.</desc>

Players can also receive credit for any progress made while not playing the video game, such as going for a walk or a bike ride. 
The video game also features 50 healthy recipes from the BiggestLoserClub.com and The New York Times best-selling book series The Biggest Loser to help users learn how to eat right for optimal weight loss.

All 30 teams from MLB and their stadiums are included, as well as their player rosters. The Wii version of this game is controlled by flicking the Wii remote and Nunchuk. These motion controls include drumming the remote and nunchuk when trying to speed up and using the remote as a bat when hitting.

Instead of a traditional season mode as in many other baseball simulations, in The BIGS there is a mode titled Rookie Challenge, where the player creates a ballplayer and tries to lead him and his team to the World Series. Another mode, Home Run Pinball, puts a hitter in the middle of Times Square, New York, with the aim to hit balls into windows and neon lights.</desc>

		<name>The Destiny of Zorro</name>
		<desc>Players will make an incredible action-packed journey through the sun-scorched coast and desert landscape of early 1800 s Spanish California playing as the infamous Zorro . the swashbuckling defender of the oppressed whose secret identity is the fictional wealthy caballero Don Diego de la Vega.

Using the unique properties of the Wii controller, players can whip, slice and of course perform Zorro s signature â€˜Z  slash move to bring his foes to justice.

The Destiny of Zorro draws inspiration from the Mexican, Spanish and Native Southwest American cultures prevalent in California in the early 1800 s . the time of the original Zorro. The multi-tiered story sees Zorro confronting the nefarious Calavera and his troops, defeating a plot to steal a great treasure, thwarting a power-hungry mob boss, and facing off against a rebel army.

Players will discover the secrets behind the origin of Zorro himself. The game also carries forward some of the explosive plot lines suggested by recent Zorro properties, such as the recent blockbuster Hollywood movies.</desc>

		<name>The Last Story</name>
		<desc>Embroiled in seemingly endless conflict, the Empire has been slowly weakened by the relentless onslaught of enemy forces. Despite the debilitated state of the mainland, however, a virtually impenetrable last line of defense stands proud and keeps hope alive for all the land. That beacon of hope is Lazulis Island, ruled by the renowned Count Arganan. With the employment of an army of weapons that magically ?and mysteriously-- concentrates beasts into a single region, his island has become a small wonder for its powers.

Among those coming to the island to seek their fortune is Zael, a young man who at an early age was orphaned when his homeland became one of the many victims of battle. Though he and his band of fellow mercenaries often face disdain and fear as they are perceived to be of a lower class, they manage to catch the eye of none other than Count Arganan himself. If they can successfully complete the tasks put before them by the Count, they may have a rare chance to gain the most honorable status that they have only dreamed of - knighthood.

It is during one of these missions bestowed upon them that Zael discovers a hidden site, one which grants him a wondrous and yet familiar power to gather his enemies in one place?</desc>

		<name>The Legend of Zelda : Skyward Sword</name>
		<desc>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword once again places the player in control of Link, a Hylian boy who this time around lives in the floating nation of Skyloft. Link is in love with a local girl called Zelda but one day while flying on their bird mounts, a tornado shows up out of nothing and takes Zelda away from Link. After that Link teams up with Fi, a spirit living within a sword and he descends to the long-forgotten surface to search for Zelda.

The game is structured very similar to previous Zelda games: you travel through an overworld in search of temples to visit and once in you solve a series of puzzles before fighting a boss at the end and receive the next bit of plot. The biggest change is that the overworld is more focused on puzzles this time around with only a handful of action. Also new is the implementation of the Wii Motion Plus which allows full 1:1 controls and new puzzle possibilities.</desc>

		<name>The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess</name>
		<desc>Twilight Princess is the first Legend of Zelda game for the Wii and also the last for GameCube. At first Link is a simple farm boy, whose tasks consist of herding goats to watching children in Ordon village, Link's home town. One day, Link is asked by the mayor to run an errand in Castle Town, but things sudden go wrong?

The land becomes dark, and strange creatures appear from another world called the Twilight Realm, which turns most into ghosts. Link, however, becomes a wolf. After becoming a wolf, Link is aided by Midna, a resident of the Twilight Realm. Midna helps Link find a way to turn human again along with other tasks.

The wolf cannot use a sword or other items. Instead, as a wolf Link must use his senses to solve puzzles and get past obstacles. The beast can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees and to get in places. It can push blocks with its head to climb higher or reveal hidden passageways. Additionally, it can attack enemies by biting or pouncing on them.

As a human, Link can move around quickly, aim his bow, swing his sword, and even fish. Link also collects many different items, which allow him to perform varied attacks and reach places he couldn't before. Link performs many attacks with his sword and can even learn other sword moves.

The game's art is similar to the naturalistic style of Ocarina of Time, rather than the cel-shaded look of The Wind Waker. Chronologically, the game takes place between the two aforementioned titles and quite a few locations from Ocarina of Time can be visited. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with dungeons and temples. With the help of Midna, you can easily travel around quickly later in the game.</desc>

But with war being an integral part of their lives for so long, the citizens of the world are desperate for a solution to solve this newfound peaceful life of calm and tranquility. To ease this tension and to appease its citizens, the government has started pursuing a new round of wars. These new campaigns are not a power struggle between hostile countries, but rather sponsored events between private corporations with military-trained personnel contracted by each side to do their biding for them. It is the battles fought by these war contracted corporations such as Rostock and Lautern and the constant media reports on them that satisfy and replace the basic human instinct to fight using the war as a show.The latest rookie pilot to join the Sky Crawlers, codenamed Lynx, is working his way up the ranks and becomes involved in a secret new military project with the goal of making pilots immortal. Join Lynx on his journey to conquer the skies while unraveling the mystery behind the military's covert new project.</desc>

		<name>Tiger Woods Pga Tour 07</name>
		<desc>This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts' Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise.  Although the game's features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved GameFace character creation.

Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on The Matrix films to generate digital doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands.

PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game. The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.</desc>

		<name>Tiger Woods Pga Tour 08</name>
		<desc>The 2008 edition in the Tiger Woods PGA series introduces enhancements and improvements to the previous version without major graphical or gameplay changes. There are new courses (Xbox 360/PS3: 5 new, 16 in total - PS2: 6 new, 18 in total) and different licensed professional golf players to choose from (21 on the Xbox 360/PS3 - 23 on the PS2/Wii).

The Xbox 360, PS2, PS3 and Windows versions allow players to import photos to create in-game faces on the characters based on custom images, using the Xbox Live Vision camera, PlayStation EyeToy, PlayStation Eye or a webcam. Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.

The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.

The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).

On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.</desc>

After he finds the amulet, it is revealed that Splinter was telling the story of how they stopped the four Stone Generals, and asks Donatello and Michelangelo to continue it. Once, Raph infiltrated Max Winters  tower (as Nightwatcher), and eavesdropped on a conversation with Winters and Karai. Raph was then defeated by one of the Stone Generals. Later on, Leo found out that Raph was the Nightwatcher, and a chase ensued, ending up with Leo being ambushed and captured by the Foot. Raph, feeling guilty, decides to go after the Foot. He then encounters one of the Stone Generals, and defeats her, with the help of Don and Mikey. The turtles then head off to rescue Leo, and they achieve this goal, right before the temple self-destructs. The turtles then go to Max Winter s tower, and Winters tells his story of being an immortal warrior named Yaotl. Yaotl was planning to activate a portal to another world, but it released 13 monsters into the earth. Yaotl became immortal, but it also turned his generals to stone. Yaotl then planned to stop his mistakes and his immortality by waiting for the portal to come again, and send all the monsters back to whence they came. He also made his generals come to life, but they remained in stone form. The Stone Generals wanted to live forever, so they turned on Yaotl. The turtles, however, managed to defeat the Generals, the portal opened, and the monsters returned to their dimension. Yaotl then thanks the turtles and dies happy and free from guilt. After the story, the turtles all realize the importance of family and grow closer as not only a family but also as a team.</desc>

		<desc>TrackMania: Build to Race is a racing game with a comprehensive track editor built into the game. This means the player can easily create new tracks by combining blocks of track pieces. Besides the normal straight and curved tracks there are also jumps, loopings, accelerators etc. to create custom racing challenges.

This Wii version of the long-running PC racing series includes six background environments (stadium, coast, island, desert, snow and rally), each with a different car model (respectively the racing car, coupe, sports car, normal car, pickup and mini car).

There are three modes: race mode, stunt mode and puzzle mode. In Race mode you simply have to finish a track in the fastest possible time. Each track has a predefined track record set by the programmers. There s a bronze, silver and gold medal time, which the player has to beat to earn those medals. In Stunt mode the tracks have a more acrobatic nature, and you have to finish them with as few restarts as possible. In Puzzle mode the player has to build a track connecting the fixed starting and finishing points using certain track blocks and then drive the track in the fastest time possible.</desc>

		<desc>Transformers: Cybertron Adventures features separate campaigns for the Autobots and Decepticons, but instead of being a third person shooter like War for Cybertron, this game is a rail shooter, utilizing a gameplay similar to Time Crisis series. Players must defeat a group of enemies in one area from a cover point. After all enemies are defeated, the character will move along a pre-defined path to another area, and so on. Occasionally during gameplay the character will transform into vehicle, and the player must control them to reach one point, destroying obstacles on the way. Offline co-op is also featured. The game delivers only 6 levels and a couple challenges.</desc>

		<path>./NTSC/Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen [RXIE52].wbfs</path>
		<name>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</name>
		<desc>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power.

The game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron.

Though the game doesn t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.

For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a "Remote Weapon System", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.</desc>

		<name>Transformers: The Game</name>
		<desc>Based on the 2007 movie, Transformers: The Game puts players in the role of either the Autobot or Decepticon factions in an attempt to find the AllSpark, the artifact which gave life to their race. The Autobots intend to protect it for good, while the Decepticons desire its power for evil. The two factions fought their battle on the planet Cybertron, but in an ultimate attempt to protect it, the Autobots hurled the AllSpark into space where it remained hidden on Earth. When the Decepticons discover the location, they want to finish the war on Earth.

Set in a 3D sandbox environment with possibilities to interact and destroy the environment, players can choose between the two teams, each with different story-based goals. These are set on different locations, with primary and secondary quests. The storyline for the heroic Autobots follows the plot and events of the original movie. The storyline for the villainous Decepticons, however, allows the robots to destroy both the planet and more aggressively bring an end to their foes. Players can choose characters such as Optimus Prime or Bumblebee from the list of selectable Autobots, or Megatron and Starscream from the Decepticons.

Shown from a third-person perspective, the robots can switch between a robot and a vehicle/aircraft form, jump, block, dive underground, roll, dodge, use various weapons, and climb buildings. Special actions can be unlocked through the skill tracker. By performing long slides or jumps, symbols in the tracker will light up and provide extras.

Along the way, various collectibles can be found, ranging from promo images and artwork, to playable versions of the original "Generation 1" characters. The general gameplay is identical across the different platforms, but certain features are tied to specific versions.</desc>

When the facility unexpectedly closes, they are forced to return to Concordia Medical Institute, where politics are more important than patient's lives, and doctors more concerned with image than their ministration. There they are recruited into the government organization Caduceus, where they will learn of a conspiracy with dire ramifications, and their lives will be changed forever!</desc>

		<desc>The hit Nintendo DS surgical simulator comes to Nintendo's new home console in this remake (or 'Wii-make') with vastly updated graphics, a second playable character, a new sixth chapter and new instruments to wield - this time with the Wii controllers.In Trauma Center: Second Opinion you take the role of rookie doctor Derek Stiles - a young surgeon with the extraordinary 'Healing Touch' ability - as he is enlisted into the secret Caduceus organisation to combat a deadly new disease.In the DS version you used the touch screen and stylus to perform surgical procedures but in this Wii version you can get totally hands-on by using the motion sensitive Wii Remote and Nunchuk.With a controller in each hand you will be able to manipulate more than a dozen different instruments on-screen in realistic ways; such as injecting with syringes, making incisions with scalpels, removing tumours with tweezers ('pinching' by pressing the A and B buttons together) and bringing patients back to life with a shock from the defibrillator paddles (by moving both hands forward and pressing buttons on both controllers simultaneously).By using two controllers, you can use one hand (the Nunchuk) to select instruments and the other (the Wii Remote) to wield them. This way, you can even play together with a partner by holding one controller each; one of you is the doctor and the other is the nurse! Plus, the Wii Remote's built-in rumble feature allows you to feel every delicate move you make.?Based on the hit Trauma Center: Under the Knife for Nintendo DS?Play as Dr Derek Stiles or a brand new surgeon character with a new type of Healing Touch ability?Select instruments with the Nunchuk, wield them with the Wii Remote?Use life-like motions to make incisions, perform injections, suture wounds and use the heart defibrillator?Perform new surgical procedures like repairing broken bones and transplanting organs?Brand new sixth chapter of the story, not seen in the DS version?Advanced graphics for Wii show the medical action in detail without being gory.</desc>

		<path>./NTSC/Trauma Team [SK3EEB].wbfs</path>
		<name>Trauma Team</name>
		<desc>The fifth game in the Trauma series, Trauma Team expands the series' standard surgery gameplay to include five other medical fields. The stylized  Trauma interface and Wii controls are adapted to new gameplay styles for these fields, while the series' traditional time limits have been removed to appeal to a broader audience. The player controls a unique character for each of the six modes, with each discovering a portion of an overarching storyline revealed as the game progresses.

1. Surgery returns from the previous games with few changes. Players must use quick reflexes and repeating procedures to perform various operations.  The Wii Remote is used to direct the application of various surgical tools, from applying healing gel to "pinching" with forceps to remove foreign objects. In 2-player co-op, tools are divided between the players, giving each player a distinct "role" in the surgery.

First Response is similar to surgery, but with a quick pace focused on stabilizing patients instead of treating them. Players may have multiple patients at one time, with indicators at the top of the screen showing a rough estimate of each patient's vitals. The player can switch between treating patients as each one's condition worsens. The death of a patient in this mode is not a game over, and a limited amount of losses is considered acceptable.

Diagnosis requires players to interview and examine patients in an office setting.  The player may ask questions and order tests in order to identify symptoms. Symptoms are matched up with illnesses through a computer interface, with a meter increasing as the likely cause is narrowed down. The ultimate goal is a correct identification of the patient's ailment.

Orthopedics has the player performing skeletal surgeries such as reinforcing bones and replacing artificial joints. Each surgery is done in very specific steps, with the correct tool automatically selected at each stage. The Wii Remote is used to set bones, screw in metal plates, or hammer in pins. The vitals meter is removed in this mode, and players are allowed a limited number of errors (swinging the remote too hard, missing a screw, etc) before failing the surgery. Performance is ranked by a running "chain" meter that adds multipliers for performing actions without mistakes.

Endoscopy has the player inserting and guiding a camera tube into the patient in a first-person view from the camera. Players feed the tube into the patient by pushing the Wii Remote forward, and must steer to avoid hitting the walls of the veins or cavities the tube is traveling through. After locating the goal of the surgery (tumors, lesions, etc), the player must select tools and accurately apply them as in the surgery game. In two-player mode, players switch between controlling the endoscope and aiming its light.

Forensics introduces various crime scenes the player must investigate. This mode plays similar to a traditional point-and-click adventure, with the player using the Wii Remote's pointer to locate and examine clues around the area. Players can also examine victims and perform autopsies. Clues or important points take the form of cards, which may be sent off for analysis, or combined with other cards. The player then uses these cards (or multiple choice answers) to answer questions regarding the specifics of the crime to proceed with the investigation.</desc>

		<desc>Up to four players, represented by Miis, compete against each other in a three round trivia contest. Players are given timed multiple choice answers, with players selecting their answers on their screen with the Wii Remote, with the fastest lock-ins with the correct answer resulting in bigger prize money. Players can also take their chances for greater rewards by spinning a wheel with both good and bad outcomes after each round. At the end of the third round, the two highest scoring players are pitted against each other in the Final Duel to determine the winner.

This game features an elimination version, where a wrong answer eliminates you from the competition. There is also a 2-on-2 duel version and the return of the Quiz Attack for a solo player to see how many consecutive correct answers they can achieve.</desc>

		<desc>The lands of Eldar have long been known as the origin of chaos, a place where monsters and demons wreak havoc, indiscriminate in their madness. Legend tells of how the Spirit King, whose coming was heralded in by a meteor shower, gained control of the creatures and waged an unrelenting war upon civilization. Order and life were brought to the brink of destruction, but an alliance of the four races was able to drive them back and seal the evil. Centuries more have passed and once again the lands are slowly being overrun by the reemerging monsters. Without a known cause or even a united front to repel them, it would seem that this time, Eldar will fall. It is up to the main character to take up the forgotten mantle of the hero, reunite the races, and confront the hordes of monsters.</desc>

Players need to guide a shiny ball dubbed a xorb through high-tech environments at a high speed. The tracks are narrow and it is easy to drop off at any time, so precise steering is needed.

Games can be played in an arcade mode with forking paths or in a career mode where new tracks are unlocked gradually. Courses are time-limited and set in very different environments. Checkpoint allow the player to respawn at certain sections. While playing, power-ups can be collected to access air brakes and other bonuses. The xorbs can be completely customized in terms of colour. Other game modes are time trial, three multiplayer modes and a bowling mini-game. In certain game modes the xorbs can be armed with weapons such as rockets and missiles, which also deform the xorb when taking damage.</desc>

		<desc>* Control on-screen action with your movements on the balance board as you work your way through a variety of challenges aimed at getting you off the couch and into the action. Check your Body Mass Index (BMI), see your Wii Fit Age and keep tabs on your daily progress towards a more fit for you. * Get fit with more than 40 activities and exercises, including strength training, aerobics, yoga and balance games. Whether you're doing a yoga pose or snowboarding down a slalom course, there's an activity for everyone. * Challenge your family and friends to get in shape! Create your own personal profile and set goals, test your balance, track your progress with daily workouts and unlock new exercises and activities. Create a Profile: Before you jump into doing exercises and activities, you'll start by creating your own profile. Choose a Mii, enter your height and age information, and do a few quick tests: BMI Check: BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that is the standard used by agencies such as the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Health. To check your BMI, you'll enter your height then stand on the Wii Balance Board and let it read your weight. Wii Fit Age: After you've checked your BMI, you'll do a basic balance test and find out your current Wii Fit Age. This basic balance test measures how well you can control your left and right balance. Based on the results, you'll be assigned a Wii Fit Age. Categories: Wii Fit features four main categories to choose from: Strength Training, Aerobics, Yoga and Balance Games. As you spend time exercising, you'll earn Fit Credits that unlock additional exercises and activities within these categories. Wii Fit also tracks the activities you do the most and puts them into the Favorites category. Strength Training: Put your strength to the test with muscle-toning exercises like Single Leg Extension, Sideways Leg Lift, Arm and Leg Lift, Single-Arm Stand, Torso Twists, Rowing Squat, Single Leg Twist, Lunge, Push-Up and Side Plank, Jackknife, Plank and Tricep Extension. Challenges include Push-Up Challenge, Plank Challenge and Jackknife Challenge. Aerobics: Get your heart pumping with fun, interactive Aerobic exercises like Hula Hoop®, Basic Step, Basic Run, Super Hula Hoop, Advanced Step, 2-P Run, Rhythm Boxing, Free Step and Free Run. Yoga: Work on your balance and flexibility with Yoga poses and activities like Deep Breathing, Half-Moon, Dance, Cobra, Bridge, Spinal Twist, Shoulder Stand, Warrior, Tree, Sun Salutation, Standing Knee, Palm Tree, Chair, Triangle and Downward-Facing Dog. Balance Games: Get into the action with fun, balanced-based games like Soccer Heading, Ski Slalom, Ski Jump, Table Tilt, Tightrope Walk, Balance Bubble, Penguin Slide, Snowboard Slalom and Lotus Focus. Tracking Results: Keep tabs on your daily progress with easy-to-understand graphs and charts. Using your personal profile, you can set goals, view a graph of your BMI results over time, see how many Fit Credits you've earned, check your Wii Fit Age and even enter exercise time you've done outside of Wii Fit. It's all about coming back and exercising a little every day, and the personal profile makes tracking your daily progress simple and easy. You can quickly check your Wii Fit Age and BMI without even putting the game in the console by going directly to the Wii Fit Channel. Up to eight family members can create their own profiles in Wii Fit. On the profile-selection screen, everyone in the family can see each other's recent BMI progress and Fit Credit total. This will allow families to have a friendly competition to exercise and get fit.</desc>

		<name>Wii Music</name>
		<desc>Beyond the Jam Wii Music includes many other modes besides the main band jams, including several musical games and an enhanced video playback mode for recorded jams. ? Play it again: Use the playback mode to see your jam recordings brought to life with dramatic camera angles. ? Pick up the baton: Command an orchestra in the conducting game where you?ll wave the Wii Remote controller like a conductor?s baton to lead a Mii orchestra through orchestrated music. Make them play quickly, slowly, strongly or gently. ? Ring a bell? Play a handbells game where you?ll swing your Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers to play your two handbells as part of a larger ensemble. Everyone on the team has a job to do: Play one of your notes only when the tune demands it. ? An ear for music: Take a tone quiz that tests your musical ear by giving you challenges, like putting note-playing Miis in order from lowest to highest pitch. ? Bang the drum: Play a virtual drum set in the drumming mode, the one mode in Wii Music that also uses the Wii Balance Board accessory (sold with Wii Fit?). You?ll use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers as drumsticks, and place both feet on the Wii Balance Board?which work as virtual pedals for the bass drum and hi-hat cymbal. Create a musical masterpiece with up to four players. Anyone can play the huge selection of instruments in Wii Music with simple motions?like strumming and drumming. ? It?s easy to play improv jams. Musicians in your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart?s content. Play faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more. No matter what you do, Wii Music automatically transforms your improv stylings into great music. There are no mistakes?just playing for the pure joy of playing. ? Wii controls immerse you in the music. You can play most of the 60-plus instruments in Wii Music using simple motions with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers. Strum to play guitar, banjo and sitar. Drum to play jazz drums, congas and marching drums. Hammer away to play piano, vibraphone and marimba. Unlike most music games, Wii Music doesn?t make you use complex buttons. You only need to imitate playing the instrument. ? Wii Music offers virtually endless ways to make music. You choose the song and instruments and decide whether to blaze through a rock take on classical songs, put a jazzy spin on folk tunes or transform Nintendo classics like the Super Mario Bros.® theme into Latin-flavored numbers. The song list is only a takeoff point?it?s how you improvise with the songs that matters. ? Send your band-jam recordings to Wii Friends who have Wii Music. They?ll see your Mii? band members, your players? improv styles and your instrument selections. They can watch your recordings, or play over parts of your song, then send their modified recording back to you. Improv jams can be sent back and forth over WiiConnect24 and changed again and again.</desc>

Wii Sports offers five distinct sports experiences, each using the Wii Remote controller to provide a natural, intuitive and realistic feel. To play a Wii Sports game, all you need to do is pick up a controller and get ready for the pitch, serve or that right hook. If you've played any of these sports before, you're ready for fun! Features Play Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Bowling and Boxing in the comfort of one's living room. No ball boys scurrying about, no oil from the alleys to get players dirty and no rain to keep anyone from a day at the court, park or course. Use the Wii Remote controller to mimic the actions of swinging a racket, bat or club, roll a ball down an alley or bring the left jab. Players can use their own Mii caricatures in the game and play them against their friends' Miis for a more personalized experience. As players improve, their Miis' skill levels will increase, so that they can see exactly how much better they've become. People of all skill levels can pick up and play any of the games in the unprecedented Wii Sports package, making this truly a title for everyone!</desc>

		<name>Wwe'13</name>
		<desc>WWE  13 will run on the engine called, "Predator Technology 2.0," which succeeds the first version from WWE  12. The Predator Technology 2.0 game engine has been updated from the previous WWE games to allow for more fluid animations, with odd collisions and transitions having been fixed and updated, it also allows for over 300 new moves. Past problems have been fixed with a better weight detection system, contextual animations and automatic attack homing, to ensure that the character always strikes towards the enemy. The contextual animation system has been refined to ensure that it dynamically swaps out moves to make sure that the game is using the appropriate move animations at any given time and state. The weight detection system makes it so that small superstars such as Rey Mysterio are unable to lift larger wrestlers such as the Big Show. Thus, the contextual animations ensure that more appropriate attacks are put in the superstar s normal moveset. The game s new homing system is designed that when doing high flying moves, a player will hit the intended target with better precision. The homing system also tracks tables so that they will be better detected when doing grapples on a ladder in TLC and Ladder matches.[4]

The game is the first to feature Spectacular Moments, also known as "OMG! Moments." This feature allows players to bug the game to make it seem as ring breaks, barricade breaks, announce table breaks, and catching (mid-air) finishers are possible.[5] The Predator Technology engine has been further updated to include an enhanced audio engine, dubbed WWE Live. Instead of chanting pre-recorded in a warehouse as done in previous WWE games, WWE Live features chanting recorded from live WWE events. To make the audio more authentic, WWE Live features more crowd participation, with the crowd s chants, cheering and booing being dependent on the situation occurring in the match. Sounds were recorded by the WWE Production team and THQ from actual live events. Divas matches have also been updated, with up to six Divas, created and original, being able to compete simultaneously in the ring, a feature absent for many years. WWE  13 will also feature WWE Universe 3.0, which was also further updated to allow the player to edit schedules, television shows, rosters, as well as creating alliances or feuds between several wrestlers.

On September 21, it was confirmed that WWE  13 would contain the I Quit Match for the first time since WWF SmackDown! and the King of The Ring Tournament.[6]</desc>

		<desc>The Smackdown vs Raw series continues with the 2009 edition. This game features vast improvements on the tag team action, including all new Hot-Tag, tag team finishers and new actions to help in the match.

As with the previous game the roster includes over 60 superstars from Smackdown, Raw and ECW. To keep the roster up-to-date, the game includes a roster editor allowing players to change the rosters superstars are on and change their alignment between face and heel. However, this is the first game in the Smackdown series since "Here Comes the Pain" not to feature any legends.

Another new feature is Create-a-Finisher, which allows players to create their own unique finishing move out of over 500 different animations. These can also be shared online during online matches.

This game includes two different story modes, i.e. Road to Wrestlemania and Career mode. Road to Wrestlemania mode allows you to play 6 unique stories involving Triple H, CM Punk, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, John Cena and a co-op storyline featuring Batista and Rey Mysterio. Career mode is the replacement of GM Mode from previous games. This allows you to make a career for superstars and upgrade your created wrestlers.

Other features include the Highlight Reel, letting you create videos from your matches, the brand new Inferno Match, new positions in the backstage brawl and the new gauntlet match.</desc>

		<desc>WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 is a professional wrestling video game that is based on the two brands of WWE, Raw and SmackDown.

One of the main changes in the game is the incorporation of a new physics system that allows objects to be used more realistically, such as objects involved in the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Tables now break differently depending on the impact placed upon them. Inside and outside the ring, ladders can now be rested onto the ring ropes and be broken in half. For the first time since the original WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw game, chairs can be thrown at your opponents.</desc>

		<desc>Your Shape is a revolutionary new fitness product that is laser-focused on you, ensuring you get the most personalized, effective and fun workout possible. The Your Shape camera comes with the game and, using proprietary fitness tracking technology, scans you, giving you a full body shape analysis. The game combines that analysis with the results of your fitness test and your goals to create a personalized fitness program to help you meet your goals as efficiently and effectively as possible. Unlike any other fitness product, when you begin your workout, the camera projects your image onto the TV. Because the camera tracks your movements, your coach can give you real-time input on how you re doing and advice on how to do it better. And, you get all of these benefits without having to hold a controller as you workout, leaving your hands free to focus on the exercises. In fact, the game encourages you to incorporate your own exercise equipment (weights, balance ball, etc). Just tell it what you have at home, and your coach will add it to your personal workout. No other fitness product provides this level of personalization and interactivity while leaving your hands free.</desc>
