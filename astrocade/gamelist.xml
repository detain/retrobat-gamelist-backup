		<name>Artillery Duel</name>
		<desc>In this two player game each player controls an artillery gun set in a mountain landscape with the goal of destroying the other player. Players take turns firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</desc>

		<name>Bally Pin</name>
		<desc>Bally Pin is a pinball game featuring two different tables. The game is played with two joysticks, with one controlling the two left flippers and the other controlling the two to the right. The game can be played by up to four players who take turns until all player have used up all of their five balls. The aim is simply to get the highest score. The two tables are similar but with slightly different layouts and both feature six bumpers (lit or unlit), drop targets, upper kicker targets and a spinner. The ball is meant to react as a real ball would when struck by a flipper with the speed and angle of it being affected by where on the flipper it is hit.</desc>

		<name>Brickyard+clowns</name>
		<desc>This cartridge consists of two games: Brickyard and Clowns. Both games can be played by one to four players.

In Clowns you get points for popping balloons at the top of the screen. To reach them, you have to move a seesaw under a jumping clown. This will launch away the clown already standing on the seesaw, hopefully towards the balloons. 

Brickyard is a clone of Breakout. It is almost identical to the original game but differs in that the ball moves in a trajectory and not in a straight path. The game can be played in four different difficulties that alters the speed of the ball as well as the size of the paddle.</desc>

		<desc>Cosmic Raiders is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up similar to Defender. Like in that game the player's space ship can move both left and right and there is also a radar showing the locations of enemies. The game takes place in the alien sector Larkin and the player's objective is to defend a planet under attack while also collecting energy sources from an evil alien race called the Larkins. In every level four bombs are dropped along with a number of fighters to ensure the bombs reach the surface of the planet. The objective of the game is simply to clear all the enemies and get the highest score possible. For every two bombs destroyed an energy star that the player can collect will appear. By picking it up the player's ship is energized with an invincible energy shield. Once all enemies have been cleared from one level the game moves on to the next.

Before starting out it's possible to choose the number of players (1-4), number of lives (1-9) and the intensity of the game (0-9). Level 0 is the easiest one and the only one where enemies do not get harder as the game goes on. Each player can have a different intensity level.</desc>

		<desc>Cosmic Raiders is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up similar to Defender. Like in that game the player's space ship can move both left and right and there is also a radar showing the locations of enemies. The game takes place in the alien sector Larkin and the player's objective is to defend a planet under attack while also collecting energy sources from an evil alien race called the Larkins. In every level four bombs are dropped along with a number of fighters to ensure the bombs reach the surface of the planet. The objective of the game is simply to clear all the enemies and get the highest score possible. For every two bombs destroyed an energy star that the player can collect will appear. By picking it up the player's ship is energized with an invincible energy shield. Once all enemies have been cleared from one level the game moves on to the next.

Before starting out it's possible to choose the number of players (1-4), number of lives (1-9) and the intensity of the game (0-9). Level 0 is the easiest one and the only one where enemies do not get harder as the game goes on. Each player can have a different intensity level.</desc>

		<name>Galactic Invasion</name>
		<desc>Galactic Invasion is a port of the Namco arcade game Galaxian for the Bally Astrocade.
Alien ships come at your missile launcher from every direction. They peel off from their formation singly or in groups of twos or threes. The more aliens you destroy, the more of their reinforcements attack. Each ship is piloted by a highly skilled captain capable of maneuvering with incredible agility. Realistic sounds add to the intensity. Up to 4 players.
Aim your missiles at the alien ships and score points for each one you hit! The colorful invaders spin around and soar across the screen in an attempt to destroy your base.
Excitement builds as they collide into (or bomb) one after another of your bases. Exploding several of their ships will make the aliens angry â€” they'll attack you with greater speed and force than ever before.</desc>

		<name>Grand Prix + Demolition Derby</name>
		<desc>Grand Prix is a formula racing game played from a top down perspective. There are three different tracks that are all one screen in size. The controls simply involve accelerating and steering left and right with the aim of reaching the finish line first. The number of laps (1-99) and the difficulty level (pro or beginner) can be selected before a race. Pro differs in the speed of the cars.

Demolition Derby is similar to Grand Prix but here the objective is to ram into the other cars until only one remains in the arena. Each car has a number of points (which is chosen by the players) and for each hit one point is lost. When a car reaches zero points it loses and cannot move any further.</desc>

		<name>The Incredible Wizard</name>
		<desc>Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a top-down point of view.
The Bally Astrocade release of the game was titled The Incredible Wizard. It had the game ref number 2017 as a suffix.

The player controls a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures which wander about the maze like corridors. The creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at the player, and some even have the ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.

When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys the creature before it escapes, the next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points.

The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points.

The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<desc>The game's release date is 1982 on the game box and 1981 on the cartridge.

Solar Conqueror is a top-down viewed shoot 'em up with multidirectional shooting and movement similar to Asteroids or Robotron. The war hungry DEMENS are threatening to wipe out the player's race with a radiation death ray and therefore the player has to conquer their solar systems.

Each solar system consists of two or four planets and to conquer them all planets have to be defeated. In each screen a planet is located to the far right of the screen and from it various alien defenders will appear. To defeat the planet and move on to the next one the player has to kill all the enemies while avoiding getting hit by them. There are three different enemies: kamikaze combat ships, ground-to-air missiles and super fighting (killer) satellites. There are also asteroids floating around the planets that has to be avoided. Larger planets have stronger gravity which leads to the spaceship being harder control. The effect of the gravity increases as the ship gets closer to the planet.

The game can be played by up to four players. Before starting out it's possible to choose how many lives each player should have and at what levels they should start on, thereby handicapping more skilled players. Any contact with an enemy, a projectile or a planet leads to a lost life but a new one is given for each solar system conquered.</desc>

This is a fixed screen shoot 'em up where the player is in control of a stationary laser base which is located in the middle of the screen. Alien space ships will appear from the four sides of the screen and launch space mines towards the laser base. The player's task is simply to shoot them down before they reach and destroy the laser base.

The game is controlled with five buttons: one for shooting and four for aiming, one for each direction. In addition to the mines and alien ships there are also attack satellites that orbit the laser base before attacking. The mines are worth 250 points, alien ships are worth 500 points and attack satellites are worth 2,000 points. The player starts out with three lives but earns a new one at 75,000, 150,000 and 300,000 points.</desc>

		<desc>Star Battle is a space shooter based on the trench run sequence from the original Star Wars movie. The game is for one or two players and involves a battle between an X-Wing and a Tie Fighter, although since it doesn't carry a license they are not called that. The X-Wing is controlled by player one while the Tie Fighter is controlled by player two or the computer. Before starting out a maximum score (1-999) is entered and the player that first reaches it wins the game. A single hit is enough to bring down the enemy ship and it is worth one point.

The game is viewed from a third-person perspective with a pseudo 3D representation of the trench. The colour of the trench changes constantly to illustrate the forward motion of the fighters. By moving the joystick up or down the fighters accelerate or decelerate which means they move to the top of the screen and decreases in size or move to the bottom and get larger. If one moves closer to the camera the other gets further away and vice versa.</desc>

MLM does simplify the entry of hex code (which otherwise must be entered using decimal via BASIC. Also the keypad layout does not require the use of the key-shifts, so typing is faster). Programs can be saved via the Bally BASIC 300-baud.</desc>

Players take turns firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game.

		<desc>Bally Pin is a pinball game featuring two different tables. The game is played with two joysticks, with one controlling the two left flippers and the other controlling the two to the right. The game can be played by up to four players who take turns until all player have used up all of their five balls. The aim is simply to get the highest score. The two tables are similar but with slightly different layouts and both feature six bumpers (lit or unlit), drop targets, upper kicker targets and a spinner. The ball is meant to react as a real ball would when struck by a flipper with the speed and angle of it being affected by where on the flipper it is hit.</desc>

		<desc>This cartridge consists of two games: Brickyard and Clowns. Both games can be played by one to four players.

In Clowns you get points for popping balloons at the top of the screen. To reach them, you have to move a seesaw under a jumping clown. This will launch away the clown already standing on the seesaw, hopefully towards the balloons. 

Brickyard is a clone of Breakout. It is almost identical to the original game but differs in that the ball moves in a trajectory and not in a straight path. The game can be played in four different difficulties that alters the speed of the ball as well as the size of the paddle.</desc>

		<desc>Cosmic Raiders is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up similar to Defender. Like in that game the player's space ship can move both left and right and there is also a radar showing the locations of enemies. The game takes place in the alien sector Larkin and the player's objective is to defend a planet under attack while also collecting energy sources from an evil alien race called the Larkins. In every level four bombs are dropped along with a number of fighters to ensure the bombs reach the surface of the planet. The objective of the game is simply to clear all the enemies and get the highest score possible. For every two bombs destroyed an energy star that the player can collect will appear. By picking it up the player's ship is energized with an invincible energy shield. Once all enemies have been cleared from one level the game moves on to the next.

Before starting out it's possible to choose the number of players (1-4), number of lives (1-9) and the intensity of the game (0-9). Level 0 is the easiest one and the only one where enemies do not get harder as the game goes on. Each player can have a different intensity level.</desc>

		<desc>Galactic Invasion is a port of the Namco arcade game Galaxian for the Bally Astrocade.
Alien ships come at your missile launcher from every direction. They peel off from their formation singly or in groups of twos or threes. The more aliens you destroy, the more of their reinforcements attack. Each ship is piloted by a highly skilled captain capable of maneuvering with incredible agility. Realistic sounds add to the intensity. Up to 4 players.
Aim your missiles at the alien ships and score points for each one you hit! The colorful invaders spin around and soar across the screen in an attempt to destroy your base.
Excitement builds as they collide into (or bomb) one after another of your bases. Exploding several of their ships will make the aliens angry â€” they'll attack you with greater speed and force than ever before.</desc>

		<name>Grand Prix + Demolition Derby</name>
		<desc>Grand Prix is a formula racing game played from a top down perspective. There are three different tracks that are all one screen in size. The controls simply involve accelerating and steering left and right with the aim of reaching the finish line first. The number of laps (1-99) and the difficulty level (pro or beginner) can be selected before a race. Pro differs in the speed of the cars.

Demolition Derby is similar to Grand Prix but here the objective is to ram into the other cars until only one remains in the arena. Each car has a number of points (which is chosen by the players) and for each hit one point is lost. When a car reaches zero points it loses and cannot move any further.</desc>

Like in the arcade game the player's task is to protect a number of cities on the ground but here the attack does not come from missiles. Instead there are enemy ships that enter the screen one at a time and drop bombs on the cities. The player has access to three outposts on the ground that are fired individually and are used to shoot down the ships as well as their bombs. Each outpost has limited ammo and when it has run out no further shooting can be done from it. Points are scored for hitting bombs and ships and for completing levels and at 10,000 points an extra city is given. The game ends when all cities have been destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a top-down point of view.
The Bally Astrocade release of the game was titled The Incredible Wizard. It had the game ref number 2017 as a suffix.

The player controls a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures which wander about the maze like corridors. The creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at the player, and some even have the ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.

When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys the creature before it escapes, the next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points.

The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

The player controls a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures which wander about the maze like corridors. The creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at the player, and some even have the ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.

When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys the creature before it escapes, the next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points.

The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<name>Solar Conqueror</name>
		<desc>The game's release date is 1982 on the game box and 1981 on the cartridge.

Solar Conqueror is a top-down viewed shoot 'em up with multidirectional shooting and movement similar to Asteroids or Robotron. The war hungry DEMENS are threatening to wipe out the player's race with a radiation death ray and therefore the player has to conquer their solar systems.

Each solar system consists of two or four planets and to conquer them all planets have to be defeated. In each screen a planet is located to the far right of the screen and from it various alien defenders will appear. To defeat the planet and move on to the next one the player has to kill all the enemies while avoiding getting hit by them. There are three different enemies: kamikaze combat ships, ground-to-air missiles and super fighting (killer) satellites. There are also asteroids floating around the planets that has to be avoided. Larger planets have stronger gravity which leads to the spaceship being harder control. The effect of the gravity increases as the ship gets closer to the planet.

The game can be played by up to four players. Before starting out it's possible to choose how many lives each player should have and at what levels they should start on, thereby handicapping more skilled players. Any contact with an enemy, a projectile or a planet leads to a lost life but a new one is given for each solar system conquered.</desc>

		<desc>Released on the Arcades as Space Zap and for the Bally Astrocade as Space Fortress.

This is a fixed screen shoot 'em up where the player is in control of a stationary laser base which is located in the middle of the screen. Alien space ships will appear from the four sides of the screen and launch space mines towards the laser base. The player's task is simply to shoot them down before they reach and destroy the laser base.

The game is controlled with five buttons: one for shooting and four for aiming, one for each direction. In addition to the mines and alien ships there are also attack satellites that orbit the laser base before attacking. The mines are worth 250 points, alien ships are worth 500 points and attack satellites are worth 2,000 points. The player starts out with three lives but earns a new one at 75,000, 150,000 and 300,000 points.</desc>

		<desc>Star Battle is a space shooter based on the trench run sequence from the original Star Wars movie. The game is for one or two players and involves a battle between an X-Wing and a Tie Fighter, although since it doesn't carry a license they are not called that. The X-Wing is controlled by player one while the Tie Fighter is controlled by player two or the computer. Before starting out a maximum score (1-999) is entered and the player that first reaches it wins the game. A single hit is enough to bring down the enemy ship and it is worth one point.

The game is viewed from a third-person perspective with a pseudo 3D representation of the trench. The colour of the trench changes constantly to illustrate the forward motion of the fighters. By moving the joystick up or down the fighters accelerate or decelerate which means they move to the top of the screen and decreases in size or move to the bottom and get larger. If one moves closer to the camera the other gets further away and vice versa.</desc>

		<name>Treasure Cove</name>
		<desc>Treasure Cove is an action game that takes place off a small island in the Caribbean where the player has to dive into the ocean and search for the treasure of a lost Spanish galleon. The action takes place on a single screen and the player starts out in a small boat at the top of the screen. At the bottom there are several pieces of treasure that has to be retrieved (one at a time) but the ocean is also full of fishes and other sea creatures that have to be avoided. Any contact with these (including the smallest of fishes) will lead to an immediate loss of life. A life is also lost if the player runs out of oxygen which means it's necessary to plan ahead since it's not possible to go back to the boat (and recharge the oxygen) empty handed. With the press of a button the player can move quicker but at a higher cost of oxygen. After clearing all treasure from the cove the game will move on to a new location with more valuable treasure but also with more fishes.

The game can be played by one to four players in hot seat. Before starting out the number of lives for each player can be chosen from one to nine. There is also a tournament level mode where each player has four divers. This mode was meant for players who wanted to mail their high score to the developer for high score verification.</desc>
