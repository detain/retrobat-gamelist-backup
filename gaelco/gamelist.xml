Smashing Drive (c) 2000 Gaelco.

An arcade game based on the frantic driving of a 'super-cab' in New York. You are an experienced taxi driver, racing through the city with a "super-cab" and dealing with the infernal traffic on a race to race basis. In your route, you will pick up some picturesque passengers, from the absent-minded tourist with his camera, to a dangerous Mafia's boss with his bodyguard. You have to take them to destination in the least possible time.

During your journey across this chaotic city, you will come across different icons, if you pass them through, they will transform your taxi into a fantastic car during a short period of time, these icons will offer you advantages over the rest of vehicles and obstacles that you will find along your path.

'Smashing Drive' offers you the possibility of choosing between three different circuits, with progressive difficulty, where you will be able to compete against another player, if the machine is linked, or against the CPU.
