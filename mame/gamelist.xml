- TRIVIA -

The FZ-1 3DO model was released on:
- October 04, 1993 in North America, Initially priced $699.99.
- March 20, 1994 in Japan.

R.E.A.L 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (often referred to as 3DO) is a set of technical specifications created by The 3DO Company. The 3DO Company was the result of a partnership between Matsushita, AT&amp;T, Time Warner, MCA, Electronic Arts, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (a venture capital firm) and the New Technologies Group (NTG). None of these companies ever manufactured a single console. Other manufacturing companies (in the end only Panasonic, Goldstar and Sanyo) could license the rights to create their own console and label them as 3DO, by simply fulfilling the required specifications.

The system was conceived by Trip Hawkins, the man who created Electronic Arts in 1982, and its technologies were originally designed by Dave Needle and Robert J. Mical of New Technology Group, which already designed the Atari Lynx.

Technically, a 3DO system can run 3DO Interactive software, play audio CD's (including support for CD+G), view Photo-CDs and even play Video CD's by using a special add-on MPEG1 FMV cartridge (this cartridge was only available for the American Goldstar and Japanese Panasonic 3DO systems).

Despite a highly-promoted launch and its advanced technology, 3DO never met the expected success. The main reason for this has probably to be sought in the system's high price, not balanced by high quality titles, neither at launch nor immediately after. For sure, few titles exploited the full potential of the console, and the most well-received titles were often ports of games from other systems. This prevented any real 3DO penetration in the console market.

3DO Company's official position about the price was that 3DO was a high-end audio-visual system rather than a simple videogame console, so the price was fair. Only in 1996 they announced a price drop, probably to help the diffusion and popularity before the launch of the promised next-gen console M2, but it was definitely too late.

The 3DO system was eventually discontinued at the end of 1996 with a complete shutdown of all internal hardware development and divestment of the M2 technology. 3DO restructured themselves around this same time, becoming a multi-platform software company until its bankrupt in 2003.

50 Lions was released in October 2002. It was the first of the 50 line games.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

All pays are left to right including scatters.

Diamond appears on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 and substitutes for all symbols except scatters.

Feature: Spin up 3 scattered Proteas to trigger the feature. An additional 5 free games can be won once during the feature, giving the player a maximum of 15 free games. If the Proteas are spun up more than once in the free games, only the scatter win is paid.

During the free games, one wild Diamond is progressively added to reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the remaining games. Additional Diamonds are placed underneath one another, forming a row of wild Diamonds in each reel. The player can have as many as sixteen Diamonds on the screen from as early as the third free game.

		<name>10-Yard Fight</name>
		<desc>The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to a running back, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.
10-Yard Fight has five levels of difficulty; from easiest to most difficult: high school, college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl. If the player wins both halves of an "accelerated real time" 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advanced to the next level of difficulty, like a career mode.</desc>

		<desc>The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to a running back, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.
10-Yard Fight has five levels of difficulty; from easiest to most difficult: high school, college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl. If the player wins both halves of an "accelerated real time" 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advanced to the next level of difficulty, like a career mode.</desc>

15 lions (c) 2004 Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty, Ltd.

- TRIVIA -

This game is an adaptation of "50 Lions" to a standard 5 reel, 3 symbol per reel layout. Unlike 50 Lions which has 50 different paylines, this game has 25 paylines. The gameplay is identical to "Sun Queen" and "Love Stuck". 

The game's name is a reference to the maximum number of lions which could fill the screen if the reels lined up.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

All pays are left to right including scatters.

Diamond appears on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 and substitutes for all symbols except scatters.

Feature: Spin up 3 scattered Proteas to trigger the feature. An additional 5 free games can be won once during the feature, giving the player a maximum of 15 free games. If the Proteas are spun up more than once in the free games, only the scatter win is paid.

During the free games, one wild Diamond is progressively added to reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the remaining games. Additional Diamonds are placed underneath one another, forming a row of wild Diamonds in each reel. The player can have as many as twelve Diamonds on the screen from as early as the third free game.

Player presses START button, shifts into 1st, 'hits the hammer' and the 18 WHEELER is on its way. The object is to keep the truck on the road, pick up cargo and make time. A shift into 2nd and 3rd gear, at appropriate MPH, creates faster action, more speed ans greater score. The game requires agility and coordination. Just about every limb is in motion. The left hand steers the authentic BIG WHEEL, the right hand operates the genuine GEAR SHIFT, the right foot works THE HAMMER accelerator and the AIR BRAKE stop.</desc>

		<desc>A truck driving game from Sega. Race another trucker across the country, carrying cargo and trying to beat the clock. The main purpose is to make it to the finish line with your cargo within a given time. Players choose one of several trucks, each rated in speed, handling, etc. They then race from point to point across the country, hauling cargo (more difficult cargo will increase your pay for that leg of the journey) while avoiding innocent traffic (blare the horn to get drivers out of your way) and trying to outrun a reckless computer opponent (or player two in linked matches). Good performances are rewarded with bonus stages that require players to maneuver the truck in tight alleyways and park the truck in a limited amount of time.</desc>

		<desc>"1942" is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Pacific theatre during World War II, in which the goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet. 

The player pilots a plane dubbed the "Super Ace" (its appearance is that of a Lockheed P-38 Lightning) and has to shoot down waves of enemy planes while avoiding incoming enemy fire. The 'Super Ace' can perform a limited number of rolls or 'loop-the-loops' to evade enemy planes and shots. 

During the game, waves of red enemy planes periodically appear. If the player manages to destroy a red wave, a power-up, in the form of a 'POW' symbol, will be dropped and can be picked up. The power-up will award either increased fire-power (doubling the player's guns from two to four), a smart bomb that destroys all on-screen enemy planes the instant it's collected, two wingmen planes that flank the Super Ace and increase fire power, or simply extra points.

At the end of each stage the 'Super Ace' lands on an aircraft carrier and bonus points are awarded based on player performance. "1942" differs from other games in that its levels are numbered in reverse order, so the game begins at stage 32 and ends at stage 1.</desc>

		<desc>The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese Air Fleet that bombed the players' American Aircraft Carrier, pursue all Japanese Air and Sea forces, fly through the 16 levels of play, make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 Levels consist of an Air-to-Sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as an End-Level Boss), while 5 levels consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese Bombers and a Mother Bomber that needs to be destroyed.
As in 1942, players pilot a P-38. Two buttons are used: one for regular attacks (with several weapons) and one for special actions that executes either a loop like in 1942 or one of three special attacks that damage the plane. Unlike 1942, the player only has one life, with one refillable energy meter. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a temporary special weapons which replaces the default twin gun.</desc>

		<name>1943: The Battle of Midway</name>
		<desc>The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese Air Fleet that bombed the players' American Aircraft Carrier, pursue all Japanese Air and Sea forces, fly through the 16 levels of play, make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 Levels consist of an Air-to-Sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as an End-Level Boss), while 5 levels consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese Bombers and a Mother Bomber that needs to be destroyed.
As in 1942, players pilot a P-38. Two buttons are used: one for regular attacks (with several weapons) and one for special actions that executes either a loop like in 1942 or one of three special attacks that damage the plane. Unlike 1942, the player only has one life, with one refillable energy meter. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a temporary special weapons which replaces the default twin gun.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.

However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.

In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.</desc>

2. a Sniper House that opens to reveal a bullet-spraying terrorist;
3. an exploding Safe House that one can shoot the pinball into;
4. several single Sniper Drop Targets that can both obscure and free up playfield shots;
5. and lots of multi-ball action

- TECHNICAL -

H: 75 1/2 inches.
W: 27 inches.

Weight: 250lbs.

- TRIVIA -

24 (1.0) was Released in February 2009. This pinball table is based on the Fox television show of the same name starring Kiefer Sutherland.

- UPDATES -

* 1.50 (May 5, 2010)
- The left ramp and the sniper post were holding onto the ball for too long (in some cases). This has been corrected.
- Ball search was allowed to run when the ball was being held on the left ramp for choreography. This has been corrected.
- Fixed operating system bug that would cause the music volume to spike up to a high level and remain there until the game was power cycled.

* 1.44 (September 2, 2009)
- Fixed a problem with persistent style auditing that could cause the game to stop running in 50HZ countries.
- Roughed in a rule for 'Escape'.
- Added lamp effects and display effects.
- Roughed in 'Save the President' and 'Master Agent' modes.
- Fixed a problem with the game over "music".  If a high score was earned and the match effect did not run at game-over (via tournament, or by the match feature being 'off'), then the high score to date music would run until a new game was started, or until the game was power-cycled. This has been corrected.
- Fixed a problem with the NUKE jackpot. The score was being initialized at power-up and then only increased. This would eventually result in massive NUKE jackpot scores if the game was never powered off. This has been corrected.
- Added a game name message for the Beta-Brite sign.
- Extra ball and Special were not scoring points when the corresponding awards could not be given out. This has been corrected.
- Roughed in skill shot.
- Multiballs were not being restarted when add-a-ball was awarded during various multiball grace periods. This has been corrected.
- Fixed credit display when inserting a coin (the screen would pause for two seconds and show blank scores).
- Added 'ABORT ANIMATIONS' adjustment, and implementation thereof.
- Added shaker motor code.
- Some background lamp effects that used the flashlamps were not being killed at the start of bonus. This has been corrected.

* 1.40 (March 9, 2009)
- Terrorist speech is now louder
- The wizard mode requirement for 'safe house jackpot' was being awarded in the wrong place, this has been corrected.
- Added more lamp effects, display effects, and sounds.

* 1.30 (March 4, 2009)
- suitcase stepper now goes to correct position at power up and during test mode.
- sentox nerve gas award scene is now longer with additional art images
- cell phone now gives mystery style awards
- corrected the audit for terrorist multiball super jackpot lit.
- added art image to sniper multiball total screen
- added more display/lamps/sounds for sniper multiball, terrorist multiball, and suitcase multiball total effects.
- added more art and sound for safe house multiball start, super jackpot.
- added/fixed damn it speech
- added more Jack speech
- different art for pops grow
- Added artwork for sniper target hit. Added music and speech volume adjustments for France. Sniper coil shuts down when entering test mode. More lamp, speech, display f/x for sniper and terrorist.

* 1.20 (February 27, 2009)
- Added French &amp; Italian text
- Disarm nuke now has more graphics/speech
- Some Chloe speech is now shorter

* 1.10 (February 24, 2009)
- added an adjustment for disabling the suitcase. Drop target test now always fires the drop targets, whether they are up or down. Added art and sounds for the start of terrorist hurry-up. 1 terrorist is now being awarded for hitting a safe house standup target.

The 24 pinball machine playfield features:
1. a Suitcase that holds and releases pinballs for multi-ball play;
2. a Sniper House that opens to reveal a bullet-spraying terrorist;
3. an exploding Safe House that one can shoot the pinball into;
4. several single Sniper Drop Targets that can both obscure and free up playfield shots;
5. and lots of multi-ball action

- TRIVIA -

24 (1.0) was Released in February 2009. This pinball table is based on the Fox television show of the same name starring Kiefer Sutherland.

The 24 pinball contains original speech by Mary Lynn Rajskub, who plays Chloe on the television show. The pinball also offers speech from the television show, as spoken by Jack (Kiefer Sutherland) and Chloe.

- UPDATES -

* 1.50 (May 5, 2010)
- The left ramp and the sniper post were holding onto the ball for too long (in some cases). This has been corrected.
- Ball search was allowed to run when the ball was being held on the left ramp for choreography. This has been corrected.
- Fixed operating system bug that would cause the music volume to spike up to a high level and remain there until the game was power cycled.

* 1.44 (September 2, 2009)
- Fixed a problem with persistent style auditing that could cause the game to stop running in 50HZ countries.
- Roughed in a rule for 'Escape'.
- Added lamp effects and display effects.
- Roughed in 'Save the President' and 'Master Agent' modes.
- Fixed a problem with the game over "music".  If a high score was earned and the match effect did not run at game-over (via tournament, or by the match feature being 'off'), then the high score to date music would run until a new game was started, or until the game was power-cycled. This has been corrected.
- Fixed a problem with the NUKE jackpot. The score was being initialized at power-up and then only increased. This would eventually result in massive NUKE jackpot scores if the game was never powered off. This has been corrected.
- Added a game name message for the Beta-Brite sign.
- Extra ball and Special were not scoring points when the corresponding awards could not be given out. This has been corrected.
- Roughed in skill shot.
- Multiballs were not being restarted when add-a-ball was awarded during various multiball grace periods. This has been corrected.
- Fixed credit display when inserting a coin (the screen would pause for two seconds and show blank scores).
- Added 'ABORT ANIMATIONS' adjustment, and implementation thereof.
- Added shaker motor code.
- Some background lamp effects that used the flashlamps were not being killed at the start of bonus. This has been corrected.

* 1.40 (March 9, 2009)
- Terrorist speech is now louder
- The wizard mode requirement for 'safe house jackpot' was being awarded in the wrong place, this has been corrected.
- Added more lamp effects, display effects, and sounds.

* 1.30 (March 4, 2009)
- suitcase stepper now goes to correct position at power up and during test mode.
- sentox nerve gas award scene is now longer with additional art images
- cell phone now gives mystery style awards
- corrected the audit for terrorist multiball super jackpot lit.
- added art image to sniper multiball total screen

- added/fixed damn it speech
- added more Jack speech
- different art for pops grow
- Added artwork for sniper target hit. Added music and speech volume adjustments for France. Sniper coil shuts down when entering test mode. More lamp, speech, display f/x for sniper and terrorist.

* 1.20 (February 27, 2009)
- Added French &amp; Italian text
- Disarm nuke now has more graphics/speech
- Some Chloe speech is now shorter

* 1.10 (February 24, 2009)
- added an adjustment for disabling the suitcase. Drop target test now always fires the drop targets, whether they are up or down. Added art and sounds for the start of terrorist hurry-up. 1 terrorist is now being awarded for hitting a safe house standup target.

Sega Genesis 32X (c) 1994 Sega of America, Inc.

The Sega Genesis 32X is an add-on for the Sega Genesis video game console. Codenamed 'Project Mars', the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the 32-bit era until the later release of the Sega Saturn. Independent of the Genesis, the 32X utilizes its own ROM cartridges and has its own library of games.

- TECHNICAL -

Model No. MK-84000A

CPU: 2 x SH-2 32-bit RISC (23 MHz)
Memory: 2Mbit RAM
Display: 320 x 240 resolution, 32768 on-screen colors.
Dimensions: 110 x 210 x 100 mm (4.3 x 8.3 x 3.9 in).
Weight: 495 g. (17.5 oz)

- TRIVIA -

Unveiled at June 1994's Consumer Electronics Show, Sega presented the 32X as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games. Developed in response to the Atari Jaguar and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994, the product was originally conceived as an entirely new console. At the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful. The final design contained two 32-bit central processing unit chips and a 3-D graphics processor. In order to bring the new add-on to market by its scheduled release date of November 21, 1994, development of the new system and its games were rushed.

Ultimately, the console failed to attract third-party video game developers and sufficient consumers due to the announcement of the Sega Saturn's simultaneous release in Japan. Sega's efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into available time for game development, resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully utilize the add-on's hardware, including Genesis ports. By the end of 1994, the 32X had sold 665,000 units. After price reductions in 1995, it was officially discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned their focus toward the Saturn.

		<desc>3 Count Bout is a one-on-one fighting game. Choose from ten wrestlers who have their own power attacks. There are ten rounds in the game, and each one of them has you fighting other wrestlers that are much tougher than the previous ones. You defeat each one by biting, kicking, and performing other moves to the point where their damage meter is empty. But just because it is empty doesn't mean that you win. You have to pin him for the infamous-three count. Also features competitive play and tag match battles.</desc>

		<name>Sankokushi</name>
		<desc>Sankokushi is an adult Shanghai solitaire game. Unlike in a standard mahjong solitaire game, tiles are removed in groups of three.  These groups may be made up of three matching tiles, or the number sets, 1-3, 4-6, or 7-9. The objective is to find the four, three-tile sets shown at the start of the stage and remove them from the game board before the timer runs out.

When a tile is selected, other tiles are lit up.  Tiles within the number sequence are shown in pink, and matching tiles are shown in orange.  The player may request hints by selecting the help button on screen, which will light up all tiles that can be removed from the board at that time.  There is also a back button, which the player may select to return tiles to the screen.

The background image in each stage is an image of a girl.  Each girl has two background images, with the second image showing the girl topless. Once a player removes the four tile sets for the stage, the board is cleared and the player may see the entire image.

After completing a stage the player may use the points he has earned to buy power-ups, such as extra hints or a faster cursor.

The game is over once the timer has run out or if the player cannot legally remove any more tiles and the board is 'deadlocked'.  Upon continuing the player may select to play the same board or play a different one.</desc>

In all rooms, the Stooges need to destroy the furniture and find the 3 hidden keys that unlock the exit. Using their hammers, Moe, Larry &amp; Curly bang away!
Interfering socialites and cops are dealt with in typical Stooges style: a face slap, a hammer to the noggin, or the ever-dependable cream pie.
Bonus round: Avoid the sour notes of the opera singer as you collect the three keys to the exit. And watch out for the cops, too!
In the Mad Scientist's laboratory, the Stooges rescue Cora, the first fiancee. That leaves Nora and Dora still in danger! Let the game continue!

DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS SUMMER'S HIT VIDEO!

Let Larry, Moe and Curly bring their hilarity and popularity to your game locations! Every player will want to be his favourite Stooge! Three Players at one time can mean greater profitability too!

		<name>4-D Warriors</name>
		<desc>4-D Warriors is a strange deep space shoot them up, which apparently has a 4th dimension. The game is a side scrolling shooter in which you take control of a jetpack propelled space warrior who travels between parallel universes and worm holes throughout the game. By flying over the top of the play field, you end up in an alternate universe. You travel back and forth defeating enemies until you reach a boss creature. On some occasions a worm hole will appear in the middle of the play field and you are taken to even stranger worlds...</desc>

		<name>Mahjong 4p Simasyo</name>
		<desc>An adult, mahjong game, Mahjong 4P Simasyo features images of live action AV actresses and one actor representing the player. Game play starts with a four player match against three CPU controlled girls. Once the player wins this match he is rewarded with a still shot of a topless model in all of her pixelated glory.
The player then selects one of the three girls from the previous match for a one-on-one game. The player then plays against that girl until he defeats her three times or he wins all of her money. Once defeated the girl is shown nude in a low frame-rate "video" of her body bouncing up and down in a suggestive fashion.
After this the player again competes in a 4-player round against the same girls until all three have been defeated in one-on-one matches. Game play then continues with a new set of three girls.</desc>

Make room for the ultimate, hi-tech linkable motorcycle racing video game available. 500GP is the real thing. Race against real Grand Prix riders. Race on real Grand Prix courses.

So real you have to fight the wind.

		<name>720°</name>
		<desc>A one or two-player arcade game with players taking on the role of a skateboarder, and must perform various tricks and maneuvers to earn the points and tickets needed to compete for medals in the game's numerous skate parks. 

The bulk of the action takes place in a 'Skate City', a small urban area made up of ramps, jumps and hazards. Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes. 

Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds. 

The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded. 

Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start. 

At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game. 

The main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. There are numerous city hazards to be avoided, such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers and other skaters. To guide the player around Skate City are map tiles. Riding over one of these will temporaily pause the action and display the layout of the city, including the locations of the skate parks and equipment stalls.</desc>

		<desc>A one or two-player arcade game with players taking on the role of a skateboarder, and must perform various tricks and maneuvers to earn the points and tickets needed to compete for medals in the game's numerous skate parks. 

The bulk of the action takes place in a 'Skate City', a small urban area made up of ramps, jumps and hazards. Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes. 

Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds. 

The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded. 

Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start. 

At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game.

		<desc>7 Ordi is a seven card stud medal game. Once the player meets the minimum number of credits the player is dealt a hand. Three cards are dealt to the player and the computer and one card is chosen to show face up.  Next a card is dealt and a round of betting takes place. Two more cards are dealt face up with a round of betting after each. Then one more card is dealt face down with one more round of betting.

If the player wins then the player may choose to either take his winnings or play a mini-game where he bets on whether the next card will be a low card (1-5), a high card (6-10), or a face card (J,Q,K). After every winning guess the player may choose to continue or drop out.

Hands are dealt until the players credits fall below the minimum level to play.</desc>

		<desc>Konami '88 (also known as '88 Games or Hyper Sports Special) is the third in the Track &amp; Field game series by Konami, where you test your Olympic skills against other world-class athletes. As the name implies, it is loosely based on (and not licensed by) the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Bronze or silver medals are not good enough - you have to go for the gold to get to the next event. However, you must at least qualify in each event in order to compete in the next event.</desc>

8-BALL ACTION

It's priced right to give you phenomenal return on investment. It's a simple conversion that enables you to convert quickly and easily those old Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr. games

Birdie King: $2500
8-Ball Action: Under $400

If you don't believe this game will take the same action as Birdie King, ask your distributor to prove it to you.

We will make them earn for you today!

PROOF:
Atlas Music Company of Providence tested two games of 8-Ball Action. They now have 25 on location. Louie, the buyer at Atlas made the following comment: Doing Great! Game play Realistic. Will even play against regular poll tables. Has possibility of longevity compared to most videos. Can't believe the price!</desc>

		<desc>Repulse is a fixed shooter arcade game, developed by Crux and published by Sega in 1985.[1] It was renamed 99: The Last War when licensed to Kyugo (who developed the hardware) and Proma. There's also a bootleg version named Son of Phoenix.
With a spaceship, the player shoots several kinds of robotic enemies and spaceships. At the end of every stage (except for the first one), the player meets a huge enemy spaceship as the stage's boss. Player's spaceship is equipped with a limited force shield which allows it to resist any kind of attack, though energy drains both while its active and whenever the ship gets hit during. Power-ups are dropped by ally helicopters and spaceships, that bring to the player a new shot (much faster than the normal one) and refills his force field's meter.</desc>

Amiga 1000 (c) 1985 Commodore, Limited.

- TRIVIA -

The Commodore Amiga 1000 was the first in the Amiga line of personal computers released by Commodore International. Before the release of the Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 models in 1987, the A1000 was simply called Amiga.

Introduced on July 23, 1985 at the Lincoln Center in New York City, machines began shipping in September with a base configuration of 256 kB of RAM at the retail price of US$1,295. A 13-inch (330 mm) analog RGB monitor was available for around US$300, bringing the price of a complete Amiga system to 1,595 USD.

In the US, the A1000 was marketed as The Amiga from Commodore, though the Commodore logo was omitted from the case. Additionally, the Amiga 1000 was sold exclusively in computer stores rather than the various non computer-dedicated department and toy stores through which the VIC20 and Commodore 64 were retailed. These measures were an effort to avoid Commodore's toy-store computer image created during the Tramiel era.



The conceptor of the Amiga 1000 was Jay Miner, who created the Atari 800 many years before. He wanted to make the most powerful computer ever, then he joined a little California company called Amiga. He used the principle of the three coprocessors (again) to help the main processor. At the beginning, the Amiga had only 64 kilobytes of RAM!, Atari wanted to buy the Amiga but finally, Commodore succeeded to buy it (then there was a lawsuit, which Commodore won). It was meant to be a competitor to the Atari 520 ST.

The operating system was done by Metacomco, a British company who specialized in the 68000 processor (they also made languages for the Sinclair QL). It is a fully multitasking system which looks like UNIX with a graphical user interface. It was the very first personal computer with great graphics and sound capabilities with a GUI environment. Along with the operating system, the machine came bundled with a version of AmigaBASIC developed by Microsoft and a speech synthesis library developed by Softvoice, Inc.

The Amiga 1000 began to lose popularity one year later with the creation of its two main successors: the Amiga 500 and the Amiga 2000.

Atari 1200XL (c) 1982 Atari, Incorporated.

Atari 8-bit computer.

- TECHNICAL -

WHAT's NEW:
- New aluminum and smoked plastic cases
- 64 KB of RAM
- Only two joystick ports
- Help key
- Four function keys.

- TRIVIA -

Released in late 1982, the Atari 1200XL was an odd hybrid of features from the Sweet 8/16 projects. Notable features were 64 KB of RAM, built-in self test, redesigned keyboard, and redesigned cable port layout. In general terms the 1200XL most closely matched the high end Sweet 16 concept.
However the 1200XL also included a number of missing or poorly implemented features. The PBI expansion connector from the original 1000X design was left off, making the design rely entirely on SIO again. Frustrating this was the fact that the +12V pin in the SIO port was left unconnected; only +5V power was available although some devices made use of the +12V line. An improved video circuit provided more chroma for a more colorful image, but the chroma line was not connected to the monitor port, the only place that could make use of it. Even the re-arrangement of the ports made some joysticks and cartridges difficult or impossible to use. Changes made to the operating system to support the new hardware also resulted in compatibility problems with some older software that did not follow published guidelines.

The 1200XL ended up with functionality similar to the existing 800, but at a hefty price point. For all of these reasons the 1200XL sold poorly. There is an often-repeated story, perhaps apocryphal, that 800 sales shot up after the release of the 1200XL, as existing owners tried to snap them up before they disappeared. The machine was discontinued in 1983. There was no PAL version of the 1200XL.

		<desc>Astro Fighter is a 2-D, space shooter style game. Your job is to protect the various sectors from the hoards of invading aliens. You will have to defeat four waves of alien spaceships in order to dock with the 'GS' ship and refuel. In addition to battling the alien spaceships, you will also have to dodge bombs that seem to come out of nowhere. Armed only with your fighter and a lot of spirit, you must ensure that you clear the screen of invaders before they pass you by. All in all, another walk in the park.</desc>

		<name>After Burner II</name>
		<desc>After Burner is another Sega game rendered with their then-ubiquitous 3-D sprite-scaling technology; this time putting the player into the seat of a powerful F14 Tomcat jet fighter. 

Players must fight their way through 21 colourful, fast-moving stages, shooting down waves of enemy fighters while avoiding the enemy's incoming missiles. The F14 is equipped with a machine gun and a limited number of homing missiles. The gun has infinite ammunition and targeting is achieved by maneuvering the Tomcat so that the targeting cursor situated just in front of the jet is placed over an enemy fighter. 

After Burner's straightforward shoot-em-up gameplay is simple and repetitive, but the game's incredible visuals ensured its success.</desc>

		<name>After Burner II</name>
		<desc>After Burner is another Sega game rendered with their then-ubiquitous 3-D sprite-scaling technology; this time putting the player into the seat of a powerful F14 Tomcat jet fighter. 

Players must fight their way through 21 colourful, fast-moving stages, shooting down waves of enemy fighters while avoiding the enemy's incoming missiles. The F14 is equipped with a machine gun and a limited number of homing missiles. The gun has infinite ammunition and targeting is achieved by maneuvering the Tomcat so that the targeting cursor situated just in front of the jet is placed over an enemy fighter. 

After Burner's straightforward shoot-em-up gameplay is simple and repetitive, but the game's incredible visuals ensured its success.</desc>

		<name>ZZZ(notgame):Arcana Heart</name>
		<desc>The elemental world and the human world, which in ancient times were one, are two spaces in which the Arcana and the Humans live respectively. The Ministry of Elemental Affairs ensures that these two worlds never meet, in order to preserve humanity.

However, a dimensional rift begins to form over Tokyo. All of humanity's hopes now rest on the Maidens, young girls who can communicate with the Arcana.

The combat system consists of 4 buttons: weak move, medium move, strong move and special attack. Battles take place in two rounds, where the opponent's life gauge must be emptied. Various combos can be performed using the buttons and directional controls.

Each player has a "SUPER" bar divided into 9 levels. It fills up as you hit. It allows to trigger special moves called "Arcana Force" and "Super Attacks".</desc>

		<name>Acrobat Mission</name>
		<desc>A great vertical scrolling shoot'em up game.

At the year 2100 A.D. Humans were exterminated by their own self-destructive nature leaving behind the consequences of environmental degradation on earth and were forced to escape to Mars leaving a bio-computer for environmental recuperation of earth to preparing the blue planet for future recolonization. But one day a half a century after humans arrived, mars was attacked by strange flying objects. To fight these enemies, the director general of the Defence Agency organized the task force army and started quickly the dogfight with invaders to neutralize the invasion. 

The operation was called 'Acrobat Mission' as it exceeded the technical limits of the pilots.

The players takes controls on one of two surviving fighters pilots, 'Jet' a male pilot and 'Nova' a female pilot and both flying the Icarus, a fast and powerful space-fighter, which comes equipped with a Standard laser. Two more weapons are available throughout the game - the wide shot (W) which spreads out in front of the ship and the Hurricane shot (H) which fires clusters of rotating balls of energy. Holding the fire button charges up a special attack and each weapon features a different energy blast and damage factor. The ships can also hold a maximum of two smart-bombs, one under each wing - although they can be activated by the players, they also do fall off easily and can be detonated by enemy shots. Interestingly, the Icarus can't collide with other ships or any part of the scenery - instead, it bounces off and only suffers damage from enemy shots. However, once the shield is depleted, the ship will fly out of control for a few seconds and grant the players a last chance to inflict damage to any remaining enemies before it explodes.</desc>
