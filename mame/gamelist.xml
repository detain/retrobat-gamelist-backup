005 (c) 1981 Sega.

Agent 005 brings new cash collections to you. His mission is to deliver secret attache cases to an awaiting helicopter. Through wily street chases and the shadows of warehouse darkness to slippery skating rink maneuvers and the blazing aerial getaway fight. Agent 005 steels the scene and delivers customers to you. Fun-filled music attracts them. Four thrilling escape scenes challenge them and the continuous fun keeps them playing and playing. The unique audio and video excitement matches every players skill level.

And 005 is a RasterScan Convert, a Game which can later be converted to a brand new top earning game at a substantial savings.

Put Agent 005 on your side and win the chase for higher profits. For more information on the latest in video-game action, call your nearest Sega/Gremlin distributor.

The chase is on. Agent 005 makes away with an attache case. A hovering helicopter awaits his arrival, but first... Enemy guards pound the street in pursuit. 005 must duck into a new scene.

Inside a warehouse. Avoid being caught in the guard's flashlight beams... once 005 is detected, the chase quickens to super fast. Blast the guards with stun-gas and score valuable points.

Slip into a skate rink. And slip you will. There is no stopping on ice and the same goes for the thrills. Sliding and firing... firing and sliding. 005 can call his helicopter to escape.

The final flight fight. High flying aerial excitement. 005 has reached his helicopter in all other scenes and now finds his high scoring, high soaring getaway copter in a new test balloon and parachute bombs close in from all sides. 005 blast away to score points and to escape. Then the final challenge is thrown at his skill - a blazing battle with the enemy copter. Win now and you win big.

It's free-wheeling fun with fun-filled music and sound. Its stealth and pursuit is like no other video game. Everybody's after Agent 005. You should be, too. Call your nearest Sega/Gremlin distributor today and make sure 005 is on your side.

This game came in a generic Sega wood grain panel cabinet (sticker sideart was optional). These were technically all dedicated cabinets, although the lack of any painted art makes the machines easy to switch and still retain originality (a lot of early Sega titles came in this same cabinet). The game boards themselves were Sega G80 System compatible (as were several other Sega titles before "Zaxxon"), and will work in any G80 cabinet. The monitor is mounted vertically, as were most early Sega titles. The monitor bezel sported the standard game instructions and the marquee showed a '005' logo and a shining flashlight.

- TRIVIA -

005 was released in October 1981 in Japan by Sega. It was then exported in USA by Gremlin Industries and released there in December 1981.

005 (pronounced 'double O five'), is based around a pseudo 'James Bond' theme. Instead of secret 'agent 007' you get to play secret 'agent 005' (which allowed Sega to save money by not licensing the 'James Bond' character for this game).

Original 005 PCBs are very rare today, as most of them were converted to "Monster Bash" when it came out.

Dwayne Richard holds the record for this game with 1,500,000 points on July 25, 1982.

Attache delivered to helicopter = 5,000 points.
Guard knocked out = 200 points.

Entering a building with:
No stun gas cannister = 500 points.
One stun gas cannister = 500 points.
Two stun gas cannisters = 500 points.

Shooting down:
Shrubbery = 50 points.
Balloon Bomb = 200 points.
Enemy helicopter = 5,000+ points.
(1,000 X no. of brief cases delivered)

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Agent 005's mission: evade enemy guards, negotiate warehouses and skating rinks to deliver attache cases to a waiting helicopter, which in turn must engage in an aerial battle with parachute bombs, balloon bombs and an enemy helicopter. Game play begins as 005 parachutes into the scene and picks up an attache case. To make a run for the helicopter straightaway is difficult and accumulates fewer points. His alternative is to duck into either a warehouse or skating rink.

Armed with a stun gun to ward off pursuing guards, 005 can select a building with either 1, 2 or no stun gun cannisters at the entrance. Gas cannisters extend the stun gun's range and add more points. Fallen guards can be passed by other guards, but not by 005. Once inside the building, the scene changes to the interior of that building. In the skating rink, 005 must travel the rink's perimeter, luring the guards onto the ice to stun or evade them. Caution must be exercised here, as 005 can change direction, but cannot stop until he hits the edge of the rink. A successful rendez-vous with the helicopter completes that delivery and shifts the scene back to 005 parachuting in to pick up another brief case. Once having been in the skating rink, only warehouses are there to-enter, and conversely, if a warehouse was first entered, only skating rinks are available. In later rounds however, both skating rinks and warehouses are displayed. In the warehouse, 005 moves cautiously in the dark, but is pursued once caught in the beam of a guard's flashlight. Again, a helicopter waits to pick up our hero as he makes his way out the far end.

Now in possession of two attache cases, 005 is pursued by an enemy helicopter. Avoiding hedges, shrubbery, descending helicopter bombs, and ascending balloon bombs, points are scored as 005 shoots balloon bombs, shrubbery or the enemy helicopter. The game ends if 005 is caught, or his helicopter is shot down a total of three times (operator selectable).

10-Yard Fight (c) 1983 Irem Corp.

It's 3rd and 10. The crowd is on its feet. Cheers fill the stadium. "36-88-24. Hut-hut-hut." The ball is snapped. You grip the hard, cold, pigskin and the game is in your hands. You scramble left to avoid a flying tackle and look downfield. A receiver is open. You pump a forward pass. It's complete for a 10 yard gain and a first down.

That's the rush the player gets with 10-YARD FIGHT, the 1- or 2-player video with the continuous play feature. The thrill of controlling the action. Of calling the plays and carrying the ball. Of a real Pro contest of America's # 1 Game.

The player takes the field, takes the ball and takes on as much action as he can handle. He must score a touchdown in the time allotted to go from high school and college all the way to the Pros and the Super Bowl, with cheerleaders marking his progress-in-between.

Each level begins with the player carrying the ball on the kick-off as far up the field as he can before getting tackled. Then he's in control as quarterback, running with the ball or going for a forwards pass or a lateral to a receiver who let's him know he's open by waving his arms. If the pass is intercepted a 20 yard penalty is called. As in authentic Pro ball, the clock is stopped when the player runs out of bounds. For bonus points after the referee signals a touchdown, the player can kick the ball or run with it to score "points after". 

10 YARD FIGHT
It lets YOU score like a Pro at the cashbox!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

1. A spectacular American Football Game, in which the player is kept on full alert by the sheer excitement of the game, the player having to make a touch-down within the time allotted.
2. From kickoff the player catches the ball kicked by a defensive player, and rushes ahead as far as possible avoiding the opposing players by moving the joystick left and right.
3. If the player can gain 10 or more yards by the fourth down, he automatically receives "First Down", giving him another 4 offensive plays. If a first down is not obtained in 4 plays, the player is penalised 10 yards.
4. When the player tackled by the defence, rotate the lever in a 360-degree arc quickly before he falls down, the player can get free from the tackle, but remember that player can use this technique only 3 times in each play.

* Passing Play:
1. Player can pass the ball only when the pass receiver is raising his hand. (The ball can be passed sideways and then forward consecutively.)
2. If the ball is thrown to the pass receiver should be intercepted by the opponents, player wil be penalised 20 yards.
3. If player steps ahead of the line of scrimmage the ball can no longer be passed and the pass button becomes inoperative.
Additional time is given every time player succeeds in making touchdown, and every time he gains a first down.


* Don't pass if the line of the pass will take the ball anywhere near a free-running defender.

* At the kickoff, you should aim to get to at least the opponents' 40 yard line, if not further. Use your rear defenders on the run up the field!

* When making a play, look carefully at the your opponent's deployment. Are they all over the right hand side? Then wait till your runner is over the left, get the ball back to the quarterback and pass straight to the running back. Then leg it straight up the left hand side. When doing this, on either side, keep as close to the edge of the pitch as possible. If you're going to get tackled, quickly dodge off the field to end the play.

* You can also send the running back up the field, and run around with the quarterback until there's a pass available. In the arcade, I used to send the running back way up the right to the very top of the screen, and then run back and left with the quarterback as quickly as possible, doing a huge cross-field throw at the last second. The opponents would get sort of 'caught in the scroll' as the ball went diagonally across and most times the running back would be away with no one anywhere near him.

* You can also run the quarterback straight through the pack - this is only sensible when you're at the 5 yard line or so.

* Down the ball as soon as you make 10 yards if you have any time left. This is because you can make 10 yards in 15 seconds and get 10 seconds back for a net loss of 5 seconds. It takes 30 seconds to make 20 yards and doing it in 1 play will get a net loss of 20 seconds (30 - 10), but doing it in 2 will only lose 10 seconds because you get 2 10 second bonuses (30 - 10 - 10). Once the clock runs out in mid-play just go as far as you can and hope it's enough to get more time.

* Learn the defense formations. Once you find the correct pass route for a particular formation it will work consistently.

* If you see a hard formation and you are short on time, your best move may be throwing an interception and hoping for an easier formation. This works best when you have 7 to 10 seconds left and don't think you can make ten yards or get downed before time runs out. Don't try it with less than 7 seconds though. 6:xx probably won't be enough time.

* Run to the right during 'first contact' after the kickoff. There is an extra computer guy waiting on the left side. The best way to use the top blockers is to let the middle blocker connect, move straight right until the top right blocker connects, then head up again.

* You can do a forward pass after a lateral. This will cut through a few formations that are hard passing from the quarterback position. If you time it well a diagonal pass left (right running back to a left receiver) can miss an active middle defender.

* If you run the ball, use the receiver to block for you. The game doesn't have 'pass interference' calls so you have to be careful not to do this by accident.

- TRIVIA -

This game is an adaptation of "50 Lions" to a standard 5 reel, 3 symbol per reel layout. Unlike 50 Lions which has 50 different paylines, this game has 25 paylines. The gameplay is identical to "Sun Queen" and "Love Stuck". 

The game's name is a reference to the maximum number of lions which could fill the screen if the reels lined up.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

All pays are left to right including scatters.

Diamond appears on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 and substitutes for all symbols except scatters.

Feature: Spin up 3 scattered Proteas to trigger the feature. An additional 5 free games can be won once during the feature, giving the player a maximum of 15 free games. If the Proteas are spun up more than once in the free games, only the scatter win is paid.

During the free games, one wild Diamond is progressively added to reels 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the remaining games. Additional Diamonds are placed underneath one another, forming a row of wild Diamonds in each reel. The player can have as many as twelve Diamonds on the screen from as early as the third free game.

NEW: 18 WHEELER
Electro-Mechanical Game Excitement by Midway - a Bally Company.

KING OF THE ROAD!

- TECHNICAL -

[Game No. 653]

- TRIVIA -

18 Wheeler was released in July 1979 in North America.

Developed by Arcade Engineering.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Player presses START button, shifts into 1st, 'hits the hammer' and the 18 WHEELER is on its way. The object is to keep the truck on the road, pick up cargo and make time. A shift into 2nd and 3rd gear, at appropriate MPH, creates faster action, more speed ans greater score. The game requires agility and coordination. Just about every limb is in motion. The left hand steers the authentic BIG WHEEL, the right hand operates the genuine GEAR SHIFT, the right foot works THE HAMMER accelerator and the AIR BRAKE stop.

* Shifting: For Highway Cat and Stream Line, shift up when at about 50 mph.

Control: 8-way joystick
Buttons: 2

- TRIVIA -

1941 was released in February 1990 in the Japanese arcades as the 7th CP-S release. It is the first Shoot'em Up to add +1 to the score when a continue is used.

Player 1 uses a P-38 Lightning and Player 2 uses a Mosquito B Mk.IV.

Soundtrack album releases:
Final Fight: G.S.M. Capcom 3 (PCCB-00030) (May 21, 1990) [Pony Canyon / Scitron]

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* How to Play:
Control airplane with 8-way joystick.
Attack with button A.
Somersault &amp; Mega-Crash with Button B.
Power Blast: If the A button is held down, energy will be stored up, so that a power blast is fired when the button is released.

* Hint: Your airplane doesn't lose energy when it collides with cliff-walls, buildings etc. Instead it will rotate a bit after such collisions. That means you can tumble up and down these obstacles (keep on colliding), and if you keep shooting, your shots will go in all directions. This way you can clear up a lot of enemies when you are under pressure (while rolling you are invincible).

1942 (c) 1984 Capcom.

1942 is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Pacific theatre during World War II, in which the goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet. 

The player pilots a plane dubbed the 'Super Ace' and has to shoot down waves of enemy planes while avoiding incoming enemy fire. The 'Super Ace' can perform a limited number of rolls or 'loop-the-loops' to evade enemy planes and shots. Just two lives are given to the player.

During the game, waves of red enemy planes periodically appear. If the player manages to destroy a red wave, a power-up, in the form of a 'POW' symbol, will be dropped and can be picked up. The power-up will award either increased fire-power (doubling the player's guns from two to four), a smart bomb that destroys all on-screen enemy planes the instant it's collected, two wingmen planes that flank the Super Ace and increase fire power, or simply extra points.

At the end of each stage the 'Super Ace' lands on an aircraft carrier and bonus points are awarded based on player performance. 1942 differs from other games in that its levels are numbered in reverse order, so the game begins at stage 32 and ends at stage 1.

- TRIVIA -

1942 was released in December 1984 in Japan. 1942 wasn't a Yoshiki Okamoto title, but designed by his former-classmate who joined Capcom a few years afterwards.

The plane is a lockheed P-38 Lightning, the same type which was flown by Richard Bong in the Second World War. He was America's top ace, credited with shooting down 40 Japanese planes.

It was the first Capcom title to spawn a successful series of sequels, with six titles in the 19XX line released from 1984 to 2000.

In the default high-score table, some previous Capcom Games appear. Since the Demo Mode only shows the top five, you need to play the game and to make a score of approximately 10,000 points (To enter in the top ten).
The number 5 (20,000 points) appears as 'EXEDEXES'.
Number 6 is 'VULGUS' (9,999 points).
Number 7 is 'SONSON' (8,888 points).
Number 8 is 'HIGEMARU' (7,777 points).
Number 9 is again 'EXEDEXES' (6,666 points).

The game ROM contains an unused Bomb sprite and an unused Star bonus items sprite.

Martin Bedard of Saint-Lazare, Quebec, Canada holds the record for this game with 13,360,960 points on November 19, 2006.

- UPDATES -

In the two oldest versions of the game, there's a bug in the scoring system for earning bonus lives. This bug was fixed in Revision B.

- SCORING -

Small planes are 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, or 200 points each.

The small red planes that fly formations of five or ten are 100 points each. Shooting all the planes in the five-plane formation awards 500 bonus points. Shooting all the planes in the ten-plane formation awards 1,000 bonus points. In both cases, when the last plane of a formation is destroyed, a power-up marker appears and is worth 1,000 points when picked up.

Occasionally a small airplane comes slowly out of the lower left or lower right hand side of the screen and flies towards the top. When hit, it turns into a special figure which awards 5,000 points when picked up.

Medium size planes are 1,000 or 1,500 points each.

Large bomber planes start at 2,000 points each. The score for each consecutive bomber destroyed without the player dying is 500 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 9,000 points. When the player’s ship is destroyed, the score for the bombers is reset back to 2,000 points.

There are four boss planes. They appear at the end of stages 26, 18, 10, and 02:
The stage 26 boss plane is worth 20,000 points.
The stage 18 boss plane is worth 30,000 points.
The stage 10 boss plane is worth 40,000 points.
The stage 02 boss plane is worth 50,000 points.

For all enemy planes that require more than one hit to kill, each hit on them gives 100 points.

At the end of each stage a bonus is awarded for shooting down percentage and for unused loops:
100% = Special bonus 50,000 points (in older revisions, the game displays 10,000 points bonus but 50,000 points are actually awarded).
95-99% = 20,000 points
90-94% = 10,000 points
85-89% = 5,000 points
80-84% = 4,000 points
70-79% = 3,000 points
60-69% = 2,000 points
50-59% = 1,000 points
Under 50% = 0 points
Unused loops are 1,000 points each.

Finishing the final stage awards 10,000,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* On Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04, a V-formation of red planes will come straight down from the top. If all five of the planes are destroyed, a Black/Red POW appears, giving the player an extra airplane when picked up.

* On stages with the wingman power-ups, use them to kill off the large bombers easily by crashing a wingman into them. You will get a second chance to get them back later on.

* On the stages with the boss planes, save all your loops; shoot at it quickly, loop down to avoid the shots, shoot at it again and THEN loop. You should be able to kill it this way.

* Most of the time it is easier to keep only one wingman rather than both; that way it's easier to maneuver around enemies. If you miss the red airplanes that give you the wingman powerup, kill off your plane (assuming you have some remaining) and the game will place you back before them.

* An interesting bug: If you win an extra plane from points when killing a boss plane, no extra planes will be awarded on the basis of points. Extra planes can still be obtained by getting the Black/Red POW, but no point-based bonuses will be awarded for the rest of the game.

* The end of stage bonus for 100% shooting down is actually 50,000 points, even though the game displays a 'special' bonus of only 10,000 points.

When the player loses all of his ships, the game offers to continue for another credit. If this option is chosen, the game continues where it left off but the score is reset to zero.

* There are six kinds of powerups: Quad fire, destroy all enemies on screen, two wingmen, make enemies stop shooting temporarily, extra loop, and extra life. Note that the destroy all enemies powerup does not destroy the small slow plane that has the 5,000 bonus item pickup.

Quad fire power-ups are found on Stages 32, 28, 24, 20, 16, 12, 08, and 04.
Destroy all enemies power-ups are found on Stages 31, 21, 19, 18, 11, 07, 03, and 01.
Wingman power-ups are found on Stages 30, 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 06, and 02.
Extra life power-ups are found on Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04.
Stop shooting power-ups are found on Stages 27 and 15. 
Extra loop power-ups are found on Stages 23, 18, 17, 13, 09, and 05.

* % and point up Stages are 29, 25, 21, 17, 13, 09, 05, 01. During these stages none of the enemies fire on the player except the large bomber planes.

* If the player earns enough bonus planes so that ten ships or more are in the reserve, the ten remaining ships indicators are replaced by the Greek letter Sigma (?).

Small planes are 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, or 200 points each.

The small red planes that fly formations of five or ten are 100 points each. Shooting all the planes in the five-plane formation awards 500 bonus points. Shooting all the planes in the ten-plane formation awards 1,000 bonus points. In both cases, when the last plane of a formation is destroyed, a power-up marker appears and is worth 1,000 points when picked up.

Occasionally a small airplane comes slowly out of the lower left or lower right hand side of the screen and flies towards the top. When hit, it turns into a special figure which awards 5,000 points when picked up.

There are four boss planes. They appear at the end of stages 26, 18, 10, and 02:

For all enemy planes that require more than one hit to kill, each hit on them gives 100 points.

At the end of each stage a bonus is awarded for shooting down percentage and for unused loops:
100% = Special bonus 50,000 points (in older revisions, the game displays 10,000 points bonus but 50,000 points are actually awarded).
95-99% = 20,000 points
90-94% = 10,000 points
85-89% = 5,000 points
80-84% = 4,000 points
70-79% = 3,000 points
60-69% = 2,000 points
50-59% = 1,000 points
Under 50% = 0 points
Unused loops are 1,000 points each.

Finishing the final stage awards 10,000,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* On Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04, a V-formation of red planes will come straight down from the top. If all five of the planes are destroyed, a Black/Red POW appears, giving the player an extra airplane when picked up.

* On stages with the wingman power-ups, use them to kill off the large bombers easily by crashing a wingman into them. You will get a second chance to get them back later on.

* On the stages with the boss planes, save all your loops; shoot at it quickly, loop down to avoid the shots, shoot at it again and THEN loop. You should be able to kill it this way.

* Most of the time it is easier to keep only one wingman rather than both; that way it's easier to maneuver around enemies. If you miss the red airplanes that give you the wingman powerup, kill off your plane (assuming you have some remaining) and the game will place you back before them.

* An interesting bug: If you win an extra plane from points when killing a boss plane, no extra planes will be awarded on the basis of points. Extra planes can still be obtained by getting the Black/Red POW, but no point-based bonuses will be awarded for the rest of the game.

* The end of stage bonus for 100% shooting down is actually 50,000 points, even though the game displays a 'special' bonus of only 10,000 points.

When the player loses all of his ships, the game offers to continue for another credit. If this option is chosen, the game continues where it left off but the score is reset to zero.

* There are six kinds of powerups: Quad fire, destroy all enemies on screen, two wingmen, make enemies stop shooting temporarily, extra loop, and extra life. Note that the destroy all enemies powerup does not destroy the small slow plane that has the 5,000 bonus item pickup.

Quad fire power-ups are found on Stages 32, 28, 24, 20, 16, 12, 08, and 04.
Destroy all enemies power-ups are found on Stages 31, 21, 19, 18, 11, 07, 03, and 01.
Wingman power-ups are found on Stages 30, 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 06, and 02.
Extra life power-ups are found on Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04.
Stop shooting power-ups are found on Stages 27 and 15. 
Extra loop power-ups are found on Stages 23, 18, 17, 13, 09, and 05.

* % and point up Stages are 29, 25, 21, 17, 13, 09, 05, 01. During these stages none of the enemies fire on the player except the large bomber planes.

* If the player earns enough bonus planes so that ten ships or more are in the reserve, the ten remaining ships indicators are replaced by the Greek letter Sigma (?).

1942 (c) 1984 Capcom.

1942 is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Pacific theatre during World War II, in which the goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet. 

The player pilots a plane dubbed the 'Super Ace' and has to shoot down waves of enemy planes while avoiding incoming enemy fire. The 'Super Ace' can perform a limited number of rolls or 'loop-the-loops' to evade enemy planes and shots. Just two lives are given to the player.

During the game, waves of red enemy planes periodically appear. If the player manages to destroy a red wave, a power-up, in the form of a 'POW' symbol, will be dropped and can be picked up. The power-up will award either increased fire-power (doubling the player's guns from two to four), a smart bomb that destroys all on-screen enemy planes the instant it's collected, two wingmen planes that flank the Super Ace and increase fire power, or simply extra points.

At the end of each stage the 'Super Ace' lands on an aircraft carrier and bonus points are awarded based on player performance. 1942 differs from other games in that its levels are numbered in reverse order, so the game begins at stage 32 and ends at stage 1.

- TRIVIA -

1942 was released in December 1984 in Japan. 1942 wasn't a Yoshiki Okamoto title, but designed by his former-classmate who joined Capcom a few years afterwards.

The plane is a lockheed P-38 Lightning, the same type which was flown by Richard Bong in the Second World War. He was America's top ace, credited with shooting down 40 Japanese planes.

It was the first Capcom title to spawn a successful series of sequels, with six titles in the 19XX line released from 1984 to 2000.

Stage names:
Stages 32–29: Midway
Stages 28–25: Marshall
Stages 24–21: Attu
Stages 20–17: Rabaul
Stages 16–13: Leyte
Stages 12–09: Saipan
Stages 08–05: Iwojima
Stages 04–01: Okinawa

After the last boss plane on stage 02 is destroyed the screen displays: 
CONGRATULATION
YOU ARE THE BEST OF PLAYER !
FIGHT LAST ONE STAGE

Stage 01 is displayed as LAST STAGE.

After the last stage is complete the screen displays: 
WE GIVE UP!
SPECIAL BONUS
10000000 PTS

Default High-score table ('Top 5 ranking score!!'):

2ND 35000 ALL 0
3RD 30000 RIGHT 0
4TH 25000 RESERVED 0
5TH 20000 EXEDEXES 0

In the default high-score table, some previous Capcom Games appear. Since the Demo Mode only shows the top five, you need to play the game and to make a score of approximately 10,000 points (To enter in the top ten).
The number 5 (20,000 points) appears as 'EXEDEXES'.
Number 6 is 'VULGUS' (9,999 points).
Number 7 is 'SONSON' (8,888 points).
Number 8 is 'HIGEMARU' (7,777 points).
Number 9 is again 'EXEDEXES' (6,666 points).

The game ROM contains an unused Bomb sprite and an unused Star bonus items sprite.

Martin Bedard of Saint-Lazare, Quebec, Canada holds the record for this game with 13,360,960 points on November 19, 2006.

- UPDATES -

In the two oldest versions of the game, there's a bug in the scoring system for earning bonus lives. This bug was fixed in Revision B.

- SCORING -

Small planes are 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, or 200 points each.

The small red planes that fly formations of five or ten are 100 points each. Shooting all the planes in the five-plane formation awards 500 bonus points. Shooting all the planes in the ten-plane formation awards 1,000 bonus points. In both cases, when the last plane of a formation is destroyed, a power-up marker appears and is worth 1,000 points when picked up.

Occasionally a small airplane comes slowly out of the lower left or lower right hand side of the screen and flies towards the top. When hit, it turns into a special figure which awards 5,000 points when picked up.

Medium size planes are 1,000 or 1,500 points each.

Large bomber planes start at 2,000 points each. The score for each consecutive bomber destroyed without the player dying is 500 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 9,000 points. When the player’s ship is destroyed, the score for the bombers is reset back to 2,000 points.

There are four boss planes. They appear at the end of stages 26, 18, 10, and 02:
The stage 26 boss plane is worth 20,000 points.
The stage 18 boss plane is worth 30,000 points.
The stage 10 boss plane is worth 40,000 points.
The stage 02 boss plane is worth 50,000 points.

For all enemy planes that require more than one hit to kill, each hit on them gives 100 points.

At the end of each stage a bonus is awarded for shooting down percentage and for unused loops:
100% = Special bonus 50,000 points (in older revisions, the game displays 10,000 points bonus but 50,000 points are actually awarded).
95-99% = 20,000 points
90-94% = 10,000 points
85-89% = 5,000 points
80-84% = 4,000 points
70-79% = 3,000 points
60-69% = 2,000 points
50-59% = 1,000 points
Under 50% = 0 points
Unused loops are 1,000 points each.

Finishing the final stage awards 10,000,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* On Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04, a V-formation of red planes will come straight down from the top. If all five of the planes are destroyed, a Black/Red POW appears, giving the player an extra airplane when picked up.

* On stages with the wingman power-ups, use them to kill off the large bombers easily by crashing a wingman into them. You will get a second chance to get them back later on.

* On the stages with the boss planes, save all your loops; shoot at it quickly, loop down to avoid the shots, shoot at it again and THEN loop. You should be able to kill it this way.

* Most of the time it is easier to keep only one wingman rather than both; that way it's easier to maneuver around enemies. If you miss the red airplanes that give you the wingman powerup, kill off your plane (assuming you have some remaining) and the game will place you back before them.

* An interesting bug: If you win an extra plane from points when killing a boss plane, no extra planes will be awarded on the basis of points. Extra planes can still be obtained by getting the Black/Red POW, but no point-based bonuses will be awarded for the rest of the game.

* The end of stage bonus for 100% shooting down is actually 50,000 points, even though the game displays a 'special' bonus of only 10,000 points.

When the player loses all of his ships, the game offers to continue for another credit. If this option is chosen, the game continues where it left off but the score is reset to zero.

* There are six kinds of powerups: Quad fire, destroy all enemies on screen, two wingmen, make enemies stop shooting temporarily, extra loop, and extra life. Note that the destroy all enemies powerup does not destroy the small slow plane that has the 5,000 bonus item pickup.

Quad fire power-ups are found on Stages 32, 28, 24, 20, 16, 12, 08, and 04.
Destroy all enemies power-ups are found on Stages 31, 21, 19, 18, 11, 07, 03, and 01.
Wingman power-ups are found on Stages 30, 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 06, and 02.
Extra life power-ups are found on Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04.
Stop shooting power-ups are found on Stages 27 and 15. 
Extra loop power-ups are found on Stages 23, 18, 17, 13, 09, and 05.

* % and point up Stages are 29, 25, 21, 17, 13, 09, 05, 01. During these stages none of the enemies fire on the player except the large bomber planes.

* If the player earns enough bonus planes so that ten ships or more are in the reserve, the ten remaining ships indicators are replaced by the Greek letter Sigma (?).

1942 (c) 1984 Capcom.

1942 is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Pacific theatre during World War II, in which the goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet. 

The player pilots a plane dubbed the 'Super Ace' and has to shoot down waves of enemy planes while avoiding incoming enemy fire. The 'Super Ace' can perform a limited number of rolls or 'loop-the-loops' to evade enemy planes and shots. Just two lives are given to the player.

During the game, waves of red enemy planes periodically appear. If the player manages to destroy a red wave, a power-up, in the form of a 'POW' symbol, will be dropped and can be picked up. The power-up will award either increased fire-power (doubling the player's guns from two to four), a smart bomb that destroys all on-screen enemy planes the instant it's collected, two wingmen planes that flank the Super Ace and increase fire power, or simply extra points.

At the end of each stage the 'Super Ace' lands on an aircraft carrier and bonus points are awarded based on player performance. 1942 differs from other games in that its levels are numbered in reverse order, so the game begins at stage 32 and ends at stage 1.

- TRIVIA -

1942 was released in December 1984 in Japan. 1942 wasn't a Yoshiki Okamoto title, but designed by his former-classmate who joined Capcom a few years afterwards.

The plane is a lockheed P-38 Lightning, the same type which was flown by Richard Bong in the Second World War. He was America's top ace, credited with shooting down 40 Japanese planes.

It was the first Capcom title to spawn a successful series of sequels, with six titles in the 19XX line released from 1984 to 2000.

Stage names:
Stages 32–29: Midway
Stages 28–25: Marshall

Stages 20–17: Rabaul
Stages 16–13: Leyte
Stages 12–09: Saipan
Stages 08–05: Iwojima

After the last boss plane on stage 02 is destroyed the screen displays: 
CONGRATULATION

FIGHT LAST ONE STAGE

Stage 01 is displayed as LAST STAGE.

After the last stage is complete the screen displays:

4TH 25000 RESERVED 0
5TH 20000 EXEDEXES 0

In the default high-score table, some previous Capcom Games appear. Since the Demo Mode only shows the top five, you need to play the game and to make a score of approximately 10,000 points (To enter in the top ten).
The number 5 (20,000 points) appears as 'EXEDEXES'.
Number 6 is 'VULGUS' (9,999 points).
Number 7 is 'SONSON' (8,888 points).
Number 8 is 'HIGEMARU' (7,777 points).
Number 9 is again 'EXEDEXES' (6,666 points).

The game ROM contains an unused Bomb sprite and an unused Star bonus items sprite.

Martin Bedard of Saint-Lazare, Quebec, Canada holds the record for this game with 13,360,960 points on November 19, 2006.

- UPDATES -

In the two oldest versions of the game, there's a bug in the scoring system for earning bonus lives. This bug was fixed in Revision B.

- SCORING -

Small planes are 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, or 200 points each.

The small red planes that fly formations of five or ten are 100 points each. Shooting all the planes in the five-plane formation awards 500 bonus points. Shooting all the planes in the ten-plane formation awards 1,000 bonus points. In both cases, when the last plane of a formation is destroyed, a power-up marker appears and is worth 1,000 points when picked up.

Occasionally a small airplane comes slowly out of the lower left or lower right hand side of the screen and flies towards the top. When hit, it turns into a special figure which awards 5,000 points when picked up.

Medium size planes are 1,000 or 1,500 points each.

Large bomber planes start at 2,000 points each. The score for each consecutive bomber destroyed without the player dying is 500 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 9,000 points. When the player’s ship is destroyed, the score for the bombers is reset back to 2,000 points.

There are four boss planes. They appear at the end of stages 26, 18, 10, and 02:
The stage 26 boss plane is worth 20,000 points.
The stage 18 boss plane is worth 30,000 points.
The stage 10 boss plane is worth 40,000 points.
The stage 02 boss plane is worth 50,000 points.

For all enemy planes that require more than one hit to kill, each hit on them gives 100 points.

At the end of each stage a bonus is awarded for shooting down percentage and for unused loops:
100% = Special bonus 50,000 points (in older revisions, the game displays 10,000 points bonus but 50,000 points are actually awarded).
95-99% = 20,000 points
90-94% = 10,000 points
85-89% = 5,000 points
80-84% = 4,000 points
70-79% = 3,000 points
60-69% = 2,000 points
50-59% = 1,000 points
Under 50% = 0 points
Unused loops are 1,000 points each.

Finishing the final stage awards 10,000,000 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* On Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04, a V-formation of red planes will come straight down from the top. If all five of the planes are destroyed, a Black/Red POW appears, giving the player an extra airplane when picked up.

* On stages with the wingman power-ups, use them to kill off the large bombers easily by crashing a wingman into them. You will get a second chance to get them back later on.

* On the stages with the boss planes, save all your loops; shoot at it quickly, loop down to avoid the shots, shoot at it again and THEN loop. You should be able to kill it this way.

* Most of the time it is easier to keep only one wingman rather than both; that way it's easier to maneuver around enemies. If you miss the red airplanes that give you the wingman powerup, kill off your plane (assuming you have some remaining) and the game will place you back before them.

* An interesting bug: If you win an extra plane from points when killing a boss plane, no extra planes will be awarded on the basis of points. Extra planes can still be obtained by getting the Black/Red POW, but no point-based bonuses will be awarded for the rest of the game.

* The end of stage bonus for 100% shooting down is actually 50,000 points, even though the game displays a 'special' bonus of only 10,000 points.

When the player loses all of his ships, the game offers to continue for another credit. If this option is chosen, the game continues where it left off but the score is reset to zero.

* There are six kinds of powerups: Quad fire, destroy all enemies on screen, two wingmen, make enemies stop shooting temporarily, extra loop, and extra life. Note that the destroy all enemies powerup does not destroy the small slow plane that has the 5,000 bonus item pickup.

Quad fire power-ups are found on Stages 32, 28, 24, 20, 16, 12, 08, and 04.
Destroy all enemies power-ups are found on Stages 31, 21, 19, 18, 11, 07, 03, and 01.
Wingman power-ups are found on Stages 30, 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 06, and 02.
Extra life power-ups are found on Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04.
Stop shooting power-ups are found on Stages 27 and 15. 
Extra loop power-ups are found on Stages 23, 18, 17, 13, 09, and 05.

* % and point up Stages are 29, 25, 21, 17, 13, 09, 05, 01. During these stages none of the enemies fire on the player except the large bomber planes.

* If the player earns enough bonus planes so that ten ships or more are in the reserve, the ten remaining ships indicators are replaced by the Greek letter Sigma (?).

* Full Ammunition Load: A little known trick in the game is to hold down the fire button at the very end of a board immediately after beating the boss. By holding down the button until the plane takes off in the subsequent board, the game gives you a full ammunition load (65 Seconds)! This trick only works every third board or so and it may even change your selected weapon. 

* The '100% accuracy' bonus refers NOT to how many planes you down during the round, but rather how many of the guns on the enemy aircraft carriers you get. For this reason, it's best to ignore the planes and concentrate on the ships - that's where the big points are. 

* It's possible to shoot one of the ships just before your plane dives in to battle the fleet, and that you can capture the flames that erupt from it. This gives a 10,000 point bonus. 

* At some points in the background there are 'shootable' patches which will yield a bonus when shot enough. They can be recognized by the sparks which will occur when your bullets hit them. One such bonus is on level one: it is on the lowest part of the second cloud bank to the left after the last large plane of the level appears. It appears as a cow. There is also another shootable area which appears after the first ship in the first level, in the water above it. 
1) The cow bonus is worth 20,000 points, and on the first level, it's followed by a strange object that looks like a dragonfly moving right to left across the screen. Shooting the dragonfly yields an additional 10,000 point bonus. 
2) The cow and dragonfly bonuses also appear on other rounds; the cow can sometimes be seen on the deck of a carrier! 
3) There's a bonus shaped like a spinning cat (!). When collected, it upgrades your weapon to a laser. 

* The 'star' bonus gives you 5,000 points when caught. It may also increase the capacity of your fuel gauge by eight units (mine went from 64 to 72 units). The white star also gives you the max seconds of weapon (if you get it with no weapon, the next time you get one you'll get 64 seconds instead of 20). 

* (This has been reported on level two, but may exist on other levels as well): Sometimes an astronaut will emerge from the side of the final (boss) ship and walk off the screen. Shoot it for 100,000 points! This happens most often when the command tower is shot repeatedly before the ship is destroyed. 

* If you get the 'propeller' power-up (it looks like a propeller over a circle), your energy level will be fully replenished. 

* Still another bonus is shaped like an pine cone or acorn. When you fly over a certain spot, the pine cone shows up and is worth 2,000 points. 

* When the boss ship explodes, the control center breaks into four pieces. The pieces are worth 10,000 points each if shot. 

* If you shoot a POW enough to cycle it through about four or five times, it will turn into a fuel-tank:) that helps a GREAT deal on the last few stages, especially a stage or two where they DON'T give you a full tank at the end of the cloud stage before you go to the water!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* How to Play:
A button is to shoot.
B button is to cause lightning, tsunami and cyclone.
Press both buttons simultaneously for loop (two loops per stage.)

Shoot POW to select power-up weapons.
POW: Gives additional energy to the player.
SHOTGUN: The ultimate weapon to destroy enemy bullets.
3-WAY SHOT: The player can shoot in three directions.
AUTO: It shoots 8 times while the button is pressed down.
SUPER SHELL: It shoots continuously while the button is pressed down. Double the power of normal bullets.
ENERGYTANK: Partial energy recovery.
SIDEFIGHTER: Increases offensive power.
YASHICHI: Maximum energy recovery.

* Choose Your Weapon: Hold these buttons at the beginning of each stage to activate the weapon... 
Stage 1 for a Small Shot Gun, press 1P side Down and 2P side A. 
Stage 2 for a Big Shot Gun, press 1P side A and 2P side B. 
Stage 3 for a Laser, press 1P side Upright+A+B and 2P side Down+B. 
Stage 4 for a Big Shot Gun, press 1P side Downleft+B and 2P side Leftup. 
Stage 5 for a 3-way, press 1P side A and 2P side Up. 
Stage 6 for an Auto, press 1P side Left and 2P side Right+B. 
Stage 7 for a Shell, press 1P side Upleft and 2P side Down. 
Stage 8 for a 3-way, press 1P side Left+A+B and 2P side A+B. 
Stage 9 for a Laser, press 1P side Downright+A+B and 2P side Downright+A+B. 
Stage 10 for a Shell, press 1P side Upright+B and 2P side Downright. 
Stage 11 for an Auto, press 1P side Upleft and 2P Right+A. 
Stage 12 for a 3-way, press 1P side Right+A+B and 2P side Upright+A+B. 
Stage 13 for an Auto, press 1P side Up and 2P side Down. 
Stage 14 for a Laser, press 1P side Upleft+A+B and 2P side Right+A+B. 
Stage 15 for a Shell, press 1P side Downright+A and 2P side Downleft+A. 
Stage 16 for an Auto, press 1P side Right+A and 2P side Upright+A. 

* Full Ammunition Load: A little known trick in the game is to hold down the fire button at the very end of a board immediately after beating the boss. By holding down the button until the plane takes off in the subsequent board, the game gives you a full ammunition load (65 Seconds)! This trick only works every third board or so and it may even change your selected weapon. 

* The '100% accuracy' bonus refers NOT to how many planes you down during the round, but rather how many of the guns on the enemy aircraft carriers you get. For this reason, it's best to ignore the planes and concentrate on the ships - that's where the big points are. 

* It's possible to shoot one of the ships just before your plane dives in to battle the fleet, and that you can capture the flames that erupt from it. This gives a 10,000 point bonus. 

* At some points in the background there are 'shootable' patches which will yield a bonus when shot enough. They can be recognized by the sparks which will occur when your bullets hit them. One such bonus is on level one: it is on the lowest part of the second cloud bank to the left after the last large plane of the level appears. It appears as a cow. There is also another shootable area which appears after the first ship in the first level, in the water above it. 
1) The cow bonus is worth 20,000 points, and on the first level, it's followed by a strange object that looks like a dragonfly moving right to left across the screen. Shooting the dragonfly yields an additional 10,000 point bonus. 
2) The cow and dragonfly bonuses also appear on other rounds; the cow can sometimes be seen on the deck of a carrier! 
3) There's a bonus shaped like a spinning cat (!). When collected, it upgrades your weapon to a laser. 

* The 'star' bonus gives you 5,000 points when caught. It may also increase the capacity of your fuel gauge by eight units (mine went from 64 to 72 units). The white star also gives you the max seconds of weapon (if you get it with no weapon, the next time you get one you'll get 64 seconds instead of 20). 

* (This has been reported on level two, but may exist on other levels as well): Sometimes an astronaut will emerge from the side of the final (boss) ship and walk off the screen. Shoot it for 100,000 points! This happens most often when the command tower is shot repeatedly before the ship is destroyed. 

* If you get the 'propeller' power-up (it looks like a propeller over a circle), your energy level will be fully replenished. 

* Still another bonus is shaped like an pine cone or acorn. When you fly over a certain spot, the pine cone shows up and is worth 2,000 points. 

* When the boss ship explodes, the control center breaks into four pieces. The pieces are worth 10,000 points each if shot. 

* If you shoot a POW enough to cycle it through about four or five times, it will turn into a fuel-tank:) that helps a GREAT deal on the last few stages, especially a stage or two where they DON'T give you a full tank at the end of the cloud stage before you go to the water!

- TRIVIA -

1944 - The Loop Master was released on June 20, 2000 in Japan. It was known as the 33th CPS-2 game.

Known export release: 
[US] "1944 - The Loop Master [Blue Board]" 

Like many other large companies as-of-late, Capcom has started farming out the programing of their games to third party companies. In this case, 1944 was made by 'Eighting / Raizing' and published by Capcom.

The Stage Clear background music samples "Green Onions", an instrumental piece by the R&amp;B band 'Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s', released in 1962.

The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'CAP'.

Default High-score table 'Score ranking':
(Rank - Name - Score - Stage - Destroy rate)
1st CAP 1000000pts. 3st1 90%
2nd COM 900000pts. 3st1 85%
3rd CAP 800000pts. 3st1 80%
4th COM 700000pts. 2st1 75%
5th CAP 600000pts. 2st1 70%
6th COM 500000pts. 2st1 65%
7th CAP 400000pts. 1st1 60%
8th COM 300000pts. 1st1 55%
9th CAP 200000pts. 1st1 50%
10th COM 100000pts. 1st1 45%

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* The game features 15 stages &amp; bosses:
Stage 01: The Deep Blue - Boss: High Speed Destroyer 'Nagi'
Stage 02: Iron Beast Warcry - Boss: New type heavy tank 'Shouto'
Stage 03: Jungle Fight - Boss: Prototype Attacker 'Akane'
Stage 04: The Rock Fortress - Boss: Cruising Tank 'Noroshi'
Stage 05: Eagle Territory - Boss: Intercontinental Bomber 'Kyuoh'
Stage 06: Devil Mountain - Boss: Special Attacker 'Haruka'
Stage 07: Nightmare Valley - Boss: Anti-Submarine Battle Cruiser 'Kai'
Stage 08: Fields Of War - Boss: Multi-Cannon Tank 'Ishizue'
Stage 09: Muddy Interceptor - Boss: Middle Class Bomber 'Akatsuki'
Stage 10: Storm Fortress - Boss: Super Gigantic Battleship 'Kaijin'
Stage 11: Oil Legion - Boss: Anti-Aircraft Battleship 'Yu'
Stage 12: Leviathan's Mouth - Boss: Twin-Bodied Transporter 'Take'
Stage 13: Battle Of Green Field - Boss: Gigantic Fighter 'Arashi'
Stage 14: The Last Duel - Boss: Railed Tank 'Goku'
Stage 15: Bell Of Triumph - Boss: Moving Fortress 'Appare Toride'

After destroying Stage 15 boss, the game ends if stage layout is set to 1 loop, or the game continues with stage 1 with enemy firing faster bullets, if the stage layout is set to endless.

* Hold FIRE to charge guns. When it is fully charged release FIRE. The plane will be INVINCIBLE for a short period of time and fire powerful low range projectiles. Then the guns will overheat preventing you from charging them for a short time.

* The mini fighters that appear beside your plane are destroyed after taking two hits. Destroyed side fighters are replaced if you have more in stock. During charge attacking or when there is no bomb, pushing BOMB makes side fighters charge forward for a powerful suicide attack.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* How to Play:
Hitting: 
[A] Swing/Return to base
[B] Stolen Base/Lead off
[C] Bunt
[D] Time Out

Fielding: 
[A] Pitch/Throw ball/Jump
[B] Base touch/Feint ball
[C] x
[D] Time out

* There is no infield fly rule in this game, which can be used to the advantage of a defender if there are base runners. Double plays and even triple plays are common because of this.

* A base runner cannot begin to steal bases until the pitcher has released the ball. In most baseball video games and in real life, a runner can begin to steal the next base at any time. However, stealing a base beforehand can only be done if you continuously press the steal button right after the screen cuts-back after the batter hit a foul ball, and the pitcher will not even notice you running.

* The 3rd baseman, 2nd baseman, and 1st baseman will not leave the base to retrieve a ball. They will instead stand on the base and wait for another fielder to get the ball, which can sometimes mean they will stand there while the ball rolls inches away from them. The only exception would be if the shortstop covers third or second base for the fielder; then they remain in the stationary position.

* Since the game has semi-automatic fielding, you cannot change which defensive player you want to run after the ball, which means sometimes the pitcher will end up chasing a ball well into the outfield.

* If a ball is hit far enough into the stands, it can sometimes become stuck, allowing the batter to garnish an in the park home run. Because of the reduced home run zone, faster players can often round the bases by hitting the ball up into the fair-zone stands.

* The computer players will always attempt to hit the ball straight, as if trying to hit a home run, no matter what the strength of the batter. This can sometimes give an unfair advantage to you, since they do not try to pull the ball just barely fair in order to get a hit. This has its downfall, in that some powerful players will hit home runs easily.

* You cannot play against a team from the other league.

* If you manage to score more than 100 runs, your score will turn back to zero, as there are only two spaces for your runs. Consequently, if you score 101 runs, and your opponent scores two runs, you will lose the game 01-02.

* You cannot change players positions in the field or line up without replacing them.

* If another player is in your line of path to throw the ball, they will catch the ball after you throw it. This means that if the shortstop retrieves a ground ball just behind 3rd base, then the throw will get cut-off by the 3rd baseman and then the pitcher before the ball gets to 1st base. The pitcher will almost always get in the way, and this can present a problem when trying to pull a double play between third and first or second and home.

Now the games may continue in the famed Cyber-Egg Stadium where only power and skill will determine the winner!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Play the original Pac-Man: At the game select screen press Up(x3), Down(x3), Left, Right, Left, Right, Left. If you did it correctly, the sound heard in both Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man when you gain an extra life will play, and Pinky will take Blinky's place on the Press Start screen. Press the Ms. Pac-Man Start button and you will play "Pac-Man". After the game is over, the original Pac-Man's attract mode sequence will run for one cycle.

* To toggle the built-in speedup, insert coins then enter the following sequence: Left, Right, Left, Right, Up(x3), Fire. If you did it correctly, the sound heard in both Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man when you eat a bonus fruit item will play. This will toggle the speed in both Ms Pac-Man &amp; Pac-Man as well as provide a 'Fast Shot' in Galaga.

Play Galaga for free: During the Galaga demonstration, wait until the Galaga Commander uses the tractor beam. Before it sucks up the ship, press fire and kill it. You now have total control and can play the sample level. However, finish quick or an error screen will come up. The game will function normally though.

- UPDATES -

* 1.50 (May 5, 2010)
- The left ramp and the sniper post were holding onto the ball for too long (in some cases). This has been corrected.
- Ball search was allowed to run when the ball was being held on the left ramp for choreography. This has been corrected.
- Fixed operating system bug that would cause the music volume to spike up to a high level and remain there until the game was power cycled.

* 1.44 (September 2, 2009)
- Fixed a problem with persistent style auditing that could cause the game to stop running in 50HZ countries.
- Roughed in a rule for 'Escape'.
- Added lamp effects and display effects.
- Roughed in 'Save the President' and 'Master Agent' modes.
- Fixed a problem with the game over "music".  If a high score was earned and the match effect did not run at game-over (via tournament, or by the match feature being 'off'), then the high score to date music would run until a new game was started, or until the game was power-cycled. This has been corrected.
- Fixed a problem with the NUKE jackpot. The score was being initialized at power-up and then only increased. This would eventually result in massive NUKE jackpot scores if the game was never powered off. This has been corrected.

- Extra ball and Special were not scoring points when the corresponding awards could not be given out. This has been corrected.

- Some background lamp effects that used the flashlamps were not being killed at the start of bonus. This has been corrected.

- The wizard mode requirement for 'safe house jackpot' was being awarded in the wrong place, this has been corrected.
- Added more lamp effects, display effects, and sounds.

* 1.30 (March 4, 2009)
- suitcase stepper now goes to correct position at power up and during test mode.

This game came in an upright format. The cabinet was painted blue with simple striped sideart. The marquee was integrated into the monitor bezel and may bear one of three different titles (with four distinct marquees/bezels). The most common one showed a picture of a yellow Datsun 280Z and said '280 Zzzap', the other three versions had stripes that matched the side of the machine, and were labeled either 'Midnight Racer', '280 Zzzap', or 'Datsun 280 Zzzap'. This game uses a 23'' black and white television as a monitor.

Controls: 
Steering wheel, Gear shift (low &amp; high), Gas pedal

- TRIVIA -

Datsun 280 Zzzap was released in November 1976.

Originally called 'Midnite Racer' when Midway acquired the right from Digital Games to create the game (January 1976). Midway released their final version 10 months after at the AMOA as 'Datsun 280 Zzzap'. Here is the reason for the game's name change: Midway came up with a marketing promotion where winners in various categories would win a Datsun 280Z. Realizing that their driving game would be a perfect tie-in, they renamed it Datsun 280 Zzzap.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

You control a car through a night time scene, and the road is represented by simple posts at the edges. The top of the screen will display information about upcoming curves (like the maximum safe speed to take them at), while the bottom of the screen has a speedometer, timer, scoreboard, and may also display a few tips as well. Just drive, and don't crash. Pay attention to your speed on the corners to avoid crashing.

Sega Genesis 32X (c) 1994 Sega of America, Inc.

The Sega Genesis 32X is an add-on for the Sega Genesis video game console. Codenamed 'Project Mars', the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the 32-bit era until the later release of the Sega Saturn. Independent of the Genesis, the 32X utilizes its own ROM cartridges and has its own library of games.

- TECHNICAL -

Model No. MK-84000A

CPU: 2 x SH-2 32-bit RISC (23 MHz)
Memory: 2Mbit RAM
Display: 320 x 240 resolution, 32768 on-screen colors.
Dimensions: 110 x 210 x 100 mm (4.3 x 8.3 x 3.9 in).
Weight: 495 g. (17.5 oz)

- TRIVIA -

Unveiled at June 1994's Consumer Electronics Show, Sega presented the 32X as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games. Developed in response to the Atari Jaguar and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994, the product was originally conceived as an entirely new console. At the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful. The final design contained two 32-bit central processing unit chips and a 3-D graphics processor. In order to bring the new add-on to market by its scheduled release date of November 21, 1994, development of the new system and its games were rushed.

Ultimately, the console failed to attract third-party video game developers and sufficient consumers due to the announcement of the Sega Saturn's simultaneous release in Japan. Sega's efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into available time for game development, resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully utilize the add-on's hardware, including Genesis ports. By the end of 1994, the 32X had sold 665,000 units. After price reductions in 1995, it was officially discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned their focus toward the Saturn.

3 Bags Full (c) 1995 Aristocrat.

A 5-reel video slot machine.

- TECHNICAL -

Released on Aristocrat MK2.5, MKIV and MKV hardware.

The MK2.5 and MKIV versions are compatible with both boards, however the Jubilee MKIV version has additional ROMs, which are also larger in capacity, and only runs on a MKIV board. The MK5 version runs on completely different hardware.

CPU (MK2.5 and MKIV): Motorola M6809
CPU (MKV): ARM250

Sound (MK2.5 and MKIV): 2x AY-3-8910A (@ 1.5MHz).
Sound (MK5): Acorn VIDC.

Screen Orientation: Horizontal
Screen Resolution (MK2.5 and MKIV): 304 x 216 pixels.
Screen Resolution (MK5): 640 x 400 pixels.
Refresh Rate: 60Hz.

The Jubilee MKIV version has a slightly different display compared to the MK2.5/MKIV version, with larger numbers, a coloured background replacing the rectangular border, and the reel graphics have been updated to look more like the artwork.

- TRIVIA -

Unlike most games, this game pays for all two-of-a-kind wins, with the exception of Money Bags and scattered Slot Machines.

The Wolf character was also featured in the game "Q.T. Bird".

The US MK2.5/MKIV version uses the same program ROMs for Fortune Hunter.

- SCORING -

All pays are left to right except for scattered Slot Machines. Sheep substitutes for all symbols except Slot Machine.

Paytable (Australian and US versions):
Sheep: 1 = 2, 2 = 5, 3 = 100, 4 = 1000, 5 = 5000
Fox: 2 = 5, 3 = 20, 4 = 100, 5 = 1000
Cat: 2 = 5, 3 = 20, 4 = 100, 5 = 1000

Slot Machine: 3 = 2, 4 = 10, 5 = 100

Paytable (New Zealand version):
Sheep: 2 = 5, 3 = 100, 4 = 600, 5 = 1000
Fox: 2 = 5, 3 = 20, 4 = 100, 5 = 800
Cat: 2 = 5, 3 = 20, 4 = 100, 5 = 800
Wolf: 2 = 5, 3 = 20, 4 = 100, 5 = 500
Glass: 2 = 5, 3 = 20, 4 = 100, 5 = 500
King: 2 = 2, 3 = 10, 4 = 25, 5 = 200
Queen: 2 = 2, 3 = 10, 4 = 25, 5 = 200
Jack: 2 = 2, 3 = 5, 4 = 20, 5 = 100
Ten: 2 = 2, 3 = 5, 4 = 20, 5 = 100
Money Bag: 3 = 5, 4 = 20, 5 = Feature
Slot Machine: 3 = 2, 4 = 15, 5 = 100

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

When 5 Money Bags occur on a lit line, a second screen bonus appears. On the second screen, you can pick three items, which have varying amounts of credits; these credits are all added and is then multiplied by the current bet per line. If all three bags are the same, the player can select the Bonus Bag.

The Sheep also substitutes for Money Bags, so it doesn't have to be all 5 of the same item to trigger the feature.

Fire Suplex was released on March 25, 1993 in Japan. It was developed by UPL and this is the last game developed by this manufacturer.

This game is known outside Japan as 3 Count Bout.

Fire Suplex is the only 'true' wrestling game for the SNK MVS Neo-Geo hardware but not the first. This honor goes to "King of The Monsters" (with giant monsters anyway!):)

Blues Hablam and Blubber Man are actually the same guy with the same ring attire, only Hablam sports a mask. The same occurs for Gochack Bigbomb and Big Bomberdir with Bigbomb wearing the mask.

The character Master Barnes enters the ring wearing Shoulder Spikes similar to the ones worn by legendary wrestling tag-team The Road Warriors.

- TRIVIA -

The FZ-1 3DO model was released on:
- October 04, 1993 in North America, Initially priced $699.99.
- March 20, 1994 in Japan.

R.E.A.L 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (often referred to as 3DO) is a set of technical specifications created by The 3DO Company. The 3DO Company was the result of a partnership between Matsushita, AT&amp;T, Time Warner, MCA, Electronic Arts, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (a venture capital firm) and the New Technologies Group (NTG). None of these companies ever manufactured a single console. Other manufacturing companies (in the end only Panasonic, Goldstar and Sanyo) could license the rights to create their own console and label them as 3DO, by simply fulfilling the required specifications.

The system was conceived by Trip Hawkins, the man who created Electronic Arts in 1982, and its technologies were originally designed by Dave Needle and Robert J. Mical of New Technology Group, which already designed the Atari Lynx.

Technically, a 3DO system can run 3DO Interactive software, play audio CD's (including support for CD+G), view Photo-CDs and even play Video CD's by using a special add-on MPEG1 FMV cartridge (this cartridge was only available for the American Goldstar and Japanese Panasonic 3DO systems).

Despite a highly-promoted launch and its advanced technology, 3DO never met the expected success. The main reason for this has probably to be sought in the system's high price, not balanced by high quality titles, neither at launch nor immediately after. For sure, few titles exploited the full potential of the console, and the most well-received titles were often ports of games from other systems. This prevented any real 3DO penetration in the console market.

3DO Company's official position about the price was that 3DO was a high-end audio-visual system rather than a simple videogame console, so the price was fair. Only in 1996 they announced a price drop, probably to help the diffusion and popularity before the launch of the promised next-gen console M2, but it was definitely too late.

The 3DO system was eventually discontinued at the end of 1996 with a complete shutdown of all internal hardware development and divestment of the M2 technology. 3DO restructured themselves around this same time, becoming a multi-platform software company until its bankrupt in 2003.

These groups may be made up of three matching tiles, or the number sets, 1-3, 4-6, or 7-9. The objective is to find the four, three-tile sets shown at the start of the stage and remove them from the game board before the timer runs out.

When a tile is selected, other tiles are lit up.  Tiles within the number sequence are shown in pink, and matching tiles are shown in orange.  The player may request hints by selecting the help button on screen, which will light up all tiles that can be removed from the board at that time.  There is also a back button, which the player may select to return tiles to the screen.

The background image in each stage is an image of a girl.  Each girl has two background images, with the second image showing the girl topless. Once a player removes the four tile sets for the stage, the board is cleared and the player may see the entire image.

After completing a stage the player may use the points he has earned to buy power-ups, such as extra hints or a faster cursor.

The game is over once the timer has run out or if the player cannot legally remove any more tiles and the board is 'deadlocked'.  Upon continuing the player may select to play the same board or play a different one.

- TRIVIA -

Released in August 1996 in Japan.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Three Engraved Intentions - ?Thought Puzzle Game!'.

The 'Sankokushi' here is a play on the 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' saga (known as 'Sankokushi'), but the kanji reads 'three engraved intentions' to refer to the mahjong tiles which must be matched to clear each stage.

- TRIVIA -

Released in May 1984.

This video game is based on the movie shorts and full-length movies that feature the characters of the same name. The Three Stooges were an American vaudeville and comedy act of the early to mid–20th century best known for their numerous short subject films. Their hallmark was physical farce and extreme slapstick. In films, the Stooges were commonly known by their first names: Moe, Larry, and Curly and Moe, Larry, and Shemp, among other lineups. The film trio was originally composed of Moe Howard, brother Shemp Howard and Larry Fine. Curly Howard replaced brother Shemp, who later returned when Curly suffered a debilitating stroke in May 1946.

Speech's list in the game:
'Hello' (Moe when chosen as a player)
'Hello' (Larry when chosen as a player)
'Hello' (Curly when chosen as a player)
'Oh a wise guy, huh' (Moe, Larry or Curly when contacted)
'Oh a wise guy, huh' (Larry when contacted)
'Oh a wise guy, huh' (Curly when contacted)
'Cheese it boys, it's the cops' (Moe when cops enter room)
'Ow' (Moe when hit with hammer or slapped).

'What's the matter, knucklehead' (Moe when contacted)
'Aaahhh' (Larry when contacted)
'Hey, watch out' (Larry when contacted)
'Yak Yak Yak' (Curly when contacted)
'Nayaugh Nayaugh Nayaugh' (Curly when contacted)

a. Larry = 500 points.
b. Moe = 500 points.
c. Curly = 500 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

The object of the Three Stooges game is to rescue the three brides, Cora, Nora and Dora from the evil Doctor, I.M.Acad M.D.

One, two, or three players can choose their favortie Stooge and play either as a team, or against one another. In a one player game, the game is played against the computer.

The game consist of seven scenes:
1. The Office
2. The Parlor
3. The Kitchen
4. The Singers
5. The Art Gallery
6. The Police Station
7. The Laboratory

The Player must pick up their respectively colored key in each of the seven scenes, and exit the room. Each scene is repreated in all four levels of difficulty.

The game play starts with all three Stooges in the midst of the first scene, the Office. With the help of the player controlled joystick, the player searches for a hammer. Width the hammer the player can either break furniture to find the keys, or hit the cops and villians which are worth point. The player can also pick up pies, which are located on unbreakable tables and throw them at unsuspecting cops and villians. The player must be careful though, because a pie thrown haphazardly will break windows along the sidewalls encouraging more cops to enter the room. Picking up a pie will also cause the player to lose the hammer. If a player chooses to slap a villian will be stunned and if a hammer was being carried, it will be dropped.

Each scene is completed when all three keys are retrieved and the Three Stooges exit the room. All three keys must be picked up to open the exit door.

The players must be very careful during the Singer scene. The key for each of the players is located in one of the smaller rooms. When entering the room the player must be quick about retrieving the key because the opera singers 'blue note' is lethal. The singers can be silenced by hitting them in the face with a pie.

During the first level of the Laboratory scene, there are no brides present. The evil doctor, I.M.Acad M.D., stands atop the laboratory and as the players pick up their keys the Doctor starts leaving the room. The players must exit in time to capture the Doctor or the round begins over again.

The first of the three brides Cora, appears at the start of the second level 'Laboratory' game. The players must retrieve the keys to change the color of the cage in which Cora is locked. The cae must then be broken with a hammer, Cora rescued, and exit the room.

Nora, the second bride appears during the third 'Laboratory' round and Dora, the third bride, appears during the fourth.

When Dora has been saved, this will complete the first four levels of the game. The game now repeats the order of the first four levels, with the evil Doctor coming out again in the Laboratory scene of level five.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 29 years ago:

Mahjong 4P Simasyo (c) 1994 Sphinx.

An adult, mahjong game, Mahjong 4P Simasyo features images of live action AV actresses and one actor representing the player. Game play starts with a four player match against three CPU controlled girls. Once the player wins this match he is rewarded with a still shot of a topless model in all of her pixelated glory.  The player then selects one of the three girls from the previous match for a one-on-one game. The player then plays against that girl until he defeats her three times or he wins all of her money. Once defeated the girl is shown nude in a low frame-rate "video" of her body bouncing up and down in a suggestive fashion.
After this the player again competes in a 4-player round against the same girls until all three have been defeated in one-on-one matches. Game play then continues with a new set of three girls.

		<desc>Arcade Video game published 42 years ago:

600 (c) 1981 Konami.

600 is a maze game where the player is a turtle trying to bring baby turtles, called 'kidturtles' to their homes while avoiding beetles. Scattered throughout the maze are boxes with question marks on them. When the player walks over a question mark, a baby turtle will crawl onto the main turtle's back, a house will appear at a random location on the map, and the player will have to bring the baby turtle to its house while avoiding beetles. 

Other times, beetles will come out of the boxes, which the player will have to quickly run away from. The player's only offensive move is the ability to drop "smart bombs" to temporarily stun the beetles. The player's smart bombs can be refilled by grabbing the smart bombs in the middle of the maze. However, unlike actual smart bombs, the player's bombs do not move and stay in a single place until a beetle runs over it. 

You have eight floors to deal with the beetles, then you'll go to the roof to get your baby turtles, after you go get them, you walk home with the rest of the baby turtles you collected. The game pattern is endless.

- TRIVIA -

600 was released in November 1981.

This title is similar in concept to Frogger, but closely resembles the much later "Super Pac-Man" in gameplay. Konami originally wrote this game (which they mysteriously titled 600), but it was licensed to Stern for US and European distribution (released in December 1981 as Turtles), and only a limited number of games were made bearing the 600 name. Konami also licensed this title to Sega as well, which they released under the name "Turpin".

- SCORING -

Race Car runs into mine: 50 points.
Uncover a Race Car: 80 points.
Uncover a KidTurtle: 100 points.
Bring KidTurtles Home: 150 points.

- TRIVIA -

64th. Street was released in March 1991. It is a precursor to Jaleco's "Rushing Beat" series on the Nintendo Super Famicom. The series' main character (Rick Norton) shares both the name of the main character (Rick) with the appearance of the supporting character (Allen).

The game's two protagonists make a cameo appearance in another Jaleco game, "Chimera Beast".

This game is probably the earliest (and sadly, one of very, very few) beat 'em up that allows the player to throw the enemy into the background, providing both an increased damage output and a somewhat nice looking dose of scenario destruction. Another game that allowed for this particular move to be performed was the Super Nintendo adaptation of Batman Returns, by Konami.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

Lots of special items can be found by throwing enemies into the background and breaking things.

Massive throw damage: When you grab an enemy, pressing Up on the joystick followed by the Attack button will make you throw the enemy onto the background, dealing quite a bigger amount of damage than the regular side throw; and in some cases (like in levels 2 and 3), it'll allow you to kill an enemy with a single move.

720° (c) 1986 Atari Games. 

720° is a one or two-player arcade game with players taking on the role of a skateboarder, and must perform various tricks and maneuvers to earn the points and tickets needed to compete for medals in the game's numerous skate parks. 

The bulk of the action takes place in a 'Skate City', a small urban area made up of ramps, jumps and hazards. Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes. 

Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds. 

The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded. 

Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start. 

At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game. 

The main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. There are numerous city hazards to be avoided, such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers and other skaters. To guide the player around Skate City are map tiles. Riding over one of these will temporaily pause the action and display the layout of the city, including the locations of the skate parks and equipment stalls. 

720° features ten 'class levels' which determine the degree of difficulty in the skate parks and the timer in the city streets. Each of the four skate parks is graded in difficulty, ranging from 1 (easiest) to 4 (hardest). 

By using the add-a-coin option available in the 'Advanced' game mode, players can keep any special skate equipment they have acquired in the previous game, as well as all accumulated cash, tickets, points and medals.

* Superior graphics and animation for more player involvement.
* Realistic skateboard action lets players attempt daring maneuvers.
* Players select where they want to skate, making each game a different experience.
* New rotary controller allows full directional and circular motions.
* Contemporary cabinet design with new 25" higher-resolution monitor.

720° has all the thrills and skills of real skateboarding with both freestyle and competitive action. A totally unique game format challenges players to become champion of the skating world.

* Start by skating to a skatepark to select difficulty.
* Perform skate maneuvers in the city to earn tickets to get into a skatepark.
* The "Ramp" is one of over 20 skateparks.

By definition, a 720° is one of the most daring moves attempted only by the best, where the skater does a full 720-degree twist while soaring through the air. In 720°, the game, players can attempt to perform this move without bodily injury. This is only part of the fantasy world of 720°...

* Unique Action and Game Format.
The player portrays the skater who must earn the right to compete in the skateparks of the city and ultimately win the title of champion of the skating world. The action starts with the player in the middel of "Skate City", where all surfaces are skateable - a skateboarder's dream world! The player earns tickets by performing skillful skate maneuvers in the city.

These tickets allow him to enter the skateparks where he competes against the clock fot gold, silver or bronze medals. "Cash" prizes are awarded to the skater if he qualifies for a medal. After the skatepark competition, the game continues back in the city for more freestyle action. Numerous hazards and obstacles create a busy scenario in the city, and the skater has a limited time to get to another skatepark.

Players can use their "cash" winnings to buy skating equipment from various skate shops though-out the city. 
- BOARDS will give the player faster speed. 
- HELMETs allow more risk-taking for successful maneuvers. 
- PADS give faster recovery from falls. 
- SHOES provide better height on jumps and quicker starts.

* New Controls
Players controls consist of a rotary controller which allows full circular and directional movement. A kick button keeps the player skating, and a jump button is used to "catch air" for higher points. Anything goes in this game, as players learn to make incredible skate maneuvers.

* More Visual and Audio Entertainment.
720° has a new 25" higher-resolution monitor for better graphics and animation than ever before. Plus, 8" speakers highlight the custom music,  sound effects and speech, making the player feel like he's tight there in the action. 

* Operator Features
720° is equipped with the comprehensive self-test and statistics package on all recent Atari Games products. Operator difficulty adjustments are also provided by four different option switches.

* Special Game Features
- In 720° players create their own game action as they select where they want to skate. PLayers will find map areas in the city which will momentarily display the layout of the city and the skatepark locations.
- Players can select the class level in which they want to compete. At the start of each game, players skate towards one of four skateparks which very in difficulty from "novice" to "pro". As the game progresses players automatically advance to the next level.
- Players can compete on over 20 skateparks, each requires a different skill. There are variations of a half-pipe ramp, a downhill, a slalom and a jump park.
- The city is filled with hazards which the player must avoid, including: street traffic, BMX bikers, skater gangs, and frisbee throwers/
- An Add-a-Coin feature lets players stay in the action and keep any special skate equipment acquired.

Game ID: 136047

Runs on the "Atari System 2" hardware.

Players: 2
Control: Circular rotating joystick
Buttons: 2
=&gt; [1] Kick, [2] Jump

The cabinet for this game was unique at this time. The speakers for the game are mounted atop the cabinet in a structure resembling a boom box, in line with the game's skate-kid theme. The display is larger than that for a typical arcade game and of a very high resolution (similar to that used for "Paperboy"). The main control is also unique. This joystick moves in a circular fashion, instead of in compass directions like standard joysticks.

* Dimensions
Height: 74.0 in, 188 cm.
Width: 27.5 in, 70 cm.
Depth: 38.0 in, 97 cm.

- TRIVIA -

720° was released in December 1986.

2,265 units were produced in the USA. The selling price was $2,995.

720° is notable in that it is one of the first extreme sports video games. The game's name comes from the 'ultimate' skateboarding trick; turning a full 720° (2 complete circles) in the air after jumping off a ramp.

Ron Perelman holds the record for this game with 527,100 points on June 17, 1987.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Develop skill in using the rotary control in conjunction with the Jump button to do aerial moves, because they are worth more points. Press the Jump button after gaining speed, and then rotate the control in a 360-degree motion. In this game, it is possible to do much more than just a 360-degree turn!

* When attempting certain aerial or rotational moves, it is important to be properly aligned on landing, otherwise the skater bails, or falls down.

* To qualify for medals in the higher classes of skate parks, it is best to try to buy some skate equipment first to allow players to perform harder moves.

* Daring players should try to wait out the timer in the streets, performing skate moves and acquiring points until the timer is about to expire.

* In the ramp park, a good trick is to constantly push the kick button and do skid-outs at the top of each side of the half-pipe. To do this, get to the lip of the ramp, hold the stick parallel with the lip, and stop pressing kick. This will cause you to grind and skid down the ramp. You will be awarded big points at the lip and at the base of the ramp. This procedure may be repeated over and over for some incredible (effortless) high scores.

* Don't forget to visit the skate shops. Do not underestimate what a new board and shoes do for you. Buying new equipment allows you to move faster, jump farther, recover faster, and pull off more tricks.

* In the ramp section, levels 8, 9, and 10: holding down the kick and jump buttons simultaneously on the lip of the ramp will boost your air. This trick only works when you're going the correct speed (usually your third or fourth jump), and only once (as far as I can tell) per ramp session per level.

* The entire game should focus around the Sessions skate park (the blue park in the right quadrant of the play-field). Making multiple passes through this park will greatly increase your scores. Remember to keep jumping and spinning. A good game should leave you feeling completely exhausted!

720° (c) 1986 Atari Games. 

720° is a one or two-player arcade game with players taking on the role of a skateboarder, and must perform various tricks and maneuvers to earn the points and tickets needed to compete for medals in the game's numerous skate parks. 

The bulk of the action takes place in a 'Skate City', a small urban area made up of ramps, jumps and hazards. Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes. 

Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds. 

The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded. 

Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start. 

At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game. 

The main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. There are numerous city hazards to be avoided, such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers and other skaters. To guide the player around Skate City are map tiles. Riding over one of these will temporaily pause the action and display the layout of the city, including the locations of the skate parks and equipment stalls. 

720° features ten 'class levels' which determine the degree of difficulty in the skate parks and the timer in the city streets. Each of the four skate parks is graded in difficulty, ranging from 1 (easiest) to 4 (hardest). 

By using the add-a-coin option available in the 'Advanced' game mode, players can keep any special skate equipment they have acquired in the previous game, as well as all accumulated cash, tickets, points and medals.

* Unique Action and Game Format.
The player portrays the skater who must earn the right to compete in the skateparks of the city and ultimately win the title of champion of the skating world.

The player earns tickets by performing skillful skate maneuvers in the city.

These tickets allow him to enter the skateparks where he competes against the clock fot gold, silver or bronze medals. "Cash" prizes are awarded to the skater if he qualifies for a medal. After the skatepark competition, the game continues back in the city for more freestyle action.

Game ID: 136047

Runs on the "Atari System 2" hardware.

Players: 2
Control: Circular rotating joystick
Buttons: 2
=&gt; [1] Kick, [2] Jump

The cabinet for this game was unique at this time. The speakers for the game are mounted atop the cabinet in a structure resembling a boom box, in line with the game's skate-kid theme. The display is larger than that for a typical arcade game and of a very high resolution (similar to that used for "Paperboy"). The main control is also unique. This joystick moves in a circular fashion, instead of in compass directions like standard joysticks.

* Dimensions
Height: 74.0 in, 188 cm.
Width: 27.5 in, 70 cm.
Depth: 38.0 in, 97 cm.

- TRIVIA -

720° was released in December 1986.

2,265 units were produced in the USA. The selling price was $2,995.

720° is notable in that it is one of the first extreme sports video games. The game's name comes from the 'ultimate' skateboarding trick; turning a full 720° (2 complete circles) in the air after jumping off a ramp.

Ron Perelman holds the record for this game with 527,100 points on June 17, 1987.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Develop skill in using the rotary control in conjunction with the Jump button to do aerial moves, because they are worth more points. Press the Jump button after gaining speed, and then rotate the control in a 360-degree motion. In this game, it is possible to do much more than just a 360-degree turn!

* When attempting certain aerial or rotational moves, it is important to be properly aligned on landing, otherwise the skater bails, or falls down.

* To qualify for medals in the higher classes of skate parks, it is best to try to buy some skate equipment first to allow players to perform harder moves.

* Daring players should try to wait out the timer in the streets, performing skate moves and acquiring points until the timer is about to expire.

* In the ramp park, a good trick is to constantly push the kick button and do skid-outs at the top of each side of the half-pipe. To do this, get to the lip of the ramp, hold the stick parallel with the lip, and stop pressing kick. This will cause you to grind and skid down the ramp. You will be awarded big points at the lip and at the base of the ramp. This procedure may be repeated over and over for some incredible (effortless) high scores.

* Don't forget to visit the skate shops. Do not underestimate what a new board and shoes do for you. Buying new equipment allows you to move faster, jump farther, recover faster, and pull off more tricks.

* In the ramp section, levels 8, 9, and 10: holding down the kick and jump buttons simultaneously on the lip of the ramp will boost your air. This trick only works when you're going the correct speed (usually your third or fourth jump), and only once (as far as I can tell) per ramp session per level.

* The entire game should focus around the Sessions skate park (the blue park in the right quadrant of the play-field). Making multiple passes through this park will greatly increase your scores. Remember to keep jumping and spinning. A good game should leave you feeling completely exhausted!

Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes. 

Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds. 

The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded. 

Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start. 

At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game. 

The main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. There are numerous city hazards to be avoided, such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers and other skaters. To guide the player around Skate City are map tiles. Riding over one of these will temporaily pause the action and display the layout of the city, including the locations of the skate parks and equipment stalls. 

720° features ten 'class levels' which determine the degree of difficulty in the skate parks and the timer in the city streets. Each of the four skate parks is graded in difficulty, ranging from 1 (easiest) to 4 (hardest). 

By using the add-a-coin option available in the 'Advanced' game mode, players can keep any special skate equipment they have acquired in the previous game, as well as all accumulated cash, tickets, points and medals.

Runs on the "Atari System 2" hardware.

Players: 2
Control: Circular rotating joystick
Buttons: 2
=&gt; [1] Kick, [2] Jump

The cabinet for this game was unique at this time. The speakers for the game are mounted atop the cabinet in a structure resembling a boom box, in line with the game's skate-kid theme. The display is larger than that for a typical arcade game and of a very high resolution (similar to that used for "Paperboy"). The main control is also unique. This joystick moves in a circular fashion, instead of in compass directions like standard joysticks.

- TRIVIA -

720° was released in December 1986.

2,265 units were produced in the USA. The selling price was $2,995.

720° is notable in that it is one of the first extreme sports video games. The game's name comes from the 'ultimate' skateboarding trick; turning a full 720° (2 complete circles) in the air after jumping off a ramp.

Ron Perelman holds the record for this game with 527,100 points on June 17, 1987.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Develop skill in using the rotary control in conjunction with the Jump button to do aerial moves, because they are worth more points. Press the Jump button after gaining speed, and then rotate the control in a 360-degree motion. In this game, it is possible to do much more than just a 360-degree turn!

* When attempting certain aerial or rotational moves, it is important to be properly aligned on landing, otherwise the skater bails, or falls down.

* To qualify for medals in the higher classes of skate parks, it is best to try to buy some skate equipment first to allow players to perform harder moves.

* Daring players should try to wait out the timer in the streets, performing skate moves and acquiring points until the timer is about to expire.

* In the ramp park, a good trick is to constantly push the kick button and do skid-outs at the top of each side of the half-pipe. To do this, get to the lip of the ramp, hold the stick parallel with the lip, and stop pressing kick. This will cause you to grind and skid down the ramp. You will be awarded big points at the lip and at the base of the ramp. This procedure may be repeated over and over for some incredible (effortless) high scores.

* Don't forget to visit the skate shops. Do not underestimate what a new board and shoes do for you. Buying new equipment allows you to move faster, jump farther, recover faster, and pull off more tricks.

* In the ramp section, levels 8, 9, and 10: holding down the kick and jump buttons simultaneously on the lip of the ramp will boost your air. This trick only works when you're going the correct speed (usually your third or fourth jump), and only once (as far as I can tell) per ramp session per level.

* The entire game should focus around the Sessions skate park (the blue park in the right quadrant of the play-field). Making multiple passes through this park will greatly increase your scores. Remember to keep jumping and spinning. A good game should leave you feeling completely exhausted!

7 Ordi (c) 2002 Yun Sung.

7 Ordi is a seven card stud medal game. Once the player meets the minimum number of credits the player is dealt a hand. Three cards are dealt to the player and the computer and one card is chosen to show face up.  Next a card is dealt and a round of betting takes place. Two more cards are dealt face up with a round of betting after each. Then one more card is dealt face down with one more round of betting.

If the player wins then the player may choose to either take his winnings or play a mini-game where he bets on whether the next card will be a low card (1-5), a high card (6-10), or a face card (J,Q,K). After every winning guess the player may choose to continue or drop out.

Hands are dealt until the players credits fall below the minimum level to play.

Player: 2
Control: mahjong keyboard

- TRIVIA -

Released in February 1988 in Japan. This game was also released the same month as "Mahjong Gakuen - Sotsugyohen".

The title of this game translates roughly from Japanese as 'Seven Pairs - 10,000 Yen Goes, Another 10,000 Yen Comes'.

The subtitle is a play on a Japanese proverb 'Ichinan satte, mata ichinan', which means 'One misfortune goes, another one comes'. An 'Ichiman' is a 10,000 yen note, the highest note of Japanese currency.

In mahjong, a 'toitsu' is a pair of like tiles waiting for a third like tile to create a three-of-a-kind. However, 'chi-toitsu' also denotes a special winning mahjong hand made of seven pairs of tiles. Winning with a chi-toitsu guarantees a good score!

DO YOU WANT A WINNER
Here it is!
8-BALL ACTION

It's priced right to give you phenomenal return on investment. It's a simple conversion that enables you to convert quickly and easily those old Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr. games

Birdie King: $2500
8-Ball Action: Under $400

We will make them earn for you today!

PROOF:

Amiga 1000 (c) 1985 Commodore, Limited.

- TRIVIA -

The Commodore Amiga 1000 was the first in the Amiga line of personal computers released by Commodore International. Before the release of the Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 models in 1987, the A1000 was simply called Amiga.

Introduced on July 23, 1985 at the Lincoln Center in New York City, machines began shipping in September with a base configuration of 256 kB of RAM at the retail price of US$1,295. A 13-inch (330 mm) analog RGB monitor was available for around US$300, bringing the price of a complete Amiga system to 1,595 USD.

In the US, the A1000 was marketed as The Amiga from Commodore, though the Commodore logo was omitted from the case. Additionally, the Amiga 1000 was sold exclusively in computer stores rather than the various non computer-dedicated department and toy stores through which the VIC20 and Commodore 64 were retailed. These measures were an effort to avoid Commodore's toy-store computer image created during the Tramiel era.



The conceptor of the Amiga 1000 was Jay Miner, who created the Atari 800 many years before. He wanted to make the most powerful computer ever, then he joined a little California company called Amiga. He used the principle of the three coprocessors (again) to help the main processor. At the beginning, the Amiga had only 64 kilobytes of RAM!, Atari wanted to buy the Amiga but finally, Commodore succeeded to buy it (then there was a lawsuit, which Commodore won). It was meant to be a competitor to the Atari 520 ST.

The operating system was done by Metacomco, a British company who specialized in the 68000 processor (they also made languages for the Sinclair QL). It is a fully multitasking system which looks like UNIX with a graphical user interface. It was the very first personal computer with great graphics and sound capabilities with a GUI environment. Along with the operating system, the machine came bundled with a version of AmigaBASIC developed by Microsoft and a speech synthesis library developed by Softvoice, Inc.

The Amiga 1000 began to lose popularity one year later with the creation of its two main successors: the Amiga 500 and the Amiga 2000.

Atari 1200XL (c) 1982 Atari, Incorporated.

Atari 8-bit computer.

- TECHNICAL -

WHAT's NEW:
- New aluminum and smoked plastic cases
- 64 KB of RAM
- Only two joystick ports
- Help key
- Four function keys.

- TRIVIA -

Released in late 1982, the Atari 1200XL was an odd hybrid of features from the Sweet 8/16 projects. Notable features were 64 KB of RAM, built-in self test, redesigned keyboard, and redesigned cable port layout. In general terms the 1200XL most closely matched the high end Sweet 16 concept.
However the 1200XL also included a number of missing or poorly implemented features. The PBI expansion connector from the original 1000X design was left off, making the design rely entirely on SIO again. Frustrating this was the fact that the +12V pin in the SIO port was left unconnected; only +5V power was available although some devices made use of the +12V line. An improved video circuit provided more chroma for a more colorful image, but the chroma line was not connected to the monitor port, the only place that could make use of it. Even the re-arrangement of the ports made some joysticks and cartridges difficult or impossible to use. Changes made to the operating system to support the new hardware also resulted in compatibility problems with some older software that did not follow published guidelines.

The 1200XL ended up with functionality similar to the existing 800, but at a hefty price point. For all of these reasons the 1200XL sold poorly. There is an often-repeated story, perhaps apocryphal, that 800 sales shot up after the release of the 1200XL, as existing owners tried to snap them up before they disappeared. The machine was discontinued in 1983. There was no PAL version of the 1200XL.

- TECHNICAL -

Original machines in beige cases and has a membrane keyboard.

- TRIVIA -

The Atari 400 and 800 were the first home computers to use custom coprocessors and the first to use 'sprites' and special video interruptions like display lists, features that will be implemented several years after on the Commodore Amiga. It offered high graphic resolution, lots of colors and great sound capabilities, more than other computers could do then!

The two models had same characteristics, the 400 is the low-cost version, it has only 16 KB (instead of 48 KB), one cartridge port (two for the 800) and a membrane keyboard (a typewriter style keyboard one for the 800).
